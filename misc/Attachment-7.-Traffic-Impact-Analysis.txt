EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction:
This report summarizes the potential traffic circulation issues associated with the proposed
Monterey Salinas Transit (MST) South County Maintenance and Operations facility in King
City, California. Vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle and transit circulation issues were evaluated at
the project site and the surrounding street network in King City, along with assessment of site
access and on-site circulation. The project site is located on San Antonio Drive at Don Bates
Way, in the East Ranch Business Park.

Study Network:
The AM and PM peak periods were analyzed at the following intersections:
   1. River Drive – Southbound US 101 Ramps / Broadway Circle
   2. Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street
   3. First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps
   4. First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps
   5. First Street / Lonoak Road
   6. Firs Street / Broadway Street
   7. Metz Road / Bitterwater Road
   8. Metz Road / San Antonio Drive
   9. San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road

Traffic operations for the following analysis scenarios were analyzed:
     Existing Conditions
     Existing Plus Project Conditions
     Background Conditions
     Background Plus Project Conditions
     Cumulative Without Project Conditions
     Cumulative Plus Project Conditions

The analysis was performed using the 2000 and 2010 Highway Capacity Manual methodologies.

Existing Conditions:
All of the study intersections currently operate at or better than their level of service standards.

Existing Plus Project Conditions:

Trip Generation Estimate:
A custom trip generation estimate was prepared for this project, based upon information
provided by MST and various assumptions regarding anticipated operations of this facility. This
includes the five types of trip generators at the project site:
    1. Buses and Shuttles
    2. Staff
    3. Relief Units
    4. Deliveries
    5. Visitors
                                                                                              PAGE V
The vast majority of project morning traffic will occur before the AM peak hour. The vast
majority of project evening traffic will occur before or after the street PM peak hour. The project
is estimated to generate about 263 daily trips, with 4 trips (2in, 2 out) during the AM peak hour
and 4 trips (2 in, 2 out) during the PM peak hour.

Traffic Circulation:

Vehicle Circulation:
All of the study intersections would continue to operate at or better than their respective level of
service standards under Existing Plus Project conditions. No project-specific impacts will occur
and no mitigations are required. The project is also a unique land use in that it supports the
development and operation of a transit system that will reduce overall traffic volumes throughout
the study area. Recent studies indicate that MST transit operations currently have about a 0.5%
mode share in rural areas. In other words, the introduction of enhanced transit service in King
City that will be able to occur due to the South County Operations and Maintenance Facility will
reduce traffic on the arterial street system by about 0.5%. This is not directly accounted for in
the traffic operations analysis. However, the 0.5% traffic reduction is credited toward the
project’s contribution to background and cumulative mitigations identified in this analysis.

Pedestrian Circulation:
No significant impacts, as the project would generate little pedestrian traffic.    The final design
plans will include a a sidewalk along its San Antonio Drive and Don Bates Way frontages.

Bicycle Circulation:
No significant impacts, as the project would generate little bicycle traffic.

Transit Circulation:
No significant impacts, as the project would generate little, if any, increase in transit usage.

Railroad Circulation:
No significant impacts, as the project would generate no additional railroad passenger use, all of
the at-grade crossings near the project site have existing crossing gates, and buses traveling
to/from the site would not have to stop at the at-grade crossings (because they would not have
passengers).

TAMC Regional Development Impact Fee:
The project is  a local public agency project. It is not subject to the Transportation Agency for
Monterey County (TAMC) regional development impact fee.

Background Conditions:
A list of approved but not yet constructed/operational projects was obtained from the City of
King. Vehicle trips from these projects were added to the existing volumes to create Background
condition traffic volumes.



                                                                                             PAGE VI
Traffic Circulation:
All of the study intersections would continue to operate at or better than their respective level of
service standards, with the exception of Intersection No. 6 - First Street / Broadway Street. 
Signalization of this intersection, as summarized on Exhibit ES-1, is the improvement needed at
this intersection to accommodate Background traffic conditions.

Background Plus Project Conditions:

Traffic Circulation:

Vehicle Circulation:
The project would contribute to impacts under Background Plus Project conditions at
Intersection No. 6 - First Street / Broadway Street.

Signalization of this intersection, as summarized on Exhibit ES-1, is the recommended
mitigation at this intersection.

Although it’s impact will be insignificant and virtually imperceptible, the project would be
responsible for a fair-share contribution of 0.41% towards the cost of implementing this
improvement, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to the intersection. The
project’s payment towards this improvement would constitute its contribution towards the
mitigation of Background plus Project conditions.

Pedestrian Circulation:
No significant impacts, as pedestrian traffic is not anticipated to significantly increase over
Existing Plus Project conditions.

Bicycle Circulation:
No significant impacts, as bicycle traffic is not anticipated to significantly increase over Existing
Plus Project conditions.

Cumulative Without Project Conditions:

Cumulative Without Project volumes are based on forecasts in “First Street Bypass Traffic
Impact Analysis,” Higgins Associates, June 12, 2009. These forecasts incorporate buildout of
the City of King General Plan. These forecasts also incorporate two important modifications to
the study area street network:
    1. Broadway Street extension (east of First Street)
    2. First Street Bypass (Bitterwater Road to Lonoak Road)




                                                                                           PAGE VII
Traffic Circulation:

Vehicle Circulation:
Only one of the study intersections (Intersection No. 1- River Drive-Southbound US 101 Ramps)
would continue to operate at or better than its level of service standard under Cumulative Plus
Project conditions, the following intersections would operate below their respective standards:
   2. Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street
   3. First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps
   4. First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps
   5. First Street / Lonoak Road
   6. First Street / Broadway Street
   7. Metz Road / Bitterwater Road
   8. Metz Road / San Antonio Drive
   9. San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road

See Exhibit ES-1 for the recommended improvements at these intersections. Implementation of
these improvements would reduce the level of cumulative impacts at each intersection to less-
than-significant.

Pedestrian Circulation:
There are no planned pedestrian network improvements in the vicinity of the project site.

Bicycle Circulation:
The City of King is planning to add bicycle lanes on First Street from US 101 to Bitterwater
Road and on Lonoak Road from First Street to the city limits. There are no additional planned
bicycle network improvements in the vicinity of the project site.

Cumulative Plus Project Conditions:
The project trip assignment under Cumulative Plus Project conditions has been revised due to the
inclusion of the First Street Bypass into the area street network. Approximately 80% of the
project traffic on First Street north of US 101 has been reassigned onto the Bypass, including all
of the bus traffic. However, the overall trip distribution for the study project remains the same as
under Existing Plus Project and Background Plus Project conditions.

Traffic Circulation:

Vehicle Circulation:
Only one study intersection (Intersection No. 1 - River Drive-Southbound US 101 Ramps) would
operate at or better than its level of service standard.

The project would contribute to significant cumulative impacts at the following study
intersections:
    2. Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street
    3. First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps

                                                                                          PAGE VIII
   4.   First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps
   5.   First Street / Lonoak Road
   6.   First Street / Broadway Street
   7.   Metz Road / Bitterwater Road
   8.   Metz Road / San Antonio Drive
   9.   San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road

See Exhibit ES-1 for the recommended improvements at these intersections. Implementation of
these improvement would reduce the level of Cumulative plus Project impacts at each
intersection to less-than-significant.

The project would be responsible for a fair-share contribution towards the cost of implementing
these improvements, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to each individual
intersection. This would constitute its fair share of Cumulative plus Project mitigations. A
credit is given for the project facilitating enhanced transit service in the King City area.

Pedestrian Circulation:
No significant cumulative impacts, as the project’s distance away from residential neighborhoods
and commercial areas in the city would be greater than typical walking distances to and from the
project site.

Bicycle Circulation:
No significant cumulative impacts, as it is not anticipated that the planned bicycle improvements
along First Street would, by itself, increase bicycle travel to and from the project site.

Transit Circulation:
No significant cumulative impacts, as although MST may establish transit service to the
immediate project vicinity, it is speculative to identify the potential increase in transit usage and
the proximity of potential future bus stops to the project site.

Railroad Circulation:
No significant cumulative impacts. Although the City of King is exploring the possibility of re-
establishing an Amtrak station in the city, few, if any, people would use such a station to access
the project site, due to the distance between the potential station and the project site and the
current Amtrak schedule. In addition, the combination of the existing railroad crossing gates and
future signalization of the intersections near the current and future railroad at-grade crossings
would adequately control traffic near said crossings and minimize the potential for vehicles to be
queued up on the tracks at the time of a passing train.

Site Access and Internal Circulation:

The project site plan is currently in development. The site plan included in this report is
schematic and only intended to illustrate the project size and site plan elements. Driveway
locations, numbers and locations of parking spaces and locations of pedestrian facilities are
currently being determined. A sidewalk will be provided along the project’s public street
frontages. A site plan review will be conducted when a finalized site plan is available.
                                                                                            PAGE IX
Construction Impacts:

The large, flat site and relatively small building will result in low amounts of earthwork and
general construction. Low traffic volumes are carried by the nearby street system. Together, the
project will have an insignificant construction traffic impact. No mitigation is recommended.

Summary of Project Responsibilities:

The project will not create any significant impacts. The project therefore has no responsibility to
implement or contribute to off-site mitigations for project or cumulative impacts.

INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the potential traffic circulation issues associated with the proposed
MST South County Maintenance and Operations facility in King City, California. Vehicular,
pedestrian, bicycle and transit circulation issues were evaluated at the project site and the
surrounding street network in King City, along with assessment of site access and on-site
circulation. The project site is located on San Antonio Drive at Don Bates Way, inside the
East Ranch Business Park. The location of the project site is indicated on Exhibit 1.

The conceptual site plan is shown on Exhibit 2. The site plan included in this report is
schematic and only intended to illustrate the project size and site plan elements. Driveway
locations, numbers and locations of parking spaces and locations of internal pedestrian
facilities are currently being determined. A site plan review will be conducted when a
finalized site plan is available.


       Scope of Work
       This report addresses the following topics:
           Existing vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle circulation at the project access and
              the surrounding street network.
           Assessment of potential direct impacts to vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, transit
              and rail circulation due to the project, and recommendations to minimize or
              alleviate those impacts.
           Assessment of potential cumulative traffic impacts.
           Site access and on-site circulation assessment.

       Study Network
       The AM and PM peak periods were analyzed at the following intersections:
          1. River Drive – Southbound US 101 Ramps / Broadway Circle
          2. Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street
          3. First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps
          4. First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps
          5. First Street / Lonoak Road
          6. Firs Street / Broadway Street
          7. Metz Road / Bitterwater Road
          8. Metz Road / San Antonio Drive
          9. San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road

       Exhibit 3 shows the existing traffic control and lane configurations at the study
       intersections.

       Traffic operations for the following analysis scenarios were analyzed:
           Existing Conditions
           Existing Plus Project Conditions


12
           Background Conditions
           Background Plus Project Conditions
           Cumulative Without Project Conditions
           Cumulative Plus Project Conditions

     Improvements recommended to mitigate impacts under each development scenario are
     recommended where warranted.

     Traffic Operation Evaluation Methodologies
     Intersection traffic operations were evaluated based upon the level of service (LOS)
     concept. LOS is a qualitative description of an intersection’s operations, ranging from
     LOS A to LOS F. Level of Service “A” represents free flow uncongested traffic
     conditions. Level of Service “F” represents highly congested traffic conditions with
     unacceptable delay to vehicles at intersections. The intermediate levels of service
     represent incremental levels of congestion and delay between these two extremes. The
     analysis was performed using the 2000 and 2010 Highway Capacity Manual
     methodologies. LOS descriptions for each type of existing traffic control at the study
     intersections (i.e., signal, all-way stop and one-/two-way stop) are included as
     Appendix A.

     Level of Service Standards
     The study area includes intersections under the jurisdictions of the City of King and
     Caltrans. The City of King has an overall level of service (LOS) standard of LOS C,
     which applies to Intersections #2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The Caltrans’ overall level of
     service standard is generally the transition from LOS C to LOS D (abbreviated as LOS
     C/D in this document), which applies to Intersections #1, 3, and 4.

     Significance Criteria
     According to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines, a project
     may have a significant effect on the environment if it would cause an increase in traffic
     that is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and capacity of the street
     system. The following significance criteria has been used within this study, based
     upon the jurisdiction of each study intersection:

     City of King
     The City of King does not have established, specific impact criteria for transportation-
     related impacts. Therefore, the following significance criteria have been used in this
     study:

     Signalized Intersection (Intersection #2)
     A significant impact at a signalized study intersection is defined to occur under either
     of the following two conditions:
            If an intersection currently operating at LOS A, B, or C degrades to D, E or F;
             or

13
           For intersections already operating at unacceptable levels D, E or F, if the
            project would cause overall delay to increase by at least 0.1 seconds.

     All-Way Stop-Controlled Intersection (Intersection #6)
     A significant impact at an all-way stop-controlled study intersection is defined to
     occur under either of the following two conditions:
           If an intersection operating at LOS A, B, or C degrades to D, E or F; or
           For intersections already operating at unacceptable levels D, E or F, if the
            project would cause overall delay to increase by at least 0.1 seconds.

     One- or Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersection (Intersections #5, 7, 8 and 9)
     A significant impact at a one- or two-way stop-controlled study intersection is
     defined to occur under either of the following two conditions:
           If any traffic movement operating at LOS A, B, C, D or E degrades to F; or
           For traffic movements already operating at unacceptable level F if the project
            would cause overall delay to increase by at least 0.1 seconds.

     Caltrans
     The following significance criteria have been used within this study at intersections
     under the jurisdiction of Caltrans:

     All-Way Stop-Controlled Intersection (Intersection #1)
     A significant impact at an all-way stop-controlled study intersection is defined to
     occur under either of the following two conditions:
           If an intersection operating at LOS A, B, or C degrades to D, E or F; or
           For intersections already operating at unacceptable levels D, E or F if the
            project would cause overall delay to increase by at least 0.1 seconds.

     One- or Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersection (Intersections #3, 4)
     A significant impact at a one- or two-way stop-controlled study intersection is
     defined to occur under either of the following two conditions:
           If any traffic movement operating at LOS A, B, C, D or E degrades to F; or
           For intersections already operating at unacceptable level F if the project would
            cause overall delay to increase by at least 0.1 seconds.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
This chapter of the report evaluates Existing traffic conditions and includes a description of
the project setting.

       Existing Traffic Network
       The project site is located at the northwest corner of the San Antonio Drive and Don
       Bates Way intersection in the East Ranch Business Park in northeastern King City.
       Regional access to the project site is provided by US 101. Major roadways in the
       vicinity of the project site include San Antonio Drive, Metz Road, Bitterwater Road,
       First Street and Broadway Street. Other roadways serving the study area include
       Lonoak Road, Broadway Circle, and River Drive. A brief description of each roadway
       can be found below.

       US 101 is a four-lane freeway providing statewide and regional circulation functions.
       In Monterey County, US 101 traverses the Salinas Valley north to Salinas and
       eventually San Jose and the San Francisco Bay Area, and south into San Luis Obispo
       County towards Los Angeles. Through King City, US 101 is in an east-west
       alignment, although its regional alignment is in a north-south orientation. Interchanges
       within King City are located at Broadway Street, Canal Street, and First Street. The
       speed limit on US 101 is 65 miles per hour (mph) north of First Street, and 70 mph
       south of First Street.

       Bitterwater Road is a two-lane, east-west arterial street in northeastern King City.
       Bitterwater Road connects First Street and Metz Road via an at-grade railroad crossing,
       then continues eastward through the industrial portion of the city. East of King City,
       Bitterwater Road continues in a northeasterly direction to State Route 25 (SR 25) in
       San Benito County, and is designated as County Route G13. The speed limit on
       Bitterwater Road is 25 mph between First Street and a point 50 feet east of Metz Road,
       35 mph between a point 50 feet east of Metz Road and Airport Drive, and 45 mph east
       of Airport Drive, including in Monterey County immediately east of King City.

       Broadway Circle is a two-lane local street in southern King City. Broadway Circle is
       an extension of San Antonio Drive south of Broadway Street, and provides access to
       the US 101/Broadway Street interchange, as well as to commercial development south
       of US 101. The speed limit on Broadway Circle is 25 mph.

       Broadway Street is a two-lane, east-west arterial street through the center of King
       City, connecting the eastern and western portions of the city. The central business
       district of King City is centered around the eastern end of Broadway Street. The speed
       limit on Broadway Street is 25 mph.




15
     First Street is a two-lane, north-south arterial street in eastern King City, with left turn
     channelization in the downtown area. First Street extends from Bitterwater Road north
     of the downtown area to US 101 at its southern terminus. First Street is also
     designated as County Route G15. The speed limit on First Street is 25 mph north of
     Division Street, 35 mph between Division Street and Lonoak Road, and 45 mph south
     of Lonoak Road.

     Lonoak Road is a two-lane, east-west roadway on the southeastern edge of King City.
     This roadway serves the local agricultural fields and homes east of King City, and
     extends eastward to SR 25 near the Monterey-San Benito County Line. In the vicinity
     of King City, Lonoak Road is classified as a collector street, and has a posted speed
     limit of 25 mph. East of King City, there is no posted speed limit; for the purposes of
     this analysis, it is assumed that the speed limit is 55 mph in this section.

     Metz Road is a two-lane, north-south arterial roadway within Monterey County and
     King City. Metz Road extends northward from King City along the eastern edge of the
     Salinas Valley to SR 146 just east of Soledad. Metz Road is also designated as County
     Route G15. South of Airport Drive, the speed limit on Metz Road is 35 mph. North of
     Airport Drive, there is no posted speed limit; for the purposes of this analysis, it is
     assumed that the speed limit is 55 mph in this section.

     River Drive is a two-lane, east-west local street within southern King City, serving a
     residential neighborhood (“Forden” Neighborhood) south of US 101. The speed limit
     on River Drive is 25 mph.

     San Antonio Drive is an arterial street within King City. San Antonio Drive forms a
     loop around the western and northern portions of the city, through residential areas in
     the north and west and industrial areas to the northeast. San Antonio Drive is four
     lanes wide between Broadway Street and just north of Bedford Avenue, and is two
     lanes wide for the remainder of the street. A center median is present on San Antonio
     Drive between Mildred Avenue and just east of Third Street. The speed limit on San
     Antonio Drive is 35 mph, except between Willow Street Metz Road, where it is signed
     at 25 mph.

     Existing Pedestrian Network
     Sidewalks are present along most developed properties on San Antonio Drive near the
     project site (i.e., between Metz Road and Bitterwater Drive) – there are continuous
     sidewalks along the southern and western sides of the street, but only two short and
     discontinuous sections of sidewalk on the northern and eastern sides. Although there
     are connecting sidewalks along the eastern side of Metz Road and the northern side of
     Bitterwater Road, there is no clear pedestrian route across the at-grade railroad
     crossings at either Bitterwater Road or San Antonio Drive. A connecting sidewalk is
     present just west (i.e., non-project site) of the railroad crossing on the southern side of



16
     San Antonio Drive, but there is no sidewalk present on either side of Bitterwater Road
     west of its railroad crossing.

     Existing Bicycle Network
     There are no existing bicycle facilities near the project site. The nearest facilities are
     bicycle lanes in both directions of San Antonio Drive between Mildred Avenue and
     Third Street, over a half-mile west of the project site. However, the shoulders on most
     roadways in the city are sufficiently wide to allow bicyclists to travel alongside
     vehicles.

     Existing Transit Service
     Monterey-Salinas Transit provides indirect fixed-route transit service to the study
     project site. Routes 23, 82, 83, 84, and 86 all stop in King City, but only at select
     locations.
          Route 23 connects the communities of the Salinas Valley to Salinas itself.
             Service is provided hourly on weekdays and weekends. In King City itself,
             Route 23 traverses a clockwise loop around the city. Although Route 23 stops
             in multiple places in King City, the nearest bus stops are located on eastbound
             San Antonio Drive near Bishop Street and on eastbound Broadway Street near
             Second Street – both locations are a 20- to 30-minute walk from the project
             site.
          Route 82 is an express route that connects Fort Hunter Liggett (located south of
             King City) to Salinas and Seaside, via King City. This route is only in
             operation five times on weekdays (three times northbound and two times
             southbound) and two times on weekends (one time northbound and one time
             southbound). Although this route also traverses a clockwise loop around King
             City, it does not stop at as many locations in the city as Route 23. The nearest
             bus stop for Route 82 to the project site is on First Street at Pearl Street, a 30-
             minute walk from the project site.
          Route 84 connects Soledad and Paso Robles (in San Luis Obispo County) via
             King City. Although the route connects to other destinations on its route more
             frequently, it only services King City eight times a day on weekdays (four
             times northbound and four times southbound) and two days on weekends (two
             times northbound and two times southbound). The nearest bus stop for Route
             84 to the project site is also on First Street at Pearl Street.
          Route 86 connects King City to San Jose via Salinas, Norman Y. Mineta San
             Jose International Airport, downtown San Jose and Diridon Station. Service for
             this route is only one round trip on weekdays and two round trips on weekends.
             In addition, this route also directly connects King City and the intersection of
             State Routes 68 and 218 in Monterey during one round trip on weekdays and
             two round trips on weekends. The nearest bus stop for Route 86 to the project
             site is also on First Street at Pearl Street.




17
     MST also provides dial-a-ride service via its MST On Call South County program. In
     King City, the service provides rides to and from any destination within the city and in
     the unincorporated Pine Canyon Road residential area southwest of the city on
     weekdays between 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM.

     Existing Railroad Service
     Regionally, the Union Pacific Railroad rail line is the primary north-south rail route
     along the Pacific coast, connecting to Los Angeles to the south, and Oakland,
     Sacramento, and Portland to the north. This rail line, which is comprised of two rail
     tracks (or “dual tracking”) throughout much of the city, is located in the eastern portion
     of King City. South of the city, it is parallel to and north of Highway 101, then east of
     First Street. North of the King City central business district, the rail line parallels Metz

     Road to the west, which it follows as it exits the city to the north. At-grade rail
     crossings in the greater King City area include Lonoak Road, Bitterwater Road, San
     Antonio Drive, and Spreckels Road.

     Amtrak, the national passenger rail service company, provides passenger service in the
     King City area via the Coast Starlight service. The Coast Starlight is composed of one
     northbound and one southbound passenger train per day. Approximately 8 to12 freight
     trains also pass through the King City area each day.

     Existing Conditions Traffic Circulation

     Vehicle Circulation

     Intersection turning movement counts were conducted at the study intersections during
     the AM (7:00 – 9:00 AM) and PM (4:00 – 6:00) peak hours on Thursday, April 27,
     2017. Traffic data was collected for cars, trucks, buses, bicyclists, and pedestrians.
     From these counts, the AM and PM peak hour volumes were derived. Appendix B
     contains the traffic count data at the study intersections.

     Exhibit 3 indicates existing lane configurations at study intersections. Exhibit 4
     depicts the existing peak turning movement volumes for the study intersections.

     Existing intersection levels of service are summarized on Exhibit 5a.            The LOS
     calculation sheets for Existing conditions can be found in Appendix C.

     All of the study intersections currently operate at or better than their respective level of
     service standards. No improvements are recommended for existing conditions, as
     summarized on Exhibit 5b.




18
     Pedestrian Circulation
     There is little to no pedestrian traffic at the study intersections, with most pedestrian
     traffic located near the commercial areas off Broadway Circle and on First Street at
     Broadway Street.

     Bicycle Circulation
     There is little to no bicycle traffic at the study intersections, with most bicycle traffic
     located on Broadway Circle and First Street.




19
EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
     Project Description
     The study project is an approximately 14,000 square foot maintenance and operations
     facility on a 4.8 acre site for Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) to support southern
     Monterey County operations. The project consists of a three-bay maintenance area, an
     administrative area (including offices, bus driver break area, and dispatch area) and
     equipment storage area. Up to 40 buses and 45 employees (including bus drivers)
     would be based out of this facility.

     Project Trip Generation
     A custom trip generation estimate has been prepared for this project, based upon
     information provided by MST and various assumptions regarding anticipated operation
     of the facility.

     There would be five types of trip generators at the project site:
            1. Buses and Shuttles – The active fleet standard-size buses, shuttles and
               paratransit vehicles would be stored and maintained at the facility. Spare
               buses and shuttles would also be stored at the facility but would only be in
               use as needed (e.g., if an active fleet bus was temporarily unusable).
            2. Staff – Staffing at the site includes bus drivers, fleet maintenance staff and
               operational supervisors. While the bus drivers and operational supervisors
               would typically be in the field during their working hours, the maintenance
               staff would spend their work hours on site.
            3. Relief Units – These vehicles would allow transportation to offsite locations
               for transfers of buses between bus drivers beginning and ending their
               respective shifts without having to return the bus to the facility.
            4. Deliveries – There would be two types of deliveries to the site – fuel
               deliveries (to fuel buses and other vehicles) and non-fuel deliveries (e.g.,
               US Mail and package deliveries).
            5. Visitors – Visitors would include employees from other MST facilities and
               other non-employees visiting the facility.

     Appendix D contains a comprehensive list of data and assumptions used in the
     derivation of the project trip generation estimate. However, the following is a list of
     key data and assumptions:

            1. Maximum Total Staffing: 45 staff (including bus drivers)
            2. Maximum Total Buses and Shuttles: 40 (including 5 spare buses)
            3. All staff (including bus drivers) are assumed to drive themselves to and
               from the site.




20
            4. Due to their respective schedules, virtually all of the bus drivers, fleet
               maintenance staff, and buses and shuttles would be traveling to and from
               the site outside of the AM and PM peak hours.
            5. Fifty (50%) of on-site staff are assumed to travel offsite during their
               respective lunch hours.
            6. There would be one (1) fuel delivery per week to the site. To be
               conservative, this fuel delivery was included in the trip generation estimate
               for the project.
            7. There would be 10 deliveries per day to the site, spread out throughout the
               day.
            8. There would be 3 visitors to the site per day.

     Exhibit 6 summarizes the project trip activity. The project is estimated to generate
     263 daily trips, with 4 trips (2 in, 2 out) during the AM peak hour and 4 trips (2 in,
     2 out) during the PM peak hour.

     The project is also a unique land use in that it supports the development and operation
     of a transit system that will reduce overall traffic volumes throughout the study area.
     Recent studies indicate that MST transit operations currently have about a 0.5% mode
     share. In other words, the introduction of enhanced transit service in King City that
     will be able to occur due to the South County Operations and Maintenance Facility will
     reduce traffic on the arterial street system by about 0.5%. This is not accounted for in
     the traffic operations analysis. However, the 0.5% traffic reduction will be credited
     toward the project’s contribution to mitigations identified in this analysis.

     Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
     Exhibit 7 depicts the trip distribution for the project. This distribution was derived
     based upon MST routes in southern Monterey County and major population centers in
     King City and the greater area. A total of adjacent complementary uses in the greater
     study area and travel patterns indicated by the existing intersection traffic counts. A
     total of 18% of the total trips were distributed in King City itself, as it is anticipated
     that some of the employees will either move to or are currently living in King City.

     The trip distribution was combined with the trip generation to derive the project trip
     assignment, both of which are depicted on Exhibit 7. The trip assignment was added
     to the existing traffic volumes to estimate the Existing Plus Project volumes depicted
     on Exhibit 8.

     Existing Plus Project Condition Traffic Circulation

     Vehicle Circulation
     Existing Plus Project condition intersection levels of service are summarized on
     Exhibit 5. The LOS calculation sheets for Existing Plus Project conditions can be
     found in Appendix E.


21
     All of the study intersections would continue to operate at or better than their
     respective levels of service standards under Existing Plus Project Conditions. No
     improvements are required.

     There will be no project-specific significant impacts, even without credit for reductions
     in overall ambient traffic on the King City street system due to the expanded transit
     service the project will facilitate.

     Pedestrian Circulation
     The project is anticipated to generate little pedestrian traffic, due to the distance of the
     project site from the residential neighborhoods of King City and the lack of pedestrian
     facilities connecting the project site to said neighborhoods. Therefore, the project
     would not represent a significant impact to pedestrian circulation.  The final design plan
     will include a sidewalk along its San Antonio Drive and Don Bates Way frontages.

     Bicycle Circulation
     The project is anticipated to generate little bicycle traffic, again due to the distance of
     the project site from the residential neighborhoods of King City and the lack of bicycle
     facilities connecting the project site to said neighborhoods. Therefore, the project
     would not represent a significant impact to bicycle circulation.

     Transit Circulation
     The project is anticipated to generate little, if any, increase in transit usage by
     employees or visitors to the project site, due to the distance of the project site from any
     bus stops and the relative infrequency of transit service to the King City area.
     Therefore, the project would not represent a significant impact to transit use.

     Railroad Circulation
     As trains do not currently stop in or near King City, the project would not generate any
     new railroad passenger use (e.g., Amtrak).

     The at-grade rail crossings at both Bitterwater Road and San Antonio Drive have
     existing crossing gates that are activated when trains approach the respective crossings.
     Although Intersection 7 – Metz Road / Bitterwater Road – and Intersection 8 – Metz
     Road / San Antonio Drive – are located immediately adjacent to the at-grade rail
     crossings, stop signs are currently on Metz Road at both intersections; therefore,
     project traffic crossing the railroad tracks would not be stopped on the tracks for
     extended periods behind a stop sign, awaiting gaps in conflicting traffic before clearing
     the tracks.

     The project will have multiple transit buses to and from the project site during normal
     operations. Although buses carrying passengers must stop at all at-grade rail crossings,
     all of the buses traveling to and from the project site will be out of service (or


22
     “deadhead”), and thus would not be carrying any passengers. Out of service buses are
     not required to stop at rail crossings, therefore the number of vehicles stopping at the
     Bitterwater Road at-grade rail crossing would not increase over current conditions,with
     the exception of increased transit service on existing or expanded routes.

     Accounting for all of this, the study project would not impact railroad passenger
     service, add additional traffic that would be stopped on the railroad tracks for extensive
     periods of time or cause significant congestion at the Bitterwater Road at-grade rail
     crossing.

     TAMC Regional Development Impact Fee
     The Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC) assesses a regional
     development impact fee that funds various countywide transportation projects. This
     project is a local public agency project (i.e., owned and operated by Monterey-Salinas
     Transit), and is not subject to this fee.




23
BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
This chapter describes Background Conditions, which includes estimated traffic conditions
from approved projects in King City. This scenario does not include trips from the study
project.

       Background Traffic Volumes
       Various approved but yet not constructed/completed projects are located in King City,
       including near the project site. A list of these projects was obtained from the City of
       King, which are located throughout King City. Exhibit 9 summarizes their trip
       generation. The trips from these projects were distributed through the study
       intersections and added to the Existing traffic volumes to create the Background
       conditions traffic volumes depicted in Exhibit 10.

       Background Condition Traffic Circulation
       Background condition intersection levels of service are summarized on Exhibit 5. The
       LOS calculation sheets for Background conditions can be found in Appendix F.

       Most of the study intersections will continue to operate at or better than their respective
       levels of service standards under Background Conditions. However, one intersection
       will operate just below its level of service standard: Intersection No. 6 - First Street /
       Broadway Street – LOS D near C (PM), although it will remain at an acceptable LOS
       C during the AM peak hour. The Caltrans peak hour signal warrant will be met at this
       intersection (see Appendix J).
       The Downtown Addition, which is a long-term mixed-use development on the east side
       of the existing downtown and railroad tracks, is also an approved project, but has an
       implementation schedule longer than other Background projects. At the direction of
       the City Planning Department, it is not included until the Cumulative scenario. The
       Downtown Addition is responsible for paying for this signal, as well as other
       improvements at this intersection. The Background mitigation at this intersection is
       therefore anticipated to be fully funded.




24
BACKGROUND PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
This chapter provides a description of the analysis under Background Plus Project traffic
conditions, which analyzes Background Conditions plus anticipated traffic from the proposed
project.

       Background Plus Project Traffic Volumes
       The project trip assignment (Exhibit 7) was added to the Background Condition
       volumes (Exhibit 10) to create Background Plus Project Condition volumes shown in
       Exhibit 11.

       Background Plus Project Conditions Traffic Circulation

       Vehicle Circulation
       Background Plus Project intersection levels of service are summarized on Exhibit 5.
       The LOS calculation sheets for Background Plus Project traffic conditions can be
       found in Appendix G.

       Although most of the study intersections would continue operate at or better than their
       respective level of service standards under Background Plus Project conditions, :
       Intersection No. 6 - First Street / Broadway Street – LOS D (PM), acceptable LOS C
       (AM)  would continue to operate below its level of service standard, although there will
       be virtually no increase in delay or congestion due to the project. The average delay
       for both the morning and evening peak hours will not change due to traffic from the
       Project.

       Below is a discussion of the significance evaluations and recommended improvements
       at the study intersection operating under deficient operations under Background Plus
       Project conditions.

             Intersection #6 – First Street / Broadway Street:
              A traffic signal will be warranted at this intersection with the traffic associated
              with Background traffic (see Appendix J). As described under the Existing
              Plus Background scenario, the traffic signal and other longer-term
              improvements at this intersection will be implemented by the Downtown
              Addition. The Project has no financial responsibility for mitigations for
              Background (or Cumulative, which is the scenario that includes the Downtown
              Addition) mitigations.


       Pedestrian Circulation
       Pedestrian traffic under Background Plus Project conditions is not anticipated to
       significantly increase over Existing Plus Project conditions. Therefore, the project

25
     would not represent a significant impact to pedestrian circulation under Background
     Plus Project conditions. The Project will include a sidewalk along its San Antonio
     Drive and Don Bates Way frontages.

     Bicycle Circulation
     Bicycle traffic under Background Plus Project conditions is not anticipated to
     significantly increase over Existing Plus Project conditions. Therefore, the project
     would not represent a significant impact to bicycle circulation under Background Plus
     Project conditions.

CUMULATIVE WITHOUT PROJECT CONDITIONS
This section describes Cumulative conditions without the study project. The Cumulative
Without Project traffic condition is defined as buildout of the current City of King General
Plan, or traffic conditions a minimum of thirteen years beyond existing conditions (i.e., the
Year 2030). This analysis scenario does not include traffic from the study project.

       Derivation of Cumulative Without Project Condition Traffic Volumes
       The traffic volumes under the Cumulative Without Project condition are based upon
       traffic forecasts in First Street Bypass Traffic Impact Analysis, Higgins Associates,
       June 12, 2009. These forecasts incorporate buildout of properties governed by the City
       of King General Plan, including buildout of the East Ranch Business Park, the
       industrial area along Industrial Way (off Bitterwater Road east of San Antonio Drive),
       the Downtown Addition mixed-use project (an Approved project) and the Creekbridge
       residential project north of San Antonio Drive.

       Exhibit 12 illustrates the Cumulative Without Project traffic volumes at the study
       intersections.

       Modifications to Study Area Street Network
       Both Cumulative Without Project and Cumulative Plus Project scenarios include two
       important modifications to the study area street network: 1) Broadway Street
       extension and 2) First Street Bypass. Both of these improvements will be implemented
       by the Downtown Addition. Each new roadway is briefly discussed below.

       The Broadway Street extension extends Broadway Street eastward of First Street,
       across the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and into the Downtown Addition project.

       The First Street Bypass is a truck and vehicle bypass road east of Downtown King
       City, extending from the San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road intersection to Lonoak
       Road. The portion of the bypass adjacent to the Downtown Addition project would be
       named “Oak Avenue”.

       The alignments for the Broadway Street extension and First Street Bypass are shown in
       Exhibit 12. The alignment of the First Street Bypass south of San Lorenzo Creek is
       illustrative, as the exact alignment of the roadway not been determined.




       Cumulative Without Project Traffic Circulation




27
     Vehicle Circulation
     Cumulative Without Project AM and PM intersection levels of service are summarized
     on Exhibit 5. The LOS calculation sheets for Cumulative Without Project traffic
     conditions can be found in Appendix H.

     Only one of the study intersections (Intersection 1- River Drive-Southbound US 101
     Ramps) would continue operate at or better than its level of service standard under
     Cumulative Without Project conditions. The following intersections would operate
     below their respective standards. The intersection numbers follow the numbering
     system used throughout this report.
         2. Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street – LOS D (PM)
         3. First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps – Overall LOS F (AM and PM), Side-
            Street LOS F (AM and PM)
         4. First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps – Side-Street LOS F (PM)
         5. First Street / Lonoak Road – Overall LOS F (AM and PM), Side-Street LOS F
            (AM and PM)
         6. First Street / Broadway Street – LOS F (AM and PM)
         7. Metz Road / Bitterwater Road – Overall LOS E (AM) and LOS D (PM), Side-
            Street LOS F (AM and PM)
         8. Metz Road / San Antonio Drive – Overall LOS E (AM) and LOS F (PM), Side-
            Street LOS F (AM and PM)
         9. San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road – Overall LOS D (AM) and LOS F
            (PM), Side-Street LOS F (AM and PM)

     Below is a discussion of recommended improvements at the study intersection
     operating under deficient operations under Cumulative conditions.

           Intersection #2 – Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street:
            This intersection will operate at a deficient LOS D during the PM peak hour.
            The Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC) conducted an
            Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) at this intersection and identified two
            alternative mitigation measures.
            The first is to modify the Broadway/San Antonio Drive intersection by adding a
            second westbound left turn lane on Broadway Street with a second lane in the
            southbound direction on the south leg of San Antonio Drive. The left turn lane
            could either be added as a fourth lane on the westbound approach or by
            converting the existing eastbound through movement to an optional left/through
            lane. The signal could also be modified to include the existing northbound US
            101 Off-Ramp, which would be widened to two lanes. However, according to
            the TAMC study, this five-legged intersection would continue to operate at


28
         LOS D at General Plan Buildout. If it remains as a four legged signal with the
         northbound US 101 Off-Ramp controlled by a stop sign, the intersection would
         operate at LOS C.
         The second alternative is to construct a single lane roundabout, which would
         operate at LOS B. Refer to “Regional Roundabout Study – Utilizing Caltrans’
         Intersection Control Evaluation, Section 3: King City,” Kittleson & Associates,
         2015.


         The implementation of either of the above alternatives would fully mitigate
         Cumulative impacts.


        Intersection #3 – First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps:
         Both overall and side-street operations at this intersection will operate at a
         deficient LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours. The Caltrans peak hour
         signal warrant will be met at this intersection (see Appendix J). Thus, it is
         recommended that the following improvement be implemented at this
         intersection:
            1. Signalize intersection.
         This improvement would reduce overall delay during the AM and PM peak
         hour to an acceptable LOS C.  Therefore, this improvement would reduce the
         cumulative impact to less-than-significant.

        Intersection #4 – First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps:
         It is recommended that the following improvements be implemented at this
         intersection:
            1. Add a southbound First Street exclusive right turn lane.
            2. Add a northbound US 101 Off-Ramp free right turn lane into a second
               northbound First Street through lane departing from the intersection.

         These improvements would reduce side-street delay during the PM peak hour
         to an acceptable LOS C for the side street movements, therefore more than
         offsetting the incremental increase in delay caused by Cumulative impacts.
         Therefore, this improvement would reduce the cumulative impact to less-than-
         significant.

        Intersection #5 – First Street / Lonoak Road:




29
         Both overall and side-street operations at this intersection will operate at a
         deficient LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours. The Caltrans peak hour
         signal warrant will be met at this intersection (see Appendix J). Thus, it is
         recommended that the following improvements be implemented at this
         intersection:
            1. Signalize intersection.
            2. Add a northbound First Street exclusive right turn lane and a
               southbound First Street exclusive left turn lane.
            3. Widen and restripe westbound Lonoak Road as one exclusive left turn
               lane and one shared left/through/right lane.
            4. Add a second through lane to both northbound and southbound First
               Street.
            5. Add a northbound First Street right turn overlap signal phase.

         These improvements would reduce overall and side-street delay during the AM
         and PM peak hours to an acceptable LOS B.  Therefore, this improvement
         would reduce the cumulative impact to less-than-significant.


        Intersection #6 – First Street / Broadway Street:
         Broadway Street will be extended eastward from First Street, across the Union
         Pacific Railroad tracks as a part of the Downtown Addition project. This
         intersection will operate at a deficient LOS F during the AM and PM peak
         hours. The Caltrans peak hour signal warrant will be met at this intersection
         (see Appendix J). Thus, it is recommended that the following improvements
         be implemented at this intersection:
            1. Signalize intersection (warranted under Background conditions).
            2. Add southbound First Street exclusive left turn and right turn lanes and
               a northbound exclusive right turn lane.
            3. Restripe and reconstruct both eastbound and westbound Broadway
               Street as one exclusive left lane and one shared through/right lane.

         These improvements would reduce overall delay during the AM and PM peak
         hours to an acceptable LOS C. Therefore, this improvement would reduce the
         cumulative impact to less-than-significant.


        Intersection #7 – Metz Road / Bitterwater Road:
         Both overall and side-street operations at this intersection will operate at a
         deficient overall LOS E (AM) and LOS F (PM) and side-street LOS F (AM and


30
         PM). The Caltrans peak hour signal warrant will be met at this intersection (see
         Appendix J). Thus, it is recommended that the following improvements be
         implemented at this intersection:
            1. Signalize intersection.
            2. Add an eastbound Bitterwater exclusive left turn lane and westbound
               Bitterwater exclusive right turn lane.

         These improvements would reduce overall delay during the AM and PM peak
         hours to an acceptable LOS C. Therefore, this improvement would reduce the
         cumulative impact to less-than-significant.


        Intersection #8 – Metz Road/ San Antonio Drive:
         Overall and side-street operations at this intersection will operate at a deficient
         overall LOS E (AM) and LOS F (PM) and side-street LOS F (AM and PM).
         The Caltrans peak hour signal warrant will be met at this intersection (see
         Appendix J). Thus, it is recommended that the following improvements be
         implemented at this intersection:
            1. Signalize intersection.
            2. Add an eastbound San Antonio exclusive right turn lane.

         These improvements would reduce overall delay during the AM and PM peak
         hours to an acceptable LOS C. Therefore, this improvement would reduce the
         level of the project’s impact to less-than-significant.


        Intersection #9 – San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road:
         Overall and side-street operations at this intersection would operate at a
         deficient overall LOS E during the PM peak hour and side-street LOS F during
         the AM and PM peak hours. The addition of project trips would increase delay
         by more than 0.1 seconds during the PM peak hour. Per the significance
         criteria in Section 1.5 of this document, the project would represent a
         significant impact at this intersection.


         The Caltrans peak hour signal warrant will be met at this intersection (see
         Appendix J). Thus, it is recommended that the following improvements be
         implemented at this intersection:
            1. Signalize intersection.




31
                2. Add northbound Oak Avenue exclusive right turn lane and westbound
                   Bitterwater exclusive left turn lane.
                3. Restripe southbound San Antonio as one shared left-through lane and
                   one exclusive right turn lane.

            These improvements would reduce overall delay to an acceptable LOS C under
            Cumulative Without Project conditions, therefore more than offsetting the
            incremental increase in delay caused by the project. Therefore, this
            improvement would reduce the cumulative impact to less-than-significant.

     Pedestrian Circulation
     There are no planned pedestrian network improvements in the vicinity of the project
     site.

     Bicycle Circulation
     The City of King is planning to add bicycle lanes on First Street from US 101 to
     Bitterwater Road and on Lonoak Road from First Street to the city limits. There are no
     additional planned bicycle network improvements in the vicinity of the project site.




32
CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
This section describes the analysis results under Cumulative Plus Project traffic conditions,
which combines both Cumulative Without Project conditions with traffic from the study
project.

       Derivation of Cumulative Plus Project Condition Traffic Volumes
       Cumulative Plus Project traffic volumes represent future project conditions plus the
       study project traffic.

       The project trip assignment under Cumulative Plus Project conditions has been revised
       due to the inclusion of the First Street Bypass into the area street network.
       Approximately 80% of the project traffic on First Street north of US 101 has been
       reassigned onto the Bypass, including all of the bus traffic. Exhibit 13 indicates the
       project trip assignment under Cumulative Plus Project conditions. Although the
       project trip distribution has been revised under Cumulative Plus Project conditions, the
       overall trip distribution for the study project remains the same as under Existing Plus
       Project and Background Plus Project conditions.

       The revised study project trip assignment (Exhibit 13) was added to the Cumulative
       Without Project condition volumes (Exhibit 12) to estimate the Cumulative Plus
       Project volumes in Exhibit 14.

       Cumulative Plus Project Traffic Conditions

       Vehicle Circulation
       Cumulative Plus Project conditions AM and PM intersection levels of service are
       summarized on Exhibit 5a. The LOS calculation sheets for Cumulative Without
       Project traffic conditions can be found in Appendix I.

       The same eight study intersections would operate below their respective standards
       under Cumulative Plus Project conditions as under the Cumulative Without Project
       conditions. They are as follows:
          2. Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street – LOS D (PM)
          3. First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps – Overall LOS F (AM and PM), Side-
              Street LOS F (AM and PM)
          4. First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps – Side-Street LOS F (PM)
          5. First Street / Lonoak Road – Overall LOS F (AM and PM), Side-Street LOS F
              (AM and PM)
          6. First Street / Broadway Street – LOS F (AM and PM)
          7. Metz Road / Bitterwater Road – Overall LOS E (AM) and LOS D (PM), Side-
              Street LOS F (AM and PM)



33
        8. Metz Road / San Antonio Drive – Overall LOS E (AM) and LOS F (PM), Side-
           Street LOS F (AM and PM)
        9. San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road – Overall LOS D (AM) and LOS F
           (PM), Side-Street LOS F (AM and PM)

     The project will not result in any additional decline in Level of Service. A comparison
     of the anticipated delay under Cumulative with and without the project indicate that
     generally the project will represent an imperceptible increase in delay at any study
     intersection.

     The project’s incremental increase in delay will generally be offset by the reduction in
     city-wide traffic that will occur by the increased transit service that will be able to be
     facilitated by the project.       This was discussed in the Project Trip Generation
     subsection of the Existing Plus Project section of this report. The introduction of
     enhanced transit service in King City that will be able to occur due to the South County
     Operations and Maintenance Facility will reduce traffic on the arterial street system by
     about 0.5%. This is not accounted for in the traffic operations analysis. However, the
     0.5% traffic reduction is credited toward the project’s contribution to cumulative
     mitigations identified in this analysis.

     Below is a discussion of the significance evaluations of project impacts at the study
     intersections operating under deficient operations under Cumulative Plus Project
     conditions. A description of the improvements at each study intersection is provided in
     the Cumulative Without Project section of this report.   Exhibit 5b summarizes these
     improvements.    Exhibit 15 provides a tabular summary of the calculations used to
     determine the project’s financial responsibility for Cumulative Plus Project impacts.

     •       Intersection #2 – Broadway Circle – San Antonio Drive / Broadway Street:
     The project would be responsible for its fair-share contribution toward cumulative
     mitigations based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to this intersection -
     0.19% of the total cost of these improvements. With a credit of 0.50% for reduced
     cumulative traffic due to increased transit service, the project would have no financial
     responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project mitigation.

     •       Intersection #3 – First Street / Southbound US 101 Ramps:
     The project would be responsible for its fair-share contribution towards these
     improvements, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to this
     intersection – 0.15% of the total cost of these improvements. With a credit of 0.50%
     for reduced cumulative traffic due to increased transit service, the project would have
     no financial responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project mitigation.




34
     •       Intersection #4 – First Street / Northbound US 101 Ramps:
     The project would be responsible for its fair-share contribution towards these
     improvements, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to this
     intersection – 0.17% of the total cost of these improvements. With a credit of 0.50%
     for reduced traffic due to increased transit service, the project would have no financial
     responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project mitigation.

     •       Intersection #5 – First Street / Lonoak Road:
     The project would be responsible for its fair-share contribution towards these
     improvements, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to this
     intersection – 0.19% of the total cost of these improvements. With a credit of 0.50%
     for reduced cumulative traffic due to increased transit service, the project would have
     no financial responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project mitigation.

     •       Intersection #6 – First Street / Broadway Street:
     Under Background Plus Project conditions, the project’s fair-share contribution
     towards the signalization of the intersection was already addressed. Cumulative
     mitigations will be funded and implemented by the Downtown Addition. Therefore,
     the project would have no financial responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus
     Project mitigation.

     •       Intersection #7 – Metz Road / Bitterwater Road:
     The project will not add measurable traffic to this intersection during peak hours, so
     will have no financial responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project
     mitigation.

     •       Intersection #8 – Metz Road/ San Antonio Drive:
     The project would be responsible for its fair-share contribution towards these
     improvements, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to this
     intersection – 0.42% of the total cost of the improvements. With a credit of 0.50% for
     reduced traffic cumulative due to increased transit service, the project would have no
     financial responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project mitigation.

     •       Intersection #9 – San Antonio Drive / Bitterwater Road:
     The project would be responsible for its fair-share contribution towards these
     improvements, based upon the amount of traffic the project would add to this
     intersection – 0.20% of the total cost of the improvements. With a credit of 0.50% for
     reduced cumulative traffic due to increased transit service, the project would have no
     financial responsibility for Cumulative and Cumulative Plus Project mitigation.

     Pedestrian Circulation
     Although the pedestrian circulation network (including sidewalks) is likely to expand
     throughout the city as vacant parcels develop, the project site’s distance away from
     residential neighborhoods and commercial areas in the city would continue to


35
     discourage increases in pedestrian travel to and from the project site. Therefore, the
     project would not represent a significant cumulative impact to pedestrian circulation.

     Bicycle Circulation
     Although the planned bicycle improvements along First Street would improve bicycle
     access into the downtown area, it is not anticipated that this improvement alone would
     increase bicycle travel to and from the project site. Thus, the project would not
     represent a significant cumulative impact to bicycle circulation.

     Transit Circulation
     As the East Ranch Business Park builds out, there is the potential for MST to establish
     transit service to the immediate project vicinity. However, it is speculative at this time
     to identify the potential increase in transit usage that such service would create, not to
     mention the proximity of potential future bus stops to the project site. Thus, the project
     would not represent a significant cumulative impact to transit circulation. In fact, the
     project will be a mitigation for overall traffic impacts by providing extensive transit
     resources to the King City and South Salinas Valley area.

     Railroad Circulation
     The City of King is exploring the possibility of re-establishing an Amtrak station in the
     city, possibly on First Street south of Broadway Street. However, given the distance
     between the potential station and the project site and the current Amtrak schedule, few,
     if any, people would use such a station to access the project site. In addition, the
     combination of the existing railroad crossing gates and future signalization of the
     intersections near the current and future railroad at-grade crossings would adequately
     control traffic near said crossings and minimize the potential for vehicles to be queued
     up on the tracks at the time of a passing train. Therefore, the project would not
     represent a significant cumulative impact to railroad circulation.




36
SITE ACCESS AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION
       The project site plan is currently in development. The site plan included in this report
       is schematic and only intended to illustrate the project size and site plan elements.
       Driveway locations, numbers and locations of parking spaces and locations of
       pedestrian facilities are currently being determined. A site plan review will be
       conducted when a finalized site plan is available.


CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS
The project site is essentially level. It is expected that earthwork will be minimal and that cut
and fill will be balanced, resulting in no net import or export of earth. The earthwork
operation will take only several weeks and will not involve a hauling operation. In addition,
the site is large enough to provide on-site stockpiling of earthwork materials. Therefore,
earthwork operations will have an insignificant traffic impact.

Construction will also require delivery of miscellaneous concrete, steel, lumber, asphalt
concrete, portland cement concrete and landscaping materials after completion of the site
grading and earthwork operation and during construction of paved areas, underground utilities,
building and landscaping. It is assumed that construction will take about 12 months, or 240
work days. The project is the equivalent square footage of about six 2,300 square foot houses.
The site is large enough to provide a construction materials staging and stockpile area to store
materials efficiently on the site and minimize deliveries. In addition to an extensive amount of
street frontage, on-site construction parking greater than typical for construction projects of
this type will be able to be provided, minimizing shuttling of construction workers to and from
the site. The project will generate construction traffic volumes similar to several single-family
homes, which is not significant.

All streets and intersections currently operate well within acceptable congestion levels. San
Antonio Drive currently carries about 60 vehicles per hour during the morning and evening
peak hours. This is one vehicle per minute, which is a very low volume. No traffic conflicts
will occur for construction traffic entering or leaving the site. The project is located in an
industrial area with no land uses such as schools that are sensitive to construction traffic. The
project will have minimal construction impacts. Project construction impacts are therefore
determined to be insignificant. No mitigation is recommended.


SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESPONSIBILITIES
The project will not create any significant impacts. The project therefore has no responsibility
to implement or contribute to off-site mitigations for project or cumulative impacts.

Notes:
 1.      LOS Stnd. = Level of Service Standard.
 2.      XX (YY) = Overall (Side Street).
 3.      Analysis performed using 2000 and 2010 Highway Capacity Manual methodologies.
 4.      Overall level of service standard for the City of King is LOS C. Overall level of service standard for Caltrans is the transition between LOS C and LOS D (LOS C/D).
 5.      * = Delay exceeds ability for 2000/2010 HCM to quantify.
 6.      Worst approach level of service standard is generally LOS E. Level of service "F" is the level of service at which improvements would normally be required.
 7.      Above delays and levels of service are summarized from calculations in Appendices C and E through I.
 8.      Items in bold represent significant impacts.
