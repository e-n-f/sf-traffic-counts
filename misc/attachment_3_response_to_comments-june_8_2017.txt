SUBJECT:       Rocketship Redwood City Elementary School Project Initial Study/Mitigated
               Negative Declaration – Revised Response to Comments


In accordance with Section 15074 of the CEQA Guidelines, prior to approving a project, the decision-
making body of the lead agency shall consider the proposed environmental document together with
any comments received during the public review process. Although there is no legal requirement to
formally respond to comments on a proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) as there is for
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), this memorandum provides a response to the written and
verbal comments received on the Rocketship Redwood City Elementary School Project Draft Initial
Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) to aid the City of Redwood City and County of San
Mateo decision-makers in their review of the project.

The Draft IS/MND was available for public review and comment from September 30, 2016 to
November 1, 2016. A public hearing was also held before the City of Redwood City Planning
Commission on November 1, 2016, to receive comments on the IS/MND. Six comment letters were
received on the Draft IS/MND and verbal comments were also received at the public hearing. A
Response to Comments Memorandum was prepared as part of the Final IS/MND on February 28,
2017. An additional seven comment letters were also received after circulation of the February 28,
2017 Response to Comments Memorandum and prior to the April 4, 2017 Planning Commission
hearing scheduled to consider adoption of the Final IS/MND. The decision at that meeting was
continued to a future date. This memorandum replaces and supersedes the February 28, 2017
Response to Comments Memorandum. In addition, a total of nine letters in support of the project
were received during and after the public comment period and these letters are reproduced in this
memorandum.

In the following pages, the comments received both during and after the public comment period
and responses are enumerated to allow for cross-referencing of CEQA-related comments. The
enumerated comment letters and November 1, 2016 and April 4, 2017 Planning Commission
meeting minutes are included in this memorandum, each preceding their respective responses. As
noted above, CEQA does not require or provide guidance on responding to comments on MNDs;
therefore, this memorandum follows CEQA Guidelines Section 15088, applicable to responses to
comments on EIRs, which requires that agencies respond only to significant environmental issues
raised in connection with the project. Therefore, this document focuses primarily on responding to



                  2215 Fifth Street, Berkeley, California 94710   510.540.7331   www.lsa.net
comments that relate to the adequacy of the information and environmental analysis provided in
the IS/MND.

COMMENT LETTERS
This memorandum includes a reproduction of each comment letter received on the IS/MND. Each
comment letter and the Planning Commission meeting minutes are assigned a letter (A, B, C, etc.),
and individual comments within each letter and meeting minutes are numbered consecutively. For
instance, comment A-1 is the first numbered comment in Letter A.

The following comment letters on the IS/MND were submitted to the City during the public
comment period, in addition to verbal comments received by the Planning Commission on

Response A-1:                       The City of Redwood City (City) acknowledges its role as the Lead Agency
                                    responsible for overseeing implementation of the mitigation measures
                                    outlined in the IS/MND. Based on the significance criteria established by the
                                    City of Redwood City and the County of San Mateo for evaluation of impacts
                                    related to traffic and circulation, the proposed project would not cause a
                                    significant impact on any study intersections, including State highways and
                                    no mitigation measures are required to be implemented on facilities under
                                    the jurisdiction of Caltrans.

Response A-2:                       This comment is noted. The project applicant proposes to implement a
                                    Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program that will encourage
                                    students and employees to carpool, or use active modes of transportation
                                    such as biking or walking to get to and from school. Also refer to Response
                                    B-6.

Response A-3:                       Bicycle and pedestrian facilities within the vicinity of the project site are
                                    described and evaluated on pages 102 through 103 of the IS/MND. As
                                    discussed, the proposed project would not result in a significant impact
                                    related to the operation of these facilities or create a safety impact due to
                                    the anticipated increase in use of these facilities due to the proposed school
                                    use. Impacts related to pedestrian and bicycle facilities would be less than
                                    significant and no mitigation would be required.

Response B-1:                       This introductory comment is noted.

Response B-2:                       This comment, which generally states the commenter’s opinion that the
                                    IS/MND is flawed and inadequate and that preparation of an Environmental
                                    Impact Report (EIR) is required to satisfy the requirements of CEQA, is noted.

                                    The City, in consultation with the County, first prepared an Initial Study to
                                    determine if the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
                                    environment and to determine whether or not an MND or EIR would be the
                                    appropriate environmental document under CEQA. Based on the evaluation
                                    of all environmental issue topics in the Initial Study, the City determined
                                    that, in light of the whole record, the proposed project could have a
                                    significant effect on the environment but that measures agreed to by the
                                    applicant would avoid or mitigate the effects to a point where no significant
                                    effect on the environment would occur. The City also determined that there
                                    is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record that the project, as
                                    revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. Therefore, per
                                    CEQA Guidelines Section 15064(f)(2), the City prepared an MND.

                                    The IS/MND includes an evaluation of all environmental issue topics
                                    outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and identifies impacts of the project
                                    relative to established significance criteria. In some cases, compliance with
                                    established regulations would ensure that the appropriate standards would
                                    be followed and appropriate measures would be implemented consistent
                                    with best practices to ensure that an environmental impact would not result
                                    with either construction or operation of the project. In other cases, specific
                                    mitigation measures are recommended to ensure that impacts would not
                                    exceed the established threshold. The commenter does not specify which
                                    impacts the commenter believes to be significant even with compliance
                                    with established regulations or which mitigation measures are considered to
                                    be inadequate. In addition, consistent with CEQA Guidelines Section 15097
                                    the City has prepared a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
                                    (MMRP). The MMRP identifies each required mitigation measure, the
                                    schedule or timing for implementation, and the parties responsible for
                                    implementing and monitoring the required action. The MMRP is designed to
                                    ensure implementation of the mitigation measures identified in the IS/MND
                                    and would be adopted by the City’s Planning Commission as part of project
                                    approval. The project applicant would be required to implement the MMRP
                                    as a condition of project approval.

                                    It should be noted that the existence of public controversy over the
                                    environmental effects of a project does not in and of itself require the
                                    preparation of an EIR if there is no substantial evidence before the City that
                                    the project may have a significant effect on the environment. Substantial
                                    evidence must consist of facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon
                                    facts, and expert opinion supported by facts. The lead agency must be
                                    presented with a “fair argument” that the project may have a significant
                                    effect on the environment in order to require an EIR.

                                    Specific points raised by the commenter that relate to the adequacy of the
                                    IS/MND are responded to below. Based on all of the comments received on
                                    the IS/MND, including those responded to below and in other letters
                                    reproduced and responded to in this document, the City has determined
                                    that, with implementation of the recommended mitigation measures, the
                                    proposed project would not have a significant effect on the environment
                                    and that a fair argument that a significant effect would occur that has not
                                    already been identified and mitigated has not been presented, and
                                    therefore, the IS/MND satisfies the requirements of CEQA. Further, the
                                    IS/MND provides an adequate level of information to allow the decision-
                                    makers to consider the potential physical changes to the environment
                                    associated with the project and make a determination regarding project
                                    approval.

Response B-3:                       The previous use on the project site, classic car sales, was in operation when
                                    the Rocketship Redwood Academy at 860 Charter Street Traffic Study
                                    Report (traffic study) was initiated in 2014. 1 Because the existing traffic
                                    counts include the trips generated by the classic car sales use, the trips
                                    generated by this use were subtracted from the trips generated by the
                                    proposed school use to estimate the net new project trips added to the
                                    surrounding roadways. The classic car sales use did not generate any trips
                                    during the AM peak hour and generated only three trips during the PM peak
                                    hour. Thus, the traffic analysis results would be unchanged whether or not
                                    trip credits for the previous use are included, and the baseline for the traffic
                                    study is not “flawed.”

Response B-4:                       The comment is unclear as to how the traffic analysis understates the project
                                    impacts. To clarify, school staff are not expected to mitigate significant
                                    impacts associated with the project. As stated in the traffic study, the project
                                    is expected to have a less-than-significant impact on the roadway network.
                                    As occurs at other Rocketship school sites, staff will assist with student drop-
                                    off and pick-up operations in the on-site loading area. Staff will also monitor
                                    the inbound and outbound driveways to ensure compliance with the right-

                                                                                                                 12
                                    turn only restrictions during the peak periods before and after school. The
                                    project applicant will submit a traffic operations plan to the City that
                                    describes pick-up and drop-off procedures.

Response B-5:                       As stated on page 100 of the IS/MND, the queues associated with on-site
                                    drop-off and pick-up operations are expected to be contained on site and
                                    not extend onto Charter Street. Thus, driveways of nearby businesses would
                                    not be blocked.

Response B-6:                       As discussed on page 89 of the IS/MND, the analysis of intersection levels of
                                    service is based on intersection turning-movement counts conducted in
                                    2014 and 2015. Likewise, the project trip estimates are based on traffic
                                    counts at five other Rocketship charter elementary schools in San Jose.
                                    Hexagon staff observed the peak drop-off and pick-up periods at Rocketship
                                    Mateo Sheedy Elementary and Rocketship Si Se Puede Academy immedi-
                                    ately before and after school to quantify the maximum queue length, and
                                    the length of the student loading zone. These schools are comparable to the
                                    proposed Rocketship school in Redwood City since they are all charter
                                    schools without bus service serving the same grades. In addition, they all
                                    use on-site pick-up and drop-off with loading from two lanes. The maximum
                                    queues observed at the San Jose schools were adjusted to account for
                                    differences in enrollment and the length of the student loading zone to
                                    estimate the on-site queue storage needs for the proposed school in
                                    Redwood City.

                                    In addition, for comparison purposes, Hexagon conducted additional
                                    analysis related to project trip estimates. Hexagon re-calculated the
                                    projected trip generation for the proposed project using the elementary
                                    school trip rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
                                    Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition and compared these rates to the trip
                                    estimates used in the traffic study. The results show that trip generation at
                                    ITE rates would be lower (approximately 54 percent less) than the average
                                    rates observed at other Rocketship schools and used for the intersection
                                    level of service analysis in the traffic study and IS/MND. Therefore, the
                                    analysis in the IS/MND represents a conservative (high) estimate of
                                    corresponding intersection level of service analysis for study area intersec-
                                    tions. In either case, impacts to study area intersections would be less than
                                    significant. The results of this analysis are included in Appendix B of this
                                    Response to Comments Memorandum.

                                    Furthermore, it should be noted that the project applicant will implement a
                                    TDM Program as a condition of project approval. It is estimated that the
                                    specified measures may reduce the school’s AM peak-hour vehicle trips by
                                    approximately 30 percent, further reducing vehicle queues and intersection
                                    delay during this period. Again, no credits for implementation of the TDM
                                    Program were applied to the project’s trip generation included in the traffic

                                    study analysis; therefore, the analysis in the IS/MND represents a conserva-
                                    tive (high) estimate of corresponding intersection level of service analysis
                                    for study area intersections. Refer to Appendix B of this RTC Memorandum
                                    for more information on the proposed TDM Program.

Response B-7:                       Emergency access is discussed on page 101 of the IS/MND. Large fire trucks
                                    will be able to enter the main parking lot without any assistance from staff.
                                    During the peak hours before and after school, fire trucks will be able to
                                    enter from Charter Street and exit to Bay Road. During the mid-day hours,
                                    when the student recreation portion of the lot is gated, fire trucks would
                                    enter from Bay Street. Staff may assist fire trucks as they exit by clearing
                                    students from the playground area and opening the gates to allow the
                                    trucks to exit onto Charter Street. This is a task that will be familiar to staff
                                    as they will be responsible for clearing the playground on a daily basis
                                    before opening the gates to allow for vehicular circulation through the area
                                    for student pick-up each afternoon.

Response B-8:                       Cumulative conditions reflect a horizon year of 2020 and are discussed on
                                    page 94 of the IS/MND. Cumulative traffic volumes were estimated by
                                    applying a 1 percent growth factor per year and adding trips generated by
                                    all approved projects in the vicinity. The City provided a list of approved
                                    projects when the traffic study was undertaken. Cumulative conditions
                                    reflect the traffic associated with full buildout of the Stanford in Redwood
                                    City project. The parking lot mentioned in the comment has been recently
                                    approved for temporary use only, 2 and thus is not included in the
                                    cumulative scenario.

Response B-9:                       Parking is discussed in the traffic impact study for informational purposes
                                    only and is not addressed in the IS/MND because it is not a subject area
                                    covered by the CEQA legislation. The project meets the parking require-
                                    ments expressed in the City of Redwood City’s zoning code. The on-site
                                    parking (38 spaces) is more than sufficient to accommodate Rocketship
                                    employees (25 full time and 5 to 10 part time). In addition, the school’s TDM
                                    Program is expected to encourage school staff to carpool or use alternative
                                    modes of transportation such that not all employees will need a parking
                                    space (also refer to Response B-6). Thus, there will be a limited number of
                                    spaces available for parents volunteering or attending meetings at the
                                    school during the day. Although not required, the applicant is actively
                                    pursuing off-site parking locations for use by parents attending evening
                                    events at the school.

Response B-10:                      The air quality and greenhouse gas impact analysis was conducted properly
                                    using the analysis guidelines of the Bay Area Air Quality Management
                                    District (BAAQMD). The analysis utilized the California Emissions Estimator
                                    Model, which accounts for all trips generated by the project and includes
                                    idling emissions. The emissions from traffic generated by the project are
                                    based on trips estimated by the model. Emissions of criteria air pollutants
                                    are shown in Table 2 on page 31 of the IS/MND and indicate that air
                                    emissions would be well below the BAAQMD significance criteria for daily
                                    and annual emissions. Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions associated
                                    with the project are shown in Table 4 on page 47 of the IS/MND and
                                    indicate that greenhouse gas emissions would also be well below the
                                    significance threshold. See also Responses B-3 through B-6 regarding the
                                    traffic analysis.

Response B-11:                      As noted on page 72 of the IS/MND, project trips represent a small portion
                                    of the daily vehicle traffic on the surrounding roadways, therefore, the
                                    increase in daily trips associated with the project would not result in
                                    perceptible increase in traffic noise. As discussed above, traffic generation
                                    associated with the project was not underestimated, therefore traffic noise
                                    impacts associated with the project would remain less-than-significant.

Response B-12:                      As shown in Figure 7 of the IS/MND, the playground would be located
                                    adjacent to Bay Road. Given the proximity of the playground to the existing
                                    noise of Bay Road, noise associated with children on the playground would
                                    not be expected to exceed the existing ambient noise level. Additionally,
                                    noise sensitive receptors would be residential uses that are located
                                    approximately 630 feet from the proposed outdoor active use areas. As
                                    stated in the IS/MND, noise levels associated with the project would not be
                                    substantially greater than existing noise sources, such that an impact would
                                    result.

Response B-13:                      Noise from the San Carlos Airport is addressed on page 74 of the IS/MND.
                                    As noted in the IS/MND, the project site is located 2.5 miles from the San
                                    Carlos Airport, and is located outside of the airport’s 55 dBA CNEL noise
                                    contour. Therefore noise associated with the airport on the project site
                                    would be less than 55 dBA CNEL. According to the City of Redwood City
                                    General Plan (see page 71 of the IS/MND), noise levels of up to 65 dBA CNEL
                                    are considered conditionally acceptable for school uses. Therefore noise
                                    associated with the airport would not result in a significant impact.

Response B-14:                      A detailed discussion on the analysis of potential health risks from
                                    contaminated soil, groundwater, and vapors is presented on pages 54 to 55
                                    of the IS/MND. As discussed on page 54 of the IS/MND, the analytical
                                    results from soil, groundwater, and vapor samples collected at the project
                                    site were compared to health-risk screening values based on residential land
                                    use, which is a conservative approach since residential screening values

                                                                                                               15
                                    assume long-term and frequent exposures; and students or school staff
                                    typically have less exposure, both in terms of duration and frequency, than
                                    a residential receptor. 3 For the vapor samples, the preliminary screening
                                    included comparison of analytical results from soil vapor samples collected
                                    under the building to indoor air screening levels and assumed default vapor
                                    attenuation rates from the subsurface into indoor air in accordance with
                                    Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) guidelines. 4 Measured
                                    concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were reported in one
                                    or more of the sub-slab vapor samples (samples of the vapors that have
                                    collected directly under the concrete floor of the building) at levels that
                                    indicated subsurface VOCs may migrate into buildings at concentrations
                                    above residential indoor air screening values. The tricholorethene (TCE)
                                    indoor air concentration estimated from the vapor samples collected also
                                    exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (U.S. EPA) “prompt
                                    response action level.” 5,6 Because the conservative preliminary screening
                                    indicated that volatilization to indoor air could be a concern, additional
                                    sampling was performed to further evaluate the magnitude and extent of
                                    impacts from hazardous materials in the subsurface of the project site, and
                                    a sub-slab depressurization system (SSDS) was installed at the project site to
                                    prevent vapors from collecting inside the building at unsafe levels.

                                    As discussed on page 55 of the IS/MND, as of April 2016, the DTSC is actively
                                    providing regulatory oversight for the project site, and DTSC approved the
                                    Indoor Air Sampling and Mitigation Work Plan (Work Plan) 7 to test the
                                    effectiveness of the SSDS that has been installed at the project site. The

      Vapor concentration decrease (attenuate) as they move from the subsurface into indoor air. The
      attenuation occurs as a result of the processes that control vapor migration, which are diffusion and
      advection, coupled with the dilution that occurs when the vapors enter a building and mix with indoor air.
                                                                       th
      The default attenuation rate is conservatively based on the 90 percentile of the U.S. EPA’s national
      empirical vapor intrusion database; the actual attenuation rate will depend on a number of factors such as
      chemical volatility, temperature, amount and magnitude of sub-slab cracks, and building interior pressure.

      The U.S. EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) 2011 toxicity assessment concluded that TCE
      exposure poses potential human health hazards for non-cancer toxicity to developing fetuses. This and
      other findings in the IRIS assessment of TCE indicates that women in the first trimester of pregnancy are
      one of the most sensitive populations to TCE inhalation exposure. Therefore, the U.S. EPA established the
      prompt response action level to protect against potential non-cancer outcomes, including developmental
      effects such as cardiac malformations. These recommendations identify women of reproductive age as
      the sensitive population of concern, rather than only pregnant women, because some women may not be
      aware of their pregnancy during the critical period of the first trimester.

                                    risks is a common practice to ensure protection of human health at
                                    properties with impacts from hazardous materials. DTSC has developed
                                    guidelines for the design and construction of vapor intrusion mitigations
                                    systems, including SSDSs, as presented in DTSC’s Vapor Intrusion Mitigation
                                    Advisory. 8 As discussed in the Work Plan, the passive SSDS installed at the
                                    project site has been designed based on DTSC’s Vapor Intrusion Mitigation
                                    Advisory to continuously create a lower pressure directly underneath the
                                    building floor relative to the pressure within the building, inhibiting soil
                                    vapors from flowing into the building.

                                    As discussed in the Work Plan, four indoor air sampling events will be
                                    performed following installation of the SSDS. In January 2017, an Indoor Air
                                    Sampling and Passive SSDS Installation Summary Letter (Summary Letter) 9
                                    was prepared for the project site and submitted to DTSC. The letter
                                    provided details on the installation of the SSDS and documented two
                                    subsequent indoor air sampling events performed in July and September of
                                    2016. The Summary Letter indicated that detected concentrations of
                                    contaminants in the indoor air were below residential screening levels with
                                    the exception of benzene, which was above the screening level. The
                                    concentrations of benzene and other petroleum hydrocarbon related VOCs
                                    (e.g., toluene and ethylbenzene) detected in indoor air were consistent with
                                    concentrations detected in ambient air outside the building. Installation of
                                    the SSDS appears to have reduced the concentrations of contaminants in
                                    indoor air, however the Summary Letter recommended installing a vapor
                                    barrier and converting the SSDS to an active system to ensure protection of
                                    receptors. Conversion to an active SSDS system would include the
                                    installation of a mechanical blower on the vapor discharge vent pipe to
                                    increase the ventilation of sub-slab vapors and further reduce the intrusion
                                    of vapors into the building. The Summary Letter also requested that DTSC
                                    approve this mitigation plan and construction of the Rocketship Redwood
                                    City Elementary School.

                                    In February 2017, DTSC issued a Comment Letter 10 on the Summary Letter
                                    which requested clarification on indoor air sampling procedures and
                                    requested two more rounds of indoor air sampling, as the original Work
                                    Plan had called for.

                                    The IS/MND acknowledges on page 55 that since this confirmation testing
                                    was not completed or available for review prior to completion of the CEQA
                                    process, the issue of potential VOC exposure within the building was not yet
                                    fully resolved and therefore is a potentially significant impact. Therefore, the
                                    IS/MND required implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, which
                                    requires the project sponsor to provide to the City and County a concurrence
                                    letter from the DTSC that indicates the proposed use of the site as a school
                                    poses no unacceptable health risks to project users associated with residual
                                    subsurface contamination; and requires that construction at the project site
                                    be conducted under a project-specific Construction Risk Management Plan
                                    (CRMP), or equivalent document as specified by the DTSC, to protect
                                    construction workers, the general public, and the environment from
                                    subsurface hazardous materials previously identified and to address the
                                    possibility of encountering unknown contamination or hazards in the
                                    subsurface. Implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1 would ensure that
                                    potentially significant impacts related to subsurface hazardous materials
                                    would be reduced to a less-than-significant level, as DTSC would ensure that
                                    the CRMP, or equivalent document as specified by the DTSC, would protect
                                    construction workers, the general public, and the environment from
                                    subsurface hazardous materials, and DTSC would ensure that the SSDS and
                                    vapor barrier would adequately mitigate soil vapor intrusion to indoor air to
                                    levels that would be protective of human health prior to allowing occupancy
                                    of the project site by the Rocketship Redwood City Elementary School.

Response B-15:                      Potential impacts associated with seismic activity at the site are addressed
                                    on pages 41 through 43 of the IS/MND. As stated on page 42, the risks
                                    associated with ground shaking at the site would be reduced through
                                    adherence to the design and materials standards set forth in applicable
                                    building codes, including those adopted by the City and County. As stated in
                                    Mitigation Measure GEO-1a, the recommendations of a Geotechnical
                                    Investigation Report would be required to be incorporated into all design
                                    and engineering plans for the project and would take into account the
                                    quality and suitability of the soils that underlie the site. Final plans would be
                                    required to be reviewed and approved by the City and County prior to the
                                    issuance of site-specific building permits. While the exact design specifica-

                                    project are not known at this time, the City and County would review the
                                    design for compliance with applicable safety standards and codes as part of
                                    implementation of Mitigation Measure GEO-1a. Further, it is reasonable to
                                    assume that such a structure would have safety measures and locking
                                    mechanisms installed to prevent vehicles from becoming dislodged during a
                                    seismic event.

Response B-16:                      Stormwater flows from the project site are discussed on pages 62 through
                                    63 of the IS/MND. As discussed, the project applicant would be required to
                                    prepare and implement a Stormwater Control Plan to comply with the
                                    runoff requirements outlined in Provision C.3 of the Water Board’s
                                    Municipal Regional Permit. Further, as stated on page 64 of the IS/MND,
                                    implementation of the project would decrease impervious surfaces on the
                                    site, which in turn would decrease the rate of stormwater runoff from the
                                    site onto adjacent sites and the public storm drain system compared to
                                    existing conditions. Bioretention systems to be included as part of the
                                    proposed project would be designed to retain stormwater flows on site and
                                    to allow rainwater to percolate to the subsurface. Impacts to adjacent
                                    properties related to increased stormwater flows from the site would
                                    therefore not occur and would be less than significant.

Response B-17:                      This concluding comment is noted. The concerns outlined in this comment
                                    are addressed in Responses B-1 through B-16, above.

Response C-1:                       Based on the significance criteria established by the City of Redwood City
                                    and the County of San Mateo, the project would not cause a significant
                                    impact on the adjacent street network. Likewise, the project will meet the
                                    parking requirements expressed in the City of Redwood City’s zoning
                                    ordinance. The on-site parking is sufficient to accommodate all full and part-
                                    time school employees as well as some parent volunteers. Although not
                                    required to mitigate a significant impact of the project, the project applicant
                                    is pursuing additional off-site parking to accommodate parent parking
                                    demand during school events in the evening. It is recommended that
                                    Rocketship work with the County of San Mateo to prohibit on-street parking
                                    on both sides of the staff parking lot driveway on Charter Street to remedy
                                    the existing sight distance deficiency. Any parking restrictions must be
                                    approved by the Board of Supervisors. As part of the approval process, the
                                    Board will seek input from nearby property owners. The Board may or may
                                    not approve the removal of on-street parking.

Response D-1:                       As stated in Section XVI, Transportation/Traffic of the IS/MND, the proposed
                                    project would result in a less-than-significant impact on traffic conditions in
                                    the area. The project includes construction of a bulb-out on the southwest
                                    corner of the Bay/Charter intersection, which would improve the environ-
                                    ment for pedestrians. The existing parking along the western edge of the
                                    site is fully occupied at times by vehicles associated with adjacent
                                    businesses who park there for convenience. The project applicant is not
                                    legally obligated to provide parking for any other business. The removal of
                                    parking is not considered an impact on the environment under CEQA and
                                    will be considered by City decision-makers as part of the project approval
                                    process. The proposed new school includes on-site parking in accordance
                                    with the City’s zoning ordinance. The on-site parking is sufficient to
                                    accommodate all full and part-time school employees as well as some
                                    parent volunteers.

Response D-2:                       The proposed on-site parking (38 spaces) meets the City’s zoning code and
                                    is sufficient for all school employees plus some parents attending meetings
                                    or volunteering at the school during the day. Parents who are unable to find
                                    a space on site may need to park on-street. Although not required, the
                                    project applicant is pursuing possible off-site parking locations to
                                    accommodate large school events when parent parking demand may be
                                    substantial. Emergency access and refuse collection are described in the
                                    traffic study. The project applicant has submitted a response letter that
                                    describes how food delivery trucks and other service vehicles will be
                                    accommodated on site.

Response D-3:                       See Response B-8 (above) regarding the Stanford parking lot. The City
                                    provided a list of approved and pending developments for consideration in
                                    the traffic study when the analysis was initiated in October 2014. The project
                                    list did not include the uses mentioned by the commenter. County Specialty
                                    Gases has been in business at 2200 Bay Road since 2009 (per November 28,
                                    2016 telephone conversation with Tracy Dominguez, County Specialty Gases).
                                    According to the City’s E-Permit Search website, the SAGE Center for
                                    Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Care at 934 Charter Street applied for a
                                    building permit for interior tenant improvements on February 5, 2015. The
                                    veterinary clinic reoccupied an existing building that has been in place for
                                    more than 25 years without any increase in square footage. The permit was
                                    finalized on October 27, 2016, after completion of the Draft IS/MND for the
                                    proposed Rocketship Redwood Elementary School Project, which was

                                    published September 30, 2016. While traffic impact analyses generally reflect
                                    the traffic generated by approved but not yet constructed and occupied
                                    developments, they do not generally account for re-occupancy of temporarily
                                    vacant buildings or turnover among different tenants permitted under the
                                    same zoning designation. Since specific tenants often change from time to
                                    time without a change in zoning designation, and a certain level of vacancy is
                                    considered typical, this change in tenants does not constitute a substantial
                                    change in traffic conditions that would necessitate an update to the traffic
                                    study.

                                    It is unclear to which school the commenter is referring. The nearby Hoover
                                    Community School and Summit Preparatory Charter High School were both
                                    in session when traffic counts were conducted at study intersections. Per
                                    CEQA guidelines, the traffic analysis reflects all known projects at the time
                                    the Rocketship traffic analysis was initiated.

Response D-4:                       Refer to Response to Comment B-14 regarding the measures being
                                    implemented to mitigate potential impacts from hazardous materials
                                    detected beneath the site building. Sampling of soil, groundwater, and soil
                                    gas has been performed in the parking lot area of the project site as
                                    presented in the results of previous environmental investigations performed
                                    in 2014, which are available on the State Water Resources Control Board’s
                                    GeoTracker Website. 11,12 Significant concerns were not detected in soil,
                                    groundwater, or soil gas samples collected from the parking lot area.

                                    Mitigation Measure HAZ-1 of the IS/MND and discussed under Response B-
                                    14, would address the possibility of encountering unknown contamination
                                    or hazards in the subsurface of the parking lot. Additionally, off-gassing of
                                    soil vapor does not typically pose a risk of exposure in an outdoor setting as
                                    vapors quickly dissipate in an outdoor environment.

Response D-5:                       There are expected to be at most 35 staff vehicles, assuming everyone
                                    drives alone, for which parking is being provided. Parents will not park on
                                    campus but will drop-off and pick-up students in the proposed drop-off
                                    lanes. The project is expected to generate 462 vehicle trips (250 inbound
                                    and 212 outbound) during the AM peak hour and 247 net vehicle trips (101
                                    inbound and 146 outbound) during the PM peak hour. The vehicle trips are
                                    less than the number of students and staff because of carpooling and use of
                                    alternative modes of transportation. The traffic analysis found that the

                                    project would have a less-than-significant impact on the surrounding
                                    roadways. Furthermore, queues associated with student loading are
                                    expected to be contained on site. Therefore, the increase in vehicle trips is
                                    not expected to cause back-ups on the adjacent roadways that interfere
                                    with driveways of adjacent businesses. The traffic volumes on Charter Street
                                    between Spring Street and Bay Road (400 to 500 vehicles per hour
                                    combined total for both directions) are low enough such that vehicles
                                    exiting driveways on this block are expected to experience minimal delay on
                                    average. However, because school traffic has an AM and a PM peak, there
                                    may be brief periods lasting five to ten minutes where traffic volumes are
                                    above average causing more delay for driveway traffic attempting to turn
                                    onto Charter Street. Pedestrian traffic along Charter Street is expected to
                                    increase, however, the effect on driveway operations is expected to be
                                    minimal.

Response E-1:                       This comment is noted and will be considered by City decision-makers. As
                                    stated on pages 67 through 69 of the IS/MND, the proposed project would
                                    be consistent with the requirements of applicable City and County zoning
                                    districts and General Plan policies, including the required findings of
                                    applicable conditional use permits. As also discussed throughout the
                                    IS/MND, impacts of the project would be less than significant and no
                                    impacts related to safety would occur.

Response E-2:                       This comment is noted. Please see Response B-2 regarding the adequacy of
                                    the IS/MND.

Response E-3:                       As a condition of project approval, the proposed project would be required
                                    to comply with applicable building and fire code requirements, including
                                    restrictions on maximum occupancy, which are partially intended to prevent
                                    overcrowding and allow safe evacuation of building occupants during
                                    emergency events. The project applicant would be required to develop an
                                    emergency evacuation plan for review and approval of the Fire Department
                                    prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The Fire Department has
                                    approved of the proposed fire access plan for the site. 13

Response F-1:                       The traffic study evaluates vehicle queue lengths during peak drop off and
                                    pick up hours and concluded that the on-site vehicle storage would be
                                    sufficient to prevent backups from extending onto the public street. As
                                    described in the IS/MND, the project is not expected to result in queues that
                                    block driveways for adjacent properties.

Response F-2:                       This comment does not indicate how the traffic study was inadequate or
                                    incorrect and is noted.

Response F-3:                       Please refer to Response F-7, below, which further addresses this comment.

Response F-4:                       The inbound site driveway on Charter Street is close to the intersection at
                                    Bay Road as noted by the commenter. There will be times when a queue at
                                    the Charter Street approach to Bay Road temporarily blocks access to the
                                    school entrance driveway. Traffic operations at the intersection of Charter
                                    Street and Bay Road will be improved with the addition of a traffic signal,
                                    which was identified as a mitigation measure for the Stanford in Redwood
                                    City development.

                                    The school is not planning to allow vehicles to enter the site in groups of
                                    nine as stated in the comment. As stated in the traffic report, the on-site
                                    loading area allows nine vehicles to load and unload simultaneously. Behind
                                    the loading zone, there is an additional 258 feet of space divided between
                                    two lanes for vehicles to queue on site while waiting to enter the loading
                                    area. Thus, it is expected that project traffic will proceed along Charter
                                    Street mixed with other traffic and turn into the school site and wait in the
                                    designated queuing area for their turn to enter the loading area. Based on
                                    observations of drop-off and pick-up operations at other Rocketship
                                    Schools, it was concluded that vehicle queues would be contained on site.
                                    Furthermore, the project applicant has proposed to implement Travel
                                    Demand Management measures that will encourage parents, students,
                                    teachers and staff to use alternative modes of transportation, which will
                                    also help to ensure that drop-off and pick-up queues do not extend onto
                                    Charter Street. Nevertheless, if unexpectedly long queues do occur causing
                                    backups onto Charter Street, staff will instruct parents to proceed past the
                                    project driveway to prevent queues from blocking through traffic and
                                    interfering with access to and from adjacent businesses. It should be noted
                                    that peak traffic conditions last only about five to ten minutes immediately
                                    before and after school. The potential need for parents to circulate around

                                    the block is not anticipated but may be enacted for a very brief time if
                                    necessary.

Response F-5:                       The delay experienced by the commenter traveling through the Charter/Bay
                                    intersection on a particular date and time may have differed from the delay
                                    shown in the traffic study prepared for the proposed project for several
                                    reasons. Traffic volumes are not uniform throughout the peak hour. The
                                    commenter may have arrived during the peak 5-minute period within the
                                    hour, whereas the traffic report reflects the average delay throughout the
                                    entire hour. Traffic volumes fluctuate slightly from one day to the next, thus
                                    the traffic volumes may have been slightly higher on the date when the
                                    commenter measured intersection delay than when the traffic count was
                                    conducted on January 27, 2015. In addition, the commenter does not
                                    indicate whether he turned left, continued straight, or turned right onto Bay
                                    Road from Charter Street. The delay will vary by turn movement. The delay
                                    reported in the traffic study is the weighted average delay for all movements
                                    that share the lane. Thus, for Charter Street, where all movements are made
                                    from a single shared lane, the reported delay is the weighted average for all
                                    movements. The project is not expected to increase the delay at this
                                    intersection because the project is not expected to add any trips to this
                                    intersection during the peak hours. Project trips are expected to approach
                                    from eastbound Charter Street, turn right into the project site, and then exit
                                    onto southbound Bay Road, thus avoiding the Charter/Bay intersection.

Response F-6:                       As stated in the traffic study prepared for the proposed project, the project is
                                    not expected to cause queues to extend onto Charter Street. Furthermore,
                                    the project is not expected to increase the trips or delay at the intersection
                                    of Charter Street and Bay Road. The additional project trips added to other
                                    study intersections would not result in a significant impact based on the City
                                    and County thresholds of significance. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that
                                    the project would have a less-than-significant impact on emergency vehicle
                                    access.

Response F-7:                       This comment is related to odor impacts and health effects from odors. The
                                    BAAQMD is the responsible agency for receiving air pollution and odor
                                    complaints in the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the BAAQMD, a
                                    project would result in an odor impact if it would locate a new receptor in
                                    an area with existing odor sources. The determination of significance for
                                    existing odor sources is “an odor source with five or more confirmed
                                    complaints per year averaged over three years.” Based on a public records
                                    request to the BAAQMD, there were two odor complaints of gas or gasoline
                                    in Redwood City from 2011 to 2016. The first complaint was an unconfirmed
                                    odor of gasoline in 2011 at the Sims Metal Management, which is located
                                    approximately 2 miles from the project site. The second complaint was an
                                    unconfirmed odor of gas in 2013 at an unidentified location. Based on
                                    communications with the BAAQMD, Redwood City Fire Department, and

                                                                                                                31
                                    PG&E, there were no confirmed odor complaints of gasoline or LP gas near
                                    the project site.14,15 Based on the lack of evidence supporting the
                                    commenter’s claim of frequent odors in the area, exposure of future
                                    students on the project site is not expected to result in a significant impact.
                                    The BAAQMD also provides a database of permitted pollution sources
                                    within the Bay Area. Stationary sources of air pollution in the project vicinity
                                    are shown in Table 3 on page 33 of the IS/MND. As shown in Table 3, there
                                    are several sources of emissions in the project vicinity; however the health
                                    risk associated with these sources were found to be less than significant.
                                    Therefore, students at the proposed project are not expected to be exposed
                                    to substantial odor sources or toxic air contaminants with health effects.

                                    Nevertheless, to further ensure that students are not exposed to potential
                                    odors associated with existing uses in the project vicinity, it is recommended
                                    that the following measures be implemented as a condition of project
                                    approval:

                                                Recommended Measure AIR-1: The project applicant should install a
                                                mechanical ventilation system to ensure that all windows and doors
                                                can remain closed during school hours. In the event that gas or
                                                other similar odors are detected by school staff during operating
                                                hours, all students should remain indoors and the odor should be
                                                reported to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District for
                                                further investigation.

Response G-6:                       Please refer to Responses E-1 regarding land use compatibility and
                                    Responses B-9, C-1, D-1, and D-2 regarding parking.

Response G-7:                       Please refer to Response E-1 regarding land use compatibility. If the outdoor
                                    portion of the proposed school use were within the City’s jurisdiction, a
                                    Conditional Use Permit would be required, similar to the permit required by
                                    the County to permit the requested use. It should also be noted that
                                    impacts associated with the outdoor play area - such as exposure of
                                    sensitive receptors to noise and air quality emissions associated with
                                    existing conditions – were determined to be less than significant.

Response G-8:                       Please refer to the responses throughout this memorandum that address
                                    specific concerns related to the adequacy of the traffic study prepared for
