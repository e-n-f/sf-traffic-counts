3. METHODOLOGY & ANALYSIS SCOPING

Peak-hour level of service (LOS) is determined by using the methodology described in the 2010
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Trip generation for the site is calculated using data contained
in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (2012).
The data was used to calculate the average daily trips (ADT) and PM peak-hour trip generation

City of Newcastle TIA Guidelines identifies a minimum forecast period of 10 years with a 3%
annual growth rate; therefore, analysis has been conducted for 2024. Additionally, the city keeps
track of projects vested before this application but not yet built that need to be included into the
analysis as “pipeline” projects. The five study intersections listed below have been identified as
meeting the requirements for additional level of service (LOS) analysis in the PM peak-hour.

   1.   Newcastle Way at Site Access (combined) - Unsignalized
   2.   Newcastle Way at Coal Creek Parkway - Signalized
   3.   Newcastle Way at 125th Avenue SE – Unsignalized
   4.   Newcastle Way at 123rd Avenue SE – Unsignalized
   5.   Newcastle Way at 121st Place SE – Unsignalized

The intersection at Newcastle Way and 129th Avenue SE was not analyzed per city scoping as
the development does not add any volume to the northbound and southbound approaches and
prior recent studies have shown it to operate at acceptable level of service. A PM peak-hour
traffic count was performed at the intersection of Newcastle Way and Coal Creek Parkway in
April of 2013 as a part of the Newcastle Middle School TIA also performed by GTC and was
used in the original March 2014 TIA for the Newcastle Way development. Existing counts for
intersections numbered three through five were collected in 2014. These counts were used as
existing counts in the LOS analysis. Pipeline data for three projects (Avalon Newcastle Mutual
Materials Site (Brickyard), Residences at Lake Boren, and Aegis Newcastle) were required to be
included in the 2024 future baseline calculations as directed by the City of Newcastle.
Additionally, pipeline trips from the Newcastle Middle School analysis were included in the
2024 future analysis even though they were not required by the City of Newcastle due to the fact
that the subject application was submitted prior to the Middle School’s application to the City.
Note: All of these official and unofficial pipeline trips are in addition to the required 3% annual
growth rate.

Traffic congestion on roadways is generally measured in terms of LOS at critical intersections.
In accordance with the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, roadway facilities and intersections are
rated between LOS A and F, with LOS A being free flow and LOS F being forced flow or over-
capacity conditions. The LOS at signalized intersections and all-way stop-controlled
intersections are based on the average stopped delay for all entering vehicles. The LOS at
two-way stop-controlled intersections is based on stopped delay times for the critical approach or
movement(s). Geometric characteristics and conflicting traffic movements are taken into
consideration when determining LOS values. A summary of the level of service criteria has
been included in Table 1.

The acceptable level of service at arterial to local access intersections within the City of
Newcastle is level of service D and level of service E in the Community Business Center (CBC).
The intersections located at Newcastle Way and 121st Place SE, 123rd Avenue SE, and 125th
Avenue SE are located outside the CBC.

     LOS A: Free-flow traffic conditions, with minimal delay to stopped vehicles (no vehicle is delayed longer
              than one cycle at signalized intersection).
     LOS B: Generally stable traffic flow conditions.
     LOS C: Occasional back-ups may develop, but delay to vehicles is short term and still tolerable.
     LOS D: During short periods of the peak hour, delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial but are
              tolerable during times of less demand (i.e. vehicles delayed one cycle or less at signal).
     LOS E: Intersections operate at or near capacity, with long queues developing on all approaches and long
              delays.
     LOS F: Jammed conditions on all approaches with excessively long delays and vehicles unable to move at
              times.
2   When demand volume exceeds the capacity of the lane, extreme delays will be encountered with queuing which
    may cause severe congestion affecting other traffic movements in the intersection.

       4. EXISTING CONDITIONS

           4.1 Transit Service

       King County Metro Transit provides public transit service within King County. There are two
       Metro Transit routes, 114 and 240, which provide service in the vicinity of Newcastle Way and
       Coal Creek Parkway. Route 114 connects Downtown Seattle to the Renton Highlands through
       Newcastle and runs every 30 minutes in the AM to Seattle and PM to Renton Highlands. Route
       240 provides service from the Bellevue Transit Center to Renton with headways every 30
       minutes throughout the entire day. The Newcastle Transit Center (Bus parking east of 129th
       Avenue SE) is less than 660 feet away from the proposed location of the eastern-most access of
       the development.

           4.2 Roadway Network

       Newcastle Way is a two-lane minor arterial with a posted speed limit of 30 mph. There are
       raised curbs on a both sides of the street and a raised sidewalk on the north side of the street
       along the development’s frontage. Coal Creek Parkway is a five-lane principal arterial with a
       posted speed limit of 35 mph. There are five-foot shoulders, curb, gutter, and sidewalk on both
       sides of the street.

           4.3 Collision Data

       Collision data for all collisions within the City of Newcastle was requested from WSDOT for the
       four complete previous years (2011-2013) and for preliminary/partial 2014 data. The collision
       rate for each existing study intersection and Newcastle Way at 116th Avenue SE was calculated
       from the WSDOT data. Table 2 summarizes the data received by WSDOT.

The intersection of Newcastle Way and Coal Creek Parkway had the highest collision rate of the
study area and had rear-end and entering at angle collisions as the most common. The entire
length of Newcastle Way from 116th Avenue SE to Coal Creek Parkway has a collision rate
(collisions per million entering vehicles) less than the average rate of 2.27 for principal arterials
in WSDOT’s Northwest Region. The development will therefore not be contributing to an
existing safety issue.

   4.4 Existing Volumes and Level of Service

Existing turning movement counts at all the study intersections were obtained by the
independent count firms All Traffic Data (ATD) on Tuesday April 16, 2013 and Idax Data
Solutions on August 20, 2014 and December 4, 2014. The existing peak-hour turning movement
volumes are shown at the study intersections during the PM peak-hour (4-6 PM) in Figure 2.
Based on the existing counts, channelization, and intersection control the existing level of
service is summarized for the PM peak-hour in Table 3. The existing level of service
calculations are included in the attachments.

5. FUTURE CONDITIONS

   5.1 Trip Generation

Trip generation calculations for the 12833 Newcastle Way development are based on national
statistics contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th
Edition (2012). An industry standard pass-by rate of 25% was assumed for the specialty retail
portion of the development. Average trip generation rates for the following ITE Land Use Codes
have been used for the trip generation calculations:

      LUC 223 (Mid-Rise Apartments) – 76 Units
      LUC 710 (General Office) – 549 SF
      LUC 826 (Specialty Retail) – 1,592 SF

Table 4 summarizes the trip generation calculations. Full trip generation calculations are
included in the attachments.

ITE’s Trip Generation Manual 9th Edition does not contain a daily trip generation rate for Mid-
Rise Apartment. Therefore a ratio of PM peak-hour rates between Mid-Rise Apartment and
Apartment multiplied by the daily trip generation rate for Apartment was used as an estimate
(6.65*(0.39/0.62) = 4.18). This estimated daily rate has been accepted by multiple local
jurisdictions and does not influence the level of service analysis.

   5.2 Trip Distribution

Trip distribution is based on the distribution of employment, shopping, and education
destinations in the site vicinity as well as a PM peak-hour count collected at Coal Creek
Parkway. It is estimated that 10% of the trips will be local to and from the commercial
businesses surrounding the Newcastle Way and Coal Creek Parkway intersection. 40% is
expected to travel to and from the west on Newcastle Way. Another 40% is expected to travel
along Coal Creek Parkway—thirty percent to and from the north and ten percent to and from the
south. The remaining 10% are expected to travel to and from the east on Newcastle Way/SE 72nd
Place. Trip distributions for the PM peak-hour are shown in Figure 3.

   5.3 2024 Baseline Volumes and Level of Service

Per the City of Newcastle TIA guidelines, a 10 year planning outlook was required for any
development generating more than 10 PM peak-hour trips and subject to a SEPA review. The
2024 baseline (future without project) turning movement volumes are estimated by applying a
3.0% annual compounding growth rate to the existing turning movement volumes per the City
traffic impact analysis guidelines. The City of Newcastle also identified 3 pipeline projects
required to be included in the 2024 analysis: Avalon Newcastle Mutual Materials Site
(Brickyard), Residences at Lake Boren, and Aegis Newcastle. Additionally, GTC included the
pipeline trips from the Newcastle Middle School analysis in the 2024 baseline conditions even
though it was not required by the City of Newcastle to estimate the highest future volume case.
The inclusion of all pipeline projects and the required 3% annual growth results in annually
compounding growth rates at the study intersections between 3.4% and 4.4%. The 2024 baseline
turning movement volumes for the PM peak-hour are shown in Figures 4.

With the addition of baseline growth and the turning movements of the pipeline projects the
level of service at the two-way stop controlled (TWSC) intersections is expected to be LOS D or
better after planned improvements to Newcastle Way have been implemented. The signalized
intersection at Coal Creek Parkway and Newcastle Way is expected to operate at LOS F even
after signal optimization due to the theoretical 3% per year growth rate forecast. The LOS
calculations are summarized for the PM peak-hour in Table 5. The baseline LOS calculations
are included in the attachments.

   5.4 2024 Future with Development Volumes and Level of Service

The 2024 future with project turning movement volumes are calculated by adding all of the
development traffic based on the trip distribution to the 2024 baseline turning movement
volumes. The 2024 future with project turning movement volumes for the PM peak-hour are
shown in Figures 5.

With the addition of development traffic, the level of service is summarized for the PM peak-
hour in Table 5. All of the study intersections are expected to operate at the same LOS as
identified in the 2024 Baseline conditions while adding between 0.1 and 4.7 seconds of delay
depending whether future improvements are included in the analysis. Also to estimate worst
case conditions the analysis did not increase peak hour factors, even with the 30-40% future
growth in trips, and didn’t reduce delay for the de-facto right turn pocket movements that are
occurring today. Therefore, the analysis is very conservative and still shows acceptable future
operations at all the unsignalised intersections.

The City of Newcastle Impact Fee Rate Analysis specifically cites previously constructed
roadway projects eligible to be included in the impact fee calculations and lists improvements
made to Coal Creek Parkway as one of them (Section 2.4.2 of the July 2014 Transportation
Impact Fee Rate Analysis report prepared by David Evans and Associates, Inc.). Therefore, the
mitigation fees being paid by the 12833 Newcastle Way development will off-set the
development’s impacts to the intersection of Coal Creek Parkway and Newcastle Way.
Additionally, the intersection is expected to operate at an acceptable level of service when trips
from pipeline projects and the 12833 Newcastle Way development only are included in future
analysis. The assumed 3.0% annual compounded growth over 10 years (ie 30+% theoretical
forecast) is what causes the intersection Coal Creek Parkway to operate at level of service F.
The development only adds 3.5 seconds of delay to the intersection and accounts for less than
0.5% of the future traffic volume through that intersection that was improved in part using the
developer’s traffic mitigation fee. All the trips generated by the development were analyzed
using a single access to be conservative (worst case analysis) about the impacts to Newcastle
Way. The 2024 future with level of service calculations are included in the attachments.

   5.5 Opening Year Parking Demand/Supply

The City of Newcastle Municipal Code, NMC 18.18.030, identifies the parking requirements for
apartments based on the number of bedrooms in each unit. The development will consist of 67
1-bedroom units and 9 2-bedroom units. Total residential parking required would equate to 88
parking spaces including 1 additional guest parking space for every 10 units. The 1,592 SF of
retail space in the building would fall under the “non-food retail in mixed-use development, less
than 5,000 SF” category and require 5 parking spaces. Office space is required to provide 1
parking space per 500 SF, thus the 549 SF office component of the development will require 1
parking space. The total parking required for the development is 94 spaces.

On-site delivery and move-in/move-out vehicles will be able to park in designated guest parking
spaces during dedicated hours. Coordination between residential/commercial staff and delivery
companies will determine when those hours will be.

   5.6 Pedestrian Improvements

The development will implement the required frontage improvements along Newcastle Way
which include new curb, gutter, and sidewalk. The completed frontage improvements will
provide dedicated pedestrian connection to routes serving nearby businesses and transit stops.

   5.7 Sight Distance

Newcastle Way is classified as a minor arterial and as such has an associated design speed of 40
mph per Table 1.1 of the Newcastle Public Works Standards. The locations of the two proposed
accesses are expected to meet the minimum requirements of 305 feet of stopping sight distance
and 445 feet of intersection sight distance as stated in AASHTO standards for a 40 mph design
speed based on initial observations by GTC staff. It is our understanding that the City is
updating the roadway standards and this may impact the required entering sight distances. The
driveways will be constructed to have safe stopping and entering sight distance.


6. TRAFFIC MITIGATION

   6.1 On-Site/Access Improvements

The development will provide two accesses to Newcastle Way and will be compliant with City
of Newcastle Public Works Standards and WSDOT Standard Details for spacing.

     6.1 Off-Site Mitigation/Improvements

 As stated in Section VI of the Pre-Application Report for the 12833 Newcastle Way
 development, the development will be required to dedicate 12 feet to ROW to complete the 42-
 foot half ROW width. Additionally, the construction of a center refuge lane will be required for
 the length of the project—an extension of the existing two-way left-turn lane east of the
 development—and pavement widening to include an 11-foot driving lane and 5-foot bike lane to
 match existing pavement markings adjacent to the development.

 The City of Newcastle typically assesses transportation impact fees to developments for off-site
 improvements. The City of Newcastle has established an impact fee of $6,475.00 per PM peak-
 hour trip. The City of Newcastle identifies an impact fee for apartments based only on ITE Land
 Use Code 220 Apartment, which has a PM peak-hour trip rate of 0.62 trips per unit. This results
 in a prorated traffic fee of $4,015 per unit (0.62 x $6,475). However, the 12833 Newcastle Way
 development is better described as a mid-rise apartment (ITE LUC 223) because it falls within
 the description of rental units in a three to ten story building given within the ITE Trip
 Generation Manual 9th Edition. Therefore, with a PM peak-hour trip generation rate of 0.39 trips
 per unit, its mitigation fee per unit should be a prorated amount of $2,525.25 per unit.

 Similarly, the City of Newcastle does not identify a specific mitigation fee per square foot of
 LUC 826 Specialty Retail. ITE Trip Generation Manual 9th Edition identifies a PM peak-hour
 trip generation rate of 2.71 trip per 1,000 SF. When prorated to the general $6,475 fee per PM
 peak-hour trip and a 25% pass-by rate is included, the traffic mitigation fee would equate to a fee
 of $13.16 per SF.

 The City of Newcastle identifies a traffic mitigation fee of $9.65 per SF for LUC 710 General
 Office with no pass-by rate assumed. No alteration of this fee was done for the 12833 Newcastle
 Way development. Table 6 summarizes the components of the 12833 Newcastle Way traffic
 mitigation fee.

The total traffic mitigation fee for the 12833 Newcastle Way development would equate to
$218,167.57. However, the City of Newcastle has identified increasing the number of lanes to
Newcastle Way along the site’s frontage as a project in the Transportation Impact Fee Rate
Analysis. Based on the extent of the improvements to Newcastle Way required to be constructed
by the project the amount spent by the developer to implement the frontage and capacity
improvements will likely equal or exceed the $218,167.57 due in payment to the City in the form
of standard transportation mitigation fees and is therefore eligible to be credited to the developer
as outlined in NMC 16.15.060(A). The final monetary amount credited towards the development
must be agreed upon by the City of Newcastle and the developer.


7. CONCLUSIONS

The 12833 Newcastle Way mixed-use development will include 76 apartment units ranging in
size from 1-2 bedrooms as well as 1,592 SF of retail space and 549 SF of general office space.

The development is estimated to generate a total of 377 average daily trips with 34 trips (19
inbound/15 outbound) during the PM peak-hour. The development will not cause any of the
study intersections to operate at a worse level of service than the 2024 baseline conditions. The
development is subject to a traffic mitigation fee worth $218,167.57—all of which is eligible to
be credited to the development depending on the cost of frontage and capacity improvements to
Newcastle Way.
