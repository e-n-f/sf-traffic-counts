Subject:        Rose Hill Preliminary Plat, Phase 2 Traffic Impact Analysis

This memorandum describes UCP Rose Hill’s proposed Rose Hill Preliminary Plat project. The
scope of this analysis has been previously approved by City of Redmond staff and includes a
review of trip generation estimates, pipeline and with-project traffic volumes, traffic operations at
both NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE and site accesses, signal warrant analysis, and mitigation
measures.


Project Description
The proposed project includes the construction of 29 single-family residential units located east of
138th Avenue NE and south of NE 100th Street. Two access points are proposed via 138th
Avenue NE. The project site is currently undeveloped. Figure 1 shows the project site and
surrounding vicinity and Figure 2 shows the preliminary site plan. It is anticipated the development
would be completed and occupied by 2019.

Trip Generation
The following table illustrates the anticipated number of new daily, AM peak hour, and PM peak
hour vehicle trips the proposed development would likely generate. These estimates were derived
by multiplying the proposed number of units (29) by the average daily and peak hour trip
generation rates for Land Use Code No. 210 (“Single-Family Detached Housing”) published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition, 2012).

1.    Average trips rates from ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012


As illustrated above, the proposed development is anticipated to generate approximately 276 new
daily vehicle trips with 22 new trips generated during the AM peak hour and 29 new trips
generated during the PM peak hour.


Traffic Volumes
AM and PM peak period traffic counts were collected at NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE in
March 2016. In addition, 12-hour vehicle volumes were collected in April 2016 on each approach
of the NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE intersection. Detailed intersection traffic counts are
provided in Attachment A.

Future horizon year (2019) without-project AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes were estimated
at NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE by increasing existing through traffic by an annual growth
rate of 2 percent and adding project trips from other developments in the project vicinity (“pipeline
projects”). Anticipated traffic volumes from the following 7 developments were identified via City of
Redmond’s Project Viewer and were used to develop the future without-project traffic volumes:

                North Rose Hill Short Plat                                            Benjamin Estates
                Willow Hill – Lot 9                                                   Gabarino Property
                Fu Short Plat                                                         Heather’s Ridge
                Short Tom-Duplex


A total of 7 developments (either permitted or under construction) were identified in the site vicinity
with sizes ranging from 1 single-family home to 41 single family homes (Heather’s Ridge).

It should be noted that for the developments east of 132nd Avenue NE and north of NE 100th
Street, it was assumed that half of the estimated trips travelling to/from the north would use NE
100th Street to access 132nd Avenue NE and half would use NE 104th Street to the north. As a
conservative assumption, it was assumed approximately 9 single family homes located south of
NE 100th Street could use 138th Avenue NE to access NE 100th Street and would act as through
movements at the proposed project’s site access locations.

Pipeline traffic and project-generated traffic were assigned to the roadway network based on
separate AM and PM distributions. These distributions, shown in Figures 3 and 4, were based on
existing counts at NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE.




                                                                                                                             3
                 Figure 3. AM Peak Hour Distribution and Assignment




                 Figure 4. PM Peak Hour Distribution and Assignment
Most project traffic is anticipated to access the site via 132nd Avenue NE (60 percent from the
south and 35 percent from the north, respectively) during the AM peak hour. During the PM peak
hour, 90 percent of the project trips are expected to access the site from the south while the
remaining 10 percent would access from the north. It is anticipated that 5 percent of the project

                                                                                                    2
trips would access the site via NE 100th Street during the AM peak hour only. Existing (2016),
future (2019) without-project, and future (2019) with-project traffic volumes are summarized in
Figure 5.

Traffic Operations
Intersection level of service (LOS) for existing, future without-, and with-project conditions were
evaluated at the 132nd Avenue NE/ NE 100th Street intersection along with the site accesses
using the Synchro 9 software program based on procedures identified in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM, 2010). All intersection parameters such as channelization and intersection control
were consistent through all analysis scenarios. At side-street stop-controlled intersections, LOS is
measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour of traffic and is reported for the worst
operating movement of the intersection. Attachment B provides a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Attachment C.

The City of Redmond operations standard is LOS D or better. As shown in Table 2, during the AM
peak hour, 132nd Avenue NE/ NE 100th Street operates at LOS D under existing conditions and
would operate at LOS E during both future (2019) without-project and future with-project
conditions. It should be noted that the proposed project would only increase the delay at the
intersection by about 5 seconds between without-project and with-project conditions during the AM
peak hour. Additionally, westbound vehicle queues are not anticipated to exceed 3 vehicles under
with-project conditions.

During the PM peak hour, NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE is anticipated to operate at LOS F
under all three analysis conditions. It should be noted that the westbound approach would only
see an increase in 11 trips with the development of the proposed project. Westbound queues are
not anticipated to exceed 5 vehicles at the study intersection under with-project conditions; this
would be an increase of about 2 vehicles compared to without-project conditions.

Under both AM and PM peak hour periods, the site access intersections are anticipated to operate
at LOS A with less than 10 seconds of delay. Maximum queues at the site accesses are
anticipated to be no more than 1 vehicle.


Signal Warrant Analysis
A signal warrant2 analysis was conducted for the 132nd Avenue NE/ NE 100th Street intersection
under with-project conditions. The following presents the data (geometry and traffic volumes) used
to perform the signal warrant analysis, as well as the findings.

Intersection Geometry and Traffic Volumes
The existing 132nd Avenue NE/ NE 100th Street intersection is a 4-way intersection and is stop-
controlled for the eastbound and westbound approaches. The future (2019) with-project weekday
AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the intersection, as previously mentioned, are shown in
Figure 3. In addition, 12-hour vehicle counts were collected at the intersection in April 2016; these
volumes were also used for the signal warrant analysis. The following sections provide a summary
of the methodology for the signal warrants evaluated for the 132nd Avenue NE/ NE 100th Street
intersection (Warrants 1,2, and 3).

                                                                                                                                4
Warrant 1 – Eight Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 1 consists of two conditions that independently assess whether a traffic signal is
warranted based on traffic volumes. The first condition (Condition A) determines if traffic volumes
at an intersection are consistently high enough throughout an average weekday to warrant the
installation of a signal. The second condition (Condition B) is considered when Condition A is not
met, and assesses whether traffic on the minor street experiences excessive delay due to high
traffic volumes on the major street throughout an average weekday. These two conditions are
combined such that fulfilling either of the two conditions would meet the warrant for installation of a
signal.

Detailed volume threshold criteria are identified for these conditions in the warrant methodology,
and if traffic volumes exceed these thresholds for 8 or more hours on an average weekday, the
signal warrant is satisfied. Alternatively, if neither of Conditions A or B are met, the volume criteria
for both conditions can be reduced to 80 percent of their values such that if both conditions are
then met, then installation of a traffic signal could be warranted.

Based on the future with-project traffic volumes shown in Attachment D, Warrant 1 would not be
satisfied as documented in the traffic volume signal warrant worksheet also provided in
Attachment D.

Warrant 2 – Four Hour Vehicular Volume
Signal Warrant 2 is applied where the volume of intersecting traffic is the primary reason for
considering installation of a traffic signal. The warrant is satisfied by comparing the traffic volumes
on the major street and minor street with a chart included in the MUTCD. If the major and minor
street traffic volumes intersect above the MUTCD chart threshold for four or more one-hour
periods, then the signal warrant would be satisfied.

Based on the future with-project traffic volumes shown in Attachment D, Warrant 2 would not be
satisfied as documented in the traffic volume signal warrant worksheet provided in Attachment D.

Warrant 3 – Peak Hour
Signal Warrant 3 is applied when, for a minimum of one-hour of an average day, the minor-street
traffic suffers undue delay when entering or crossing the major street. The warrant is satisfied by
one of two categories are met:
      If all three of the following conditions exist for four consecutive 15 minute periods:
              o The total stopped time delay by traffic on one of the minor street approaches
                  controlled by a stop sign exceeds 4 vehicle hours for a one lane road; and
              o The volume on the same minor street approach (one direction only) exceeds 100
                  vehicles per hour for one moving lane; and
              o The total entering volume serviced for during the hour equals or exceeds 800
                  vehicles per hour for four or more approaches.
      Comparing the traffic volumes on the major street and minor street with a chart included in
          the MUTCD. If the major street traffic volume and the highest minor street approach
          volume intersect above the MUTCD chart threshold for four or more one-hour periods,
          then the signal warrant would be satisfied.




                                                                                                           5
It should be considered that MUTCD notes that this particular signal warrant “shall only be applied
in unusual cases such as office complexes, manufacturing plants, industrial complexes, or high-
occupancy vehicle facilities that attract or discharge large numbers of vehicles over a short time”
(MUTCD, 2009)). It is unclear as to whether the intersection of 132nd Avenue NE/ NE 100th Street
meets this criterion. Regardless, based on the future with-project traffic volumes shown in
Attachment D, Warrant 3 would not be satisfied as documented in the traffic volume signal
warrant worksheet provided in Attachment D.


Mitigation
Mitigation measures have been identified to reduce potential transportation-related project
impacts. All site accesses operate at LOS C or better and NE 100th Street/132nd Avenue NE
operates at the same LOS during both AM and PM peak hours with or without the addition of
project-generated traffic. Therefore mitigation beyond the City’s transportation impact fees is not
necessary.

Transportation Impact Fees
The project would be required to pay the City’s Transportation Impact Fee. Per the City of
Redmond Impact Fee5, the single family dwelling unit fee is $4,430.66 per unit, resulting in an
impact fee of $128,490 for the 29-unit project. This fee is a preliminary calculation and the final
impact fee would be calculated by the City of Redmond at the time of building permit issuance.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
