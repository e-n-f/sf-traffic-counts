WSECU Bank and Office                                                                     July 2016



                                       Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a Washington State Employees Credit Union (WSECU)
walk-in bank and office in the University District neighborhood in Seattle.


Project Description
The proposed project is located at 1121 NE 45th Street on the southwest corner of the
12th Avenue NE and NE 45th Street intersection as shown on Figure 1. The proposed project
would develop approximately 8,130 square feet of walk-in bank with 58,300 square feet of
general office located on the top 6 floors. An underground parking garage would be
constructed with 67 parking stalls provided; 12 parking spaces would be reserved for
WSECU bank customers, 16 parking spaces reserved for WSECU bank employees, and the
remaining 39 spaces for use by the general office space throughout the remainder of the
building. Access to the garage would be provided via the adjacent alley to the west. A
preliminary site plan is shown on Figure 2. The project site is currently vacant. It is anticipated
that the bank and office development would be complete by 2019.


Study Scope
Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed project, and coordination with the
Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI) staff, the following intersections
were selected for analysis:

    1.   5th Avenue NE / NE 45th Street
    2.   7th Avenue NE / NE 45th Street
    3.   Roosevelt Way NE / NE 45th Street
    4.   11th Avenue / NE 45th Street
    5.   12th Avenue / NE 45th Street
    6.   15th Avenue / NE 45th Street

Additionally, the alley access intersection on NE 45th Street between 11th Avenue NE and
12th Avenue NE was analyzed under future (2019) with-project conditions. The study focuses
on the weekday AM and PM peak hour. The report first describes existing and future (2019)
without-project conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the street system,
existing and future without-project weekday peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations,
traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Forecast (2019) with-project
conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation
system were identified by comparing forecast with-project conditions to the forecast without-
project conditions.

Future
The City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) 2015-2018 Statewide
Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) for the Interstate 5 (I-5) ramp interchange with
NE 45th Street were reviewed to identify any planned improvements that would impact
intersection or roadway capacity in the project vicinity. Based on this review, no planned
transportation improvement projects in the site vicinity that would affect intersection or
roadway capacity and operations. Potential non-motorized and transit related improvements
are described in subsequent sections.


Traffic Volumes
The following summarize the traffic volumes for existing and forecast future without-project
conditions.

Future
Future (2019) without-project traffic volumes were forecast by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 2.5 percent per year was applied to the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic
volumes at each study intersection. The growth rate was determined by discussions with
SDCI staff. Traffic from the following pipeline projects in the project vicinity were also included
in the future without-project volume forecasts:

        4510 11th Ave NE (#3019455) Development of a 201 residential unit building with
         6,000 square feet of retail.

        4230 11th Ave NE (#3017391) Development of a 99 residential unit building.

Future (2019) without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects is shown on Figure 4.


Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS) for each study intersection. For signalized locations, LOS
is measured in average delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At
side-street stop-controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during
the peak hour of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection.
Traffic operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of
service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating
extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of
LOS criteria and definitions.

Weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project
conditions were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9.1 software
program. Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the
operations of the intersections. Signal timing and the Synchro network were provided by the
Seattle Department of Transportation.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2019) without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour conditions are summarized
in Table 2. Trip generation is documented in the subsequent Project Impact section of this
study. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix C.

1.   Level of Service (A – F) as defined by the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board.
2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3.   Worst movement reported for unsignalized intersections where NB = northbound, WBL = westbound left-turn, etc.
4.   Analyzed in HCM 2000 due to signal timing settings.




As shown in Table 2, all existing signalized and unsignalized intersections currently operate
at LOS C or better during the weekday AM and PM peak hour. With the forecast increase in
traffic volumes, the signalized intersections are anticipated to experience minimal increases
in delay over current delays and would continue to operate at the same LOS.


Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify any existing traffic
safety issues. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from the Seattle
Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2013 and
December 31, 2015 and is summarized in Table 3.

The SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next calendar year. This
document is called the 2016 Candidate Locations for High Collision Location Reviews. The
most recent review was completed in 2016 and screens locations for the previous year (in
this case 2015). Locations are identified as a HCL at signalized intersections with 10 or more
collisions in a year, unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, mid-block locations
with 10 or more collisions a year, and locations with 5 or more total pedestrian or bike
collisions in the past three years.

The only intersection or segment within the study area that met the HCL criteria was the
Roosevelt Way NE / NE 45th Street intersection due to pedestrian related accidents. In the
past three full years, there were a total of 6 pedestrian related collisions at this intersection:
     3 collisions occurred in 2015.
     4 of the 6 collisions involved a vehicle traveling straight, 1 vehicle turning right, and 1
        vehicle turning left.
     5 of the 6 collisions occurred in daylight and the remaining collision occurred when it
        was dark with street lights on.
     All 6 collisions resulted in injuries but with no fatalities.

Note that of the six pedestrian collision over the previous three years at the Roosevelt Way
NE / NE 45th Street intersection, four involved a vehicle driving straight striking a crossing
pedestrian. This type of collision occurs when either the drivers or pedestrians involved did
not comply with the traffic control at this location. This intersection was reviewed by SDOT in
2014 and the HCL criteria continued to be met in 2015. No further action nor any specific
improvements are identified by the City at this location.

Future
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), Seattle Transit Master Plan, and King County Metro and Sound Transit upcoming
projects, there are no planned transit improvement projects in the site vicinity that may impact
traffic before buildout of the proposed project. However, there are two long-term projects that
will increase transit service within the project vicinity in the few years after project occupancy.

The upcoming University District Link Station, located approximately 600 feet east of the site
on Brooklyn Avenue between NE 45th Street and NE 43rd Street, is projected to begin
service in 2021. It will serve the surrounding residential community, the commercial
businesses, the UW Tower and the north University of Washington campus. NE 45th Street is a

                                    Project Impacts
This section of the report documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street system and study intersections. First, traffic generated by the proposed project is
forecast, distributed and assigned to the adjacent roadways and intersections within the study
area for the weekday AM and PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-
project traffic volumes. Lastly, potential impacts to traffic operations, traffic safety, non-
motorized facilities, site access, parking, and transportation concurrency will be analyzed.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then estimating
the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment such as the University District, which typically has a
larger portion of trips served by alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given
the mix of development and level of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily, AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




Total person trips were developed for the proposed uses based on trip rates from the ITE’s
Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Average vehicle occupancy (AVO) was estimated from
the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel



                                                                                                  12

Estimating Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed office. Based on a review of
available literature, AVO data for walk-in banks is not readily available. Based on this, the
walk-in bank AVO was assumed to be equal to the 1.11 AVO used for the proposed office
land use.

Person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the total person
trips by the estimated mode splits from the U-District Urban Design Draft Environmental
Impact Statement.1 The report shows a 47 percent auto mode split for the generalized
“commercial” land use under the 2015 No Action Alternative in the University District. After
applying the auto mode split, person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by
assuming the same AVO from the NCHRP.

Appendix D provides the detailed trip generation calculation. Table 5 summarizes the
estimated weekday daily, AM, and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed land uses.
The existing site is vacant and no deductions for existing on-site uses were applied.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information


As shown in Table 5, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 590 net
new daily vehicle trips with 71 net new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 87 net new
vehicle trips during the PM peak hour.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based on guidance
from the U.S. Census Bureau’s OnTheMap tool. OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and
reporting application, which shows where workers in the area live based on census data.
Using this tool, the number of people that work within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and the zip codes where these workers live were evaluated to determine if a person
would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips to zip codes
closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more likely to use
transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City limits and/or
further from the site are more likely to drive. Although bank/credit union customers will likely
be attracted from the immediate vicinity of the project, using the same regional distribution for
both office and bank trips results in a conservative analysis of traffic operations impacts.

Figure 5 illustrates the expected project vehicle trip distribution for the proposed project, to
the surrounding local and regional street system. The weekday AM and PM peak hour trips
were assigned to the study area based on the travel patterns shown on Figure 5 and the
location of the site access.

Traffic Volume Impact
The project traffic was added to future without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic
volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2019 with-project traffic
volumes are shown on Table 6. This tableTable 6 summarizes the project traffic volume
impact at the study intersections during the weekday PM peak hour for the project site.

As shown, traffic volumes generally increase approximately two percent or less at the study
intersections as a result of forecast project generated traffic. Overall the project volume
impacts identified at the study intersections are within the range of daily fluctuations in traffic,
which can be up to 10 percent.


Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hour to
analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as
described for existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters
such as channelization and traffic control were consistent with those used in the evaluation of
future without-project conditions. A comparison of future without and with-project weekday
AM and PM peak hour traffic operations is summarized in Table 7. Detailed LOS worksheets
are provided in Appendix C.

1.   Level of Service (A – F) as defined by the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board.
2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3.   Worst movement reported for unsignalized intersections where NB = northbound, etc.
4.   Analyzed in HCM 2000 due to signal timing settings.


As indicated in Table 7, overall impacts to the signalized intersections would generally be
minimal with little to no change in calculated delays or LOS. Site access (alley access)
operations are further described in the following section.


Site Access Evaluation
As described previously, access to the underground garage will be provided by a driveway
located through the existing alley that extends between NE 45th Street and NE 43rd Street.

The alley / NE 45th Street intersection was analyzed under future with-project conditions and
was found to operate at LOS E and F during the AM and PM peak hours respectively with the
northbound approach as the worst operating approach. The assignment of project trips
assumed that all traffic would access the site via the alley intersection with NE 45th Street.

Should these delays be unacceptable to drivers, outbound project traffic could alternatively
travel southbound along the alley to NE 43rd Street, where traffic volumes are lower than
NE 45th Street. A sensitivity analysis was conducted assuming that all northbound left-turning
project traffic choose to depart the project via the alley at NE 43rd Street. This potential
diversion could improve alley operations at NE 45th Street to LOS B and LOS D for the AM
and PM peak hour respectively, while also maintaining good operations at the adjacent 11th
Avenue NE / NE 45th Street intersection (LOS B during both AM and PM peak hours).


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning

Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include Screenlines 13.13 and 6.15 as
shown in Table 8. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated
traffic traveling in the direction of the screenlines would extend across the screenlines
included in this analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the parking supply on and off-site in the project vicinity and
the estimated peak parking demand of the project.
On-Site Parking Supply
On-site parking will be provided in an underground parking garage providing 67 parking
stalls; 12 parking spaces would be reserved for WSECU bank customers, 16 parking spaces
reserved for WSECU bank employees, and the remaining 39 spaces available for the
remaining office uses in the proposed building. As noted previously, the garage is accessed
from the alley that extends between NE 45th Street and NE 43rd Street.
Parking Demand
The peak parking demand for the proposed project was estimated based on information
provided by WSECU, and available data provided in ITE Parking Generation (4th Edition)
with local office mode split data consistent with the trip generation analysis. As described for
the proposed supply, WSECU will reserve 28 parking spaces for their use; this is greater than
the peak parking demand forecast using ITE Parking Generation data. Parking demand rates
for the office land are consistent with previously approved traffic studies for other
developments located in the City of Seattle. Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix E
with a summary of the result shown in Table 9.

As shown in Table 9, the estimated peak parking demand is 96 vehicles and exceeds the
proposed on-site parking supply of 67 on-site parking stalls by 29 vehicles when taking into
account the WSECU reserved parking supply.
Off-Site Parking Supply & Occupancy
Because the forecast peak parking demand exceeds the on-site parking supply, off-site
parking supply and availability was reviewed.

An on-street parking utilization study using data from the 2015 Annual SDOT Paid Parking
Study2 to evaluate existing on-street parking supply and demand within an 800-foot walking
distance from the site. Based on Parking Generation (4th Edition) time of day parking
distributions, the peak parking for the combined bank and office use would likely occur at
approximately 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Note that two block faces south of the project site but within
the 800-foot walking distance were not available in this study. The parking on these two
blocks are unrestricted and conservatively not included in the parking supply.

In addition to project-related off-site parking, the 4230 11th Avenue NE pipeline development
of 99 studio units is not expected to provide on-site parking. Based on typical parking
demand calculations using census tract vehicle ownership data3, the development is
expected to have a peak parking demand of 46 vehicles. Considering residential parking
demand typically peaks during overnight periods, the Parking Generation time of day
distribution for low/mid-rise apartments would need to be considered and shows that as much
as 44 percent of peak parking residential parking demand, or 20 vehicles, occurs mid-day
and could occur at the same time as the WSECU development’s peak parking demand.

Table 10 summarizes the on-street parking supply and observed demand during the 2:00 to
3:00 p.m. period when project parking demand peaks.

The parking data showed an on-street parking supply 117 parking spaces and considering
pipeline development within the study area, on-street space for 41 vehicles at 2:00 p.m.
would be available without the proposed project. Note that nearly all on-street parking is
restricted to a maximum of 2 to 4 hours during daytime hours. The peak project parking
demand would add approximately 29 vehicles and could be accommodated by the available

supply for 41 vehicles. In addition, off-street daily paid parking lots4 are also available and
were analyzed within 800-feet walking distance from the site. Three paid parking lots were
identified with a total supply of approximately 235 parking stalls available for long-term daily
parking.

This analysis demonstrates that the available off-site parking supply can accommodate the
overspill parking demand from the project. The combination of off-site on and off-street
parking can server the overspill parking demand for either office or bank/credit union
customers.

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the bank and office
development located on the southwest corner of 12th Avenue NE and NE 45th Street in the
University District neighborhood of Seattle.

          The proposed project would develop approximately 8,130 square feet of ground
           floor walk-in bank with 58,300 square feet of general office located on the six floors
           above the bank. Access to the underground parking garage with 67 parking stalls
           would be provided via the adjacent alley.
          The development is anticipated to generate 590 net new vehicular weekday daily
           trips with 71 net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 87 net
           new trips during the PM peak hour.
          All of the off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better
           during the AM and PM peak hour with the addition of projected generated traffic.
          During with-project conditions, the NE 45th Street alley intersection is expected to
           operate at LOS E and LOS F during the AM and PM peak hour respectively. Drivers
           are expected to adjust their outbound routes accordingly to the experienced delays.
           Assuming that every outbound northbound left turn shifts southbound to NE 43rd
           Street and 11th Avenue, the alley intersection would operate at LOS B and LOS D
           during the AM and PM peak hour respectively. There would be minimal impact to
           the 11th Avenue / 45th Street intersection’s operations as a result.
          Project estimated peak mid-day parking demand would be 96 vehicles and exceeds
           the proposed on-site supply by 29 vehicles. Parking demand not accommodated
           on-site and could be accommodated by either the on-street parking available or
           paid parking lots within walking distance.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.

Appendix B:LOS Definitions
                                          Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

        C                     >20 - 35                Stable flow (acceptable delays)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
