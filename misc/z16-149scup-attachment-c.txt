                                                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
City of Spokane voters have supported the Spokane Parks Department by approving a $64.3-
million bond to provide substantial capital improvements for Riverfront Park; projected for
completion within 3 to 5 years (by year 2020). These capital improvements are anticipated to
nearly double park attendance throughout the year. However, special event attendance will
almost triple due to the number and density of events.

According to the Riverfront Park Master Plan 2014, improvements are anticipated to increase
Park activities from 45 to 50 current, major events per year to over 120 major events by year
2020. Event attendance is projected to increase from just fewer than 220,000 to nearly 600,000
persons per year with the addition of these events. The following Table highlights statistical
event characteristics for the existing Park (year 2014) and as projected by year 2020, as derived
from attendance information provided the Master Plan and City Parks Department officials.

The information is provided primarily on an attendance per event basis, but it should be noted
that major events can span days. It should also be noted that maximum, 85th percentile,
average, and median event statistics are not mutually exclusive, meaning smaller events are
reflected in larger event statics. Finally, maximum, 85th percentile, average, and median is
terminology used to describe statistical determination based on event attendances throughout
the year, and are not a function of total or even maximum attendances.

As shown, the 85th percentile attendance condition will include 25,000 persons occurring 8 times
per year by year 2020. The projected average attendance condition is anticipated to reach
11,300 attendees occurring 18 times per year. These events are highlighted because this
transportation study focuses on addressing traffic conditions during these timeframes. Of these,
the “average” attendance condition was addressed primarily throughout the report as it regards
traffic and parking. This is because, while the 11,300 attendees are statistically relevant as
“average” out of the 120 events projected by year 2020, this is closer to an 85th percentile
condition on the basis of attendance compared with 365 days of park activities during the year.

Thus it is more appropriate and relevant that traffic analyses addresses this more typical
condition throughout the year.

The 85th percentile statistical condition with 25,000 persons was used to guide the review of
pedestrian and bicycle facilities because the comfort and safety of citizens is of significant
concern to City officials. Thus, even though this attendance condition is less frequent, this was
appropriate and relevant in the recommendation of ped./bike facilities.

This traffic impact analysis (TIA) and design study was developed to review future year 2020
traffic conditions assuming full development of Riverfront Park. More specifically, this study was
developed to review peak generator hour traffic impacts, pedestrian activity, and parking
conditions assuming a special event condition anticipated to occur with some frequency
throughout the year; specifically, the average and 85th percentile attendance conditions
highlighted above.

TIA/TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The scope for the traffic impact analysis (TIA) was established in coordination with staff from
City Transportation Department. Per direction, the study reviews traffic and transportation
impacts for nine intersections located along roadways fronting or providing access to Riverfront
Park, including Spokane Falls Boulevard, Washington Street, Stevens Street, Post
Street/Lincoln Street, Boone Avenue, Mallon Avenue, Cataldo Avenue, and North River Drive.
Traffic counts were collected during the weekday AM and PM peak/commute rush hours of
these intersections.

The operational/capacity analysis was performed based on PM peak hour traffic volumes of a
typical weekday as they well exceed those identified for the AM peak hour (i.e. evening “rush
hour” volumes exceed those of the morning). Also, the impacts of the Park are anticipated to be
most significant in the afternoon versus morning, thus further supporting the use of a PM peak
hour analysis. Finally, as traffic volumes during the weekday PM peak hour exceed those
hourly volumes typically experienced during weekends within the City central business district
(CBD), this study should be sufficient for addressing traffic conditions throughout the majority of
a typical week.

Year 2020 traffic forecasts were developed from counts assuming a 10 percent baseline growth
rate (reflecting non-development growth) combined with trips generated by Riverfront Park. The
TIA concludes the Park is projected to generate a total of 1,423 peak generator hour trips during
the statistical average attendance and 85th percentile frequency activity day. Again, this
represents trip generation for the 11,300 attendees projected during the “average” condition of
the 120 events projected by year 2020, but is statistically relevant as the 85th percentile event
condition when compared to 365 attendance days of the year.

A summary of trip generation totals is shown below. This represents the trip generation of
active and passive park activities. Active activities include those generated by special event
activities, as derived/predicted from resources available from the Spokane Regional
Transportation Council, Spokane Transit Authority, and Visit Spokane. Passive activities
include general park activities occurring every day for Riverfront Park, as determined with the
Trip Generation Manual (ITE, 2012). Note that attendance and trip generation was segregated
into three specific areas of the Riverfront Park. This is because the Park is large enough to
generate different traffic impacts upon City streets, depending upon where activities occur.

Approximately 55 percent of trips are anticipated to approach and 45 percent depart the Park
during this timeframe. Overall via City arterials, 29 percent of Park trips are anticipated to/from
the north of Mission Avenue; 16 percent to/from the south of Interstate 90; 22 percent to/from
the west of the Maple/Ash couplet, and 33 percent to/from the east of the Division/Ruby couplet.

The resulting traffic forecasts are considered conservative for two primary reasons. First, traffic
growth within the CBD has been minimal throughout the last 10 years. Thus, the application of
the 10 percent growth rate is high in context to negative traffic growth trends, but was assumed
given the redevelopment and revitalization that has occurred within the CBD over the last few
years. Second, counts already reflect some park activity as they were collected in the field on
typical weekdays when Riverfront Park was in operation. Thus, there is some “double” counting
of trips as the entire 1,423 peak generator trips were assigned to study intersections for the TIA.

Operations/Capacity Analysis. A TIA evaluates roadway capacity primarily through an
examination of intersection operations.         Congestion and increased vehicle delays are
experienced more rapidly at intersections versus road segments (between intersections) due to
the number and frequency of conflicts (i.e. turning vehicles and stopping or slowing
movements). This study quantified traffic operations and capacity based on a review of level-of-
service (LOS) methodologies of the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board,
2010). The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) is a nationally recognized and locally accepted
method of measuring traffic flow and congestion for intersections. Criteria range from LOS A,
indicating free-flow conditions with minimal vehicle delays, to LOS F, indicating congestion with
significant vehicle delays (and operational failures).

The analysis was developed based on geometric and traffic control conditions noted in the field
(i.e. number of lanes, turn lane location, speeds, signals versus stop-signs, etc.); also using
Synchro data (traffic analysis files) provided by City staff which reflect signal timing and phasing
information currently used for these intersections. LOS D standard is desired for signalized
intersections and LOS E for unsignalized intersections within the Spokane CBD. As shown by
the following Table, forecast traffic operations are acceptable during the forecast year 2020
weekday PM peak hour as no intersection is projected to function below minimum acceptable
standards. This indicates that no roadway improvements are warranted on the basis of traffic
operations or capacity need.

With that said, two roadway improvements/modifications were examined as they were
highlighted by the Riverfront Park Master site plan, including:
    1) The reduction of a through lane on Spokane Falls Boulevard to allow for a landscape
        median and 45 degree parking between Washington Street and Post Street.
    2) The vacation of Cataldo Avenue for approximately 600 from Howard Street to just short
        of Washington Street reduce through traffic and promote site plan objectives.

An operations/capacity analysis concludes that these improvements/modifications would have
minimal impact upon traffic conditions noted in the Table above, with measures-of-effectiveness
(MOE) still within acceptable tolerances. In fact, as a recommendation of this report, the
vacation of Cataldo Avenue concept was expanded upon to incorporate a connection south to
the signalized Washington Street/North River Drive intersection in order to address a safety
issue noted in the field for special event conditions of Riverfront Park and the Spokane Arena
for the Cataldo Avenue/Washington Street intersection.

The recommended improvements are further described as follows.
    Spokane Falls Boulevard - This improvement includes a quasi-boulevard street concept
    between Washington Street and Post Street along Spokane Falls Boulevard. The proposal
    would reduce a westbound lane and parking lane from the arterial and construct a
    landscape median with 45 degree/angle parking fronting Riverfront Park; leaving two
    westbound lanes separated by the landscape median. The concept illustrated within the
    Riverfront Park Master Plan 2014 is shown below.

                                               Cataldo Vacation - The improvement includes the
                                               vacation of Cataldo Street eastward from Howard
                                               Street to approxiamtely 150 feet west of
                                               Washington Street to reduce through vehilce
                                               access and promote site development and parking
                                               objectives of Park officials. This improvement could
                                               shift traffic to Dean Avenue and Boone Avenue
                                               (aligned to the north); however, this could provide
                                               an opprotunity for Parks
                                               Department officials to tie
                                               Park traffic and other
                                               existing vehilce trips into
                                               the Washington
                                               Street/North River Drive
    intersection via public or private approaches that extend south and
    then east to tie into this signal. This could promote a vehilce
    “entery feature” for the Park. A screencapture of the traffic model
    for this improvement is shown left with the Riverfront Park Master
    Plan 2014 concept shown right.

PEDESTRIAN/TRANSIT CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
An analysis of pedestrian conditions was performed principally to help with the design of primary
walkways that provide access to/from and through the Park. Pedestrian analyses was
performed based upon 15-minute peak demands projected for the 85th percentile attendance
day of the Park, which exceeds the average attendance day noted for traffic. The higher
standard was used because pedestrian comfort and mobility is crucial for a successful Park
venture. With that said, the pedestrian volumes predicted are only anticipated to occur with up
to 8 events each year; thus, the conclusions derived this review is conservative throughout the
majority of the year. A 15-minute demand was reviewed because pedestrian densities are most
significant shortly following the release of a special event.

The analysis concluded that 15-minute demand up to10,500 pedestrian trips during the 85th
percentile attendance day. 29 percent of these pedestrians are anticipate to frequent event
facilities along the north bank of the park, 49 percent within the center of the Park, and 22
percent along the south bank. These pedestrians were distributed to access principally parking
surrounding Riverfront Park, with the general walkway width conclusions as follows:
     Howard Bridge South should have a 50 to 55 foot effective and total width
     Howard Bridge north should have an effective minimum width of 35 feet
     Major access and travel corridors should have an effective width of 30 feet, with a total
       width of up to 45 feet where vendor activities are anticipated.
     Minor access and travel corridors should have an effective width of 15 feet with a total
       width of up to 20 feet where sightseeing or similar activities are anticipated.
     Suspension bridges are adequate at a width of 10 feet; assume no construction of
       additional obstructions.

The pedestrian analysis also concludes that there are sufficient, controlled crossings providing
access to Riverfront Park across adjacent City arterials. This determination is made because

there is ¼ mile spacing or less between crossings on the primary pedestrian fronts of Riverfront
Park (to/from the CBD and north bank of the Spokane River).

There are no changes to transit warranted by this study. Spokane Transit Authority (STA)
officials confirm they will respond to any additional transit and shuttle needs on a case-by-case
basis. There are improvement options to enhance STA bus access to the Park that should
receive some additional consideration in the future. First, bus pullout lanes or turnaround
should be considered on the north and south entryways to the Park off Spokane Falls Boulevard
and North River Drive, respectively. These should be reduced cost enhancements that can be
implemented if and when Park officials elect to
construct recommended improvements.

Second STA officials have examined the potential for a
transit drop-off and pickup area to be situated between
the northbound and southbound arterials of the
Washington/Stevens Couplet. This would convert
underutilized traffic vehicle lanes into contra-flow transit
lanes that could drop pedestrians unto a “landing”
constructed on the Spokane River Bridge of the
couplet, just north of Spokane Falls Boulevard. An
elevator and/or stairway would extend to pedestrian
facilities below the bridge, providing access to the Park.
This improvement does improve centralized access to
the Park, but would be costly and would require
structural and environmental studies to support
feasibility. Thus, this is a long-term improvement
option. However, geometrically it does appear the
improvement is feasible as shown to the right.

PARKING CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Parking demands were developed for Riverfront Park based on the “average” attendance
conditions. For parking, it is important that sufficient parking can be established for the majority
of the year and for not the high attendance event conditions, less there be an abundance of
unused parking in the region. Parking generation was established from resources available from
the Spokane Regional Transportation Council, Spokane Transit Authority, and Visit Spokane

A parking generation of 1,685 vehicles is anticipated for the average attendance or 85th
percentile frequency activity day of the Park with 700 parking stalls in demand north of Spokane
River and 985 vehicles to the south. Parking generation on the basis of the focus areas
discussed previously is summarized below. Note parking demands for the Central Park area is
split between the north and south banks; reconciling the statement two sentences prior.

                                                   Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

Through field observation it was determined there are approximately 7,335 parking stalls
projected within 73 parking lots and ramps within a ¼ mile radius of Riverfront Park (including
700 parking stalls in designated Park lots). Through a review of parking utilization counts
performed for three weekdays and two Saturdays it was determined that parking is 49 percent
and 33 percent utilized for weekdays and Saturdays, respectively. There are 1,370 stalls
typically available north of Spokane River and 2,340 souths during the typical weekday, with
1,765 available north and 3,150 south during a typical Saturday.

The parking analysis confirmed adequate parking supply was available to accommodate
demands from Riverfront Park during the average attendance and 85th percentile frequency day
event. This indicates no additional parking facilities are needed immediately based on the
conclusions of this study.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The TIA and design study confirms that Riverfront Park can develop as proposed without
significantly impacting traffic, pedestrian, parking, and transit conditions as this study has
identified no transportation deficiencies.       As such, the improvements and strategies
recommended are not mitigating measures; rather they have been highlighted to further
advance mobility and safety within the Spokane CBD. City Parks and Transportation can work
to determine what, if any, of these recommendations can be implemented or if they should be
disregarded due to right-of-way issues, cost, etc.

                                         1 INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the traffic impact analysis (TIA) and design study prepared on behalf of
the Riverfront Park revitalization project in Spokane, Washington. The report provides a
summary of traffic, pedestrian/bicycle, and transit evaluations; recommending improvements,
strategies, and designs to assure the safe mobility of patrons as they access and travel
throughout the Park. The traffic/design study has been established based on the Riverfront
Park Master Plan 2014 prepared by City of Spokane Parks and Recreation department staff in
coordination with a significant stakeholder and consultant committee. This Master Plan is
intended to guide the redevelopment and expansion of the Park throughout the next 3 to 5 years
(completion anticipated by year 2020).

The TIA and design study was performed to support development and building permitting
processes for all phases of the park, and to help address State Environmental Policy Act
(SEPA) application and certification processes. The City of Spokane is the lead agency for this
project, with this project being reviewed internally by the Engineering Services and Planning
departments. Key secondary agencies and stakeholders include, but are not necessarily limited
to, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Spokane Transit Authority
(STA), and the Spokane Regional Transportation Council (SRTC).

1.1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Riverfront Park is a 100 acre community event center that, as described by the Master Plan is
“central to the history of Spokane and its Park system”. The park is historically significant for a
number of reasons. Native Americans gathered within the park area to fish at the falls. Pioneers
settled here and started the City of Spokane in the 1800s. The park area became a hub of
commerce via rail activity through the early half of the 1900s. Finally, rail yards were removed
and the site and river cleaned up so the property could be substantially redeveloped to host
1974 World Fair and Exposition. There have been a number of modifications and changes
made to the Park over the last 40 years, but nothing as significant as what is being programmed
currently by the Spokane Parks Department.

The Riverfront Park Master Plan 2014 highlights $100 million of capital improvements to
expand, revitalize, and enrich Riverfront Park. The first financial initiative was secured by
Spokane Parks Department officials by way of a $64.3 million bond approved by Spokane
voters in November 2014. This study principally addresses those park improvements assured
with the bond approved by voters with the associated attendance projections provided in a
following section; although some long term recommendations may ultimately confirm longer
range project priorities highlighted by the Master Plan as “Tier Two and Three” improvements
(such as a parking garage). These are ultimately latter priorities as the City of Spokane is
approximately $35.7 million short of total funding needed for the entire Master Plan.

Summarily, the $64.3 million bond was approved to help support the following capital
improvements and enhancements; identified as Tier one projects/priorities via the Master Plan:
     Two new pedestrian/bicycle promenades, newly          New public art;
        designated cycling lanes, and one promenade with    Four improved river overlook terraces with picnic
        improved fire and truck access;                      tables and benches;
       Two new plazas for events;                          Redevelopment of the Pavilion to include an event
       Four new grass meadows;                              center, stage, and seating for nearly 3,000 people;
       Two upgraded playgrounds;                           Additional Pavilion enhancements would include
       A new 1.5 acre regional playground;                  lighting, interactive media and storytelling installations,
                                                             energy efficiency, and public art;
       A new park tour train;

shown from the Riverfront Park Master Plan 2014.

1.2 ATTENDANCE
There are over 2.2 million visitors to Riverfront Park each year. Park improvements will better
serve and grow this base, with annual attendance anticipated to nearly double over the next 5
years. This will occur as a result of improved passive park recreational areas such as
playground, picnic and gathering center, and open areas. However a focus of the project is to
improve facilities in order to attract a higher number of event activities, both at the local level
and as a destination center for the Northwest. This will occur through the improvement of more
active generation centers such as attractions, rides, and the provision of new and/or improved
event and large gathering centers.

According to the Master Plan, improvements are anticipated to increase Park activities from 45
to 50 current, major events per year to over 120 major events by year 2020. Event attendance
is projected to increase from just fewer than 220,000 to nearly 600,000 persons per year with
the addition of these events. These events will create the highest traffic, pedestrian and parking
demand scenarios for Riverfront Park because of high attendance projections. As such, this
traffic study focuses in particular on transportation conditions during special events.

The Riverfront Park Master Plan provides event attendance projections following the Tier One
improvements highlighted above. Table 1 highlights statistical event characteristics for the Park
(year 2014) and as projected by year 2020 from the Master Plan. The information is provided
on an attendance per event basis, but it should be noted that major events can span days. For
instance, the maximum and 85th percentile events normally occur over two to four days with
such events including Bloomsday (3 days), Artfest (2 days), and the Independence Day
Celebration (2 days). The average and median events can occur over one to two days, with
representative activities including First Night, the Color Run, and the Royal Fireworks Concert.

It should also be noted that maximum, 85th percentile, average, and median event statistics are
not mutually exclusive, meaning the 85th percentile and maximum includes average and median
events. The maximum event includes the 85th percentile, average, and median, etc. Also,
maximum, 85th percentile, average, and median is terminology used to describe statistical
determination based on attendances noted/projected from all event conditions throughout the
year, and are not a function of total or even maximum attendances.

As shown, there are maximum and 85th percentile conditions with 10,800 or more attendees that
currently occur 5 times per year spanning two or three days. The 85th percentile attendance
condition will increase to 25,000 persons occurring 8 times by year 2020; also anticipated to
span two or three days during respective major events. The current average attendance
condition statistically has an attendance of 8,750 persons, as occurring over one to two days 6
times per year. The projected average attendance condition is anticipated to reach 11,300
attendees occurring over one to two days 18 times per year. Both the current and projected
median attendance is at 5,000 persons. Currently there are 13 median events per year,
projected to increase to 31 events by year 2020. Median events typically occur over a day.

The 85th percentile, average, and median attendances shown are again statistically significant
within the context of attendees/persons recorded or projected at major events, and not within
the context of the number of events that occur each year. In terms of event frequency, the 85th
percentile event is expected to occur only 8 times out of 120 projected major events per year.
Thus, this actually represents close to a 95th percentile condition in terms of frequency as 112
events would have attendance less than 25,000 persons. The average event is projected to
occur 18 out of the 120 total major events per year. This represents an 85th percentile condition
in terms of frequency, as the remaining 102 events per year would have attendance of less than
11,300 persons. Finally, the median would actually be a 75th percentile event as it occurs 31
out of 120 total major event times each year, with 89 of the remaining events having attendance
of less than 5,000 persons.
1.2.1 Primary Attendance Scenario
The purpose of a traffic study is to conservatively, but reasonably, address the demands of a
development proposal on transportation infrastructure; determining the improvements and
strategies needed to safely and effectively promote traffic, pedestrian/bicycle, and transit
mobility without providing excessive and underutilized capacity. This typically results in an
analysis of the commute peak hour (i.e. the peak hour of the work commute) or the peak
generator hour (i.e. hour of highest trip generation for a development) of a typical weekday. The
analysis of such conditions promotes capital infrastructure that addresses high/conservative
travel demands, but within the context of a typical weekday; precluding the construction of
excessive improvements which are costly and require significant right-of-way.


August	2015	                                                                                                                         Page	5	
	                                                             Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                    Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

The forecast “average” event conditions provides the balance sought for this transportation
analysis, similar to that of the condition analyzed for a typical traffic study. This event would
have 11,300 persons occurring up to 18 times per year for Riverfront Park, which is an 85th
percentile event on the basis of event days. Thus, this is a statistically relevant approach for
addressing traffic conditions as it does not result in excessive and infrequent demand travel
demand scenarios.

Conversely, the maximum and 85th percentile events are projected to occur 8 times per year
only and would result in abnormally high travel demands. The promotion of transportation
infrastructure to accommodate attendance scenarios of 25,000 persons (or greater) would result
in costly capacity improvements with expansive right-of-way footprints; underutilized for the
majority of the year (even spread out over two to four days). Thus, it is reasonable to plan for
the more moderated event condition highlighted above for the majority of this study; leaving 85th
percentile attendance as a secondary basis for reviewing pedestrian and parking design only.

Average Event/85th Percentile Day Condition. The study was principally developed to
address the travel demands of a one-day event scenario of 11,300 attendees for Riverfront
Park, reflecting use of both active and passive attraction areas. This could be a substantial one
day event were the majority of facilities were used throughout the Park or could represent some
combination of events occurring in one day. In terms of frequency, this analysis would be an
85th percentile day analysis that would address at least 102 out of 120 total major events
conditions anticipated throughout the year.

1.2.2 Assignment Areas
Transportation characteristics and impacts can vary depending upon the location of an event in
Riverfront Park. To address this, traffic generation, pedestrian trips, and parking assignment
projections were developed for a combined event condition that reflects activities occurring in
three different major areas or zones of the Park during a typical activity day. These separate
distribution and assignment zones are distinguished because traffic, transit, and
pedestrian/bicycles approach and departure activities are distinct, impacting different
transportation facilities, due to the size of the Park.

City Parks Department staff identified three primary zones for the Park including the north bank,
central park, and south bank. Essential facilities within the north bank include an event center,
picnic/congregation areas, and the regional playground. The central area includes the Pavilion
with an amphitheater, an event center, picnic/congregation areas, a large playground, and
substantial open space for congregating, temporary pavilions/exhibits, and other activities. The
south bank includes the Sky Ride, ice rink, carrousel, a large playground, and gateway water
features. Likely attendance was determined for each activity center within the north, central,
and south trip zones in coordination with Park Department staff. The results are shown on
Table 2, intended as a one day attendance projection using all distribution/assignment zones for
the Park in year 2020. These distribution/assignment zones are also illustrated on Figure 3.

As shown, the north bank would have an attendance of 3,300 persons, central park 5,500
persons, and the south bank 2,500 persons during this attendance day; totaling a park-wide
attendance of 11,300. Again, this attendance was reflected for both active and passive
attraction areas projecting a number of event activities occurring throughout the Park for a
typical activity day. However, this could very well be a single day attendance for a large event
hosted in which the majority of Park facilities were used; resulting in very similar impacts.

                               2 EXISTING CONDITIONS
This section describes existing traffic conditions within the project study area. Described are
study roadways, current traffic volumes, existing operations and capacity conditions, pedestrian
facilities, and transit routes within the study area.

2.1 ROADWAY NETWORK
The scope for the TIA was developed in coordination with City Transportation department staff.
Per coordination, the study reviews traffic conditions for Spokane Falls Boulevard, Washington
Street, Stevens Street, Post Street/Lincoln Street, Boone Avenue, Mallon Avenue, Cataldo
Avenue, and North River Drive, focusing on traffic operations for nine intersections located
within a quarter mile of the Park. These roads and intersections provide primary approach and
departure routes to/from the Park and experience the highest impact of site generated trips.

All City roadways have a legal and posted speed limit of 30 mph. There is sidewalk aligned
along one or both sides of these roadways. Further description of these arterials is as follows:
     Spokane Falls Boulevard. This is a one-way principal arterial with three westbound
        travel lanes extending between Division Street and Monroe Street. The road supports
        between 7,500 and 9,500 average daily traffic (ADT) within the project vicinity.
     Washington Street. This is a principal arterial within the study area. North of the
        Stevens Street merge, Washington Street is a two-way arterial with a four lane cross
        section supporting 18,100 ADT. South of the merge, Washington Street is the three-
        lane northbound arterial of the Washington/Stevens couplet that supports 12,200 ADT.
        Adjacent street parking is aligned along both sides of the roadway south of Spokane
        Falls Boulevard.
     Stevens Street. This is the southbound arterial of the Washington/Stevens couplet.
        Designated as a principal arterial, the roadway has a three lane cross section and
        supports up to 10,300 ADT.
     North River Drive. This is a two-lane and two-way roadway between Washington
        Street and Division Street with no street parking. The roadway supports 10,200 ADT
        and is classified as a principal arterial.
     Post Street/Lincoln Street. Post Street is one-way minor arterial that supports up to
        3,600 ADT north of Spokane Falls Boulevard. The roadway has been modified to
        support 45 degree, angled parking adjacent to City hall with 90 degree, parallel parking
        aligned along the opposite curb line. The roadway converts to Lincoln Street north of
        Bridge Avenue; extending as a north-south four lane roadway with no street parking.
     Boone Avenue. This two-way minor arterial supports between 8,500 and 9,200 ADT
        within the project study area. The roadway is either comprised of four travel lanes for
        eastbound and westbound traffic or five travel lanes (including a center turn lane) west of
        Washington Street. There is no street parking aligned along the roadway.
     Mallon Avenue. This is a three lane minor arterial (with a center turn lane). Adjacent
        street parking is aligned along both sides of the roadway and supports 2,100 ADT.
     Howard Street. A collector arterial, two-way roadway has a three lane cross section
        (with a center turn lane). There is no street parking and the road supports 2,600 ADT.

                                                                                                                   Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                                                                         Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	


         direction roadway has adjacent street parking. And although there is a reduced arterial
         designation, the roadway supports high levels of approach and departure traffic before
         and after events for Riverfront Park and the Spokane Arena.

As indicated, City Transportation staff requested that nine intersections be examined by this
study. A summary of existing intersection turn lane locations and traffic control conditions
(signal, one-way, two-way, or all way stops) is provided on Table 3. Shown are different traffic
movements at intersections and whether a turn lane is provided. Also indicated are traffic
control conditions for the intersection. Controls and lanes are denoted with an “X”. A “2”
indicates where a second shared or designated turn lane is aligned at an intersection.

2.2 TRAFFIC COUNTS
Traffic counts were collected specifically for this study on Wednesday May 6, 2015. Per the
direction of staff, counts were performed in the morning between 7:15 to 8:45 AM and in the
afternoon/evening between 4:15 PM to 5:45 PM in order to identify the AM and PM peak hours
of commute traffic activity for each intersection. The resulting AM peak hour was noted to occur
with some variance in count timeframes at study intersections. However, the PM peak hour was
noted to occur with most frequency between 4:30 and 5:30 PM.

Total entering volumes (TEVs) were compared between the AM and PM peak hours. The
comparison confirms that TEV are higher in the PM versus AM peak hour at all study
intersections. A summary of AM versus PM peak hour TEV is shown on Figure 4.

                      Figure 4. Comparison of TEV for Study Intersections

As discussed in the next section, this study focuses on transportation conditions during a peak
generator hour of the Park. From the comparison above, it was determine that a review of the
generator hour versus PM peak hour traffic volumes would assure a conservative analysis of
operations and capacity conditions. Figure 5 provides a summary of PM peak hour turn
movement counts for study intersections. Original count worksheets are provided in Technical
Appendix B.

Also, it should be noted that weekday volumes typically exceed traffic volumes on Saturdays
and Sundays within the Spokane Central Business District (CBD). As such, an evaluation of the
Park peak generator hour versus PM peak hour counts should be sufficient to address peak
operations/capacity demands versus any other hour of a typical week.

2.3 TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
A TIA evaluates roadway capacity primarily through an examination of intersection operations.
Congestion and increased vehicle delays are experienced more rapidly at intersections versus
road segments (between intersections) due to the number and frequency of conflicts (i.e. turning
vehicles and stopping or slowing movements). As indicated, per direction of City staff, this
study quantifies traffic operations and capacity based on a review of level of-service (LOS)
performed for the following intersections:



August	2015	                                                                           Page	11	
	      Washington Street/Boone Avenue
                                                                            Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                                  Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

                                                                     Post Street/Spokane Falls Boulevard
       Washington Street/Cataldo Avenue                             Lincoln Street/Mallon Avenue
       Washington Street/North River Road                           Lincoln Street/Broadway Avenue
       Washington Street/Spokane Falls Blvd                         Howard Street/Boone Avenue
       Stevens Street/Spokane Falls Boulevard

Again, the analysis was performed for the PM peak/commute hours of the typical weekday,
which is the highest hour of capacity demand on the local roadway network anticipated
throughout a typical week.

2.3.1 Methodology - Intersection Operations
Intersection capacity was evaluated using the level-of-service (LOS) methodologies of the
Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010). The Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) is a nationally recognized and locally accepted method of measuring traffic flow
and congestion for intersections. Criteria range from LOS A, indicating free-flow conditions with
minimal vehicle delays, to LOS F, indicating congestion with significant vehicle delays (and
operational failures).

LOS for a signalized intersection is defined in terms of the average control delay experienced by
all vehicles at the intersection, as measured over a specific time period such as a peak hour.
LOS for a one or two-way stop controlled intersection or driveway is the function of average
control delays experienced by vehicles in a particular approach or approach movement over a
timeframe such as a peak hour. Typically, the stopped approach or movement experiencing the
worst LOS is reported. Finally, LOS at an all-way stop-controlled intersection is defined by the
average control delays experienced by all vehicles at the intersection, as with signals, but the
LOS thresholds are associated with delays for unsignalized intersections.

Table 4 outlines the LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections from the Highway
Capacity Manual. As shown, LOS thresholds, as a function of delay, vary between signalized
and unsignalized intersections. This is because driver tolerances for delay have been
documented to be much higher at signalized versus unsignalized intersections.

LOS was determined for this study using Synchro Version 9.0, (Trafficware, 2015). This
software tool can apply the analysis methodologies of HCM 2010 and is a standard industry
software application that is accepted by the City for use. LOS D is the typical threshold for
signalized intersections within the City. LOS E is allowed at unsignalized driveways and
intersections. Signalized intersections exceeding LOS D and unsignalized intersections
exceeding LOS E may require mitigation to maintain or improve intersection operation.

2.3.2 Intersection Operations – Levels of Service
The LOS and capacity analyses were performed based on a review of the traffic volumes
summarized in Section 2.2 and the geometric conditions described in Section 2.1. Table 5
provides a summary of LOS for the PM peak hour. Also shown are average control vehicle
delays for each intersection. Note again, LOS and control delays for stop controlled
intersections are the function of the worse approach or movement. Traffic signal settings for
study intersections were provided in Synchro files by City officials. These files include phase
splits, all-red and yellow times, pedestrian timing data, additional vehicle passage and gaps, etc.

As shown, all study intersections currently function within acceptable LOS ranges. This
indicates that no capacity improvements would be warranted on the basis of existing traffic
operations, as there is sufficient roadway capacity. LOS summary worksheets are provided in
Section C of the Technical Appendix.

2.4 PEDESTRIANS

roadways. Figure 6 shows the crossings highlighted above in relation to the Park. A summary
of marked crosswalks and pedestrian crossings are located at the following locations:
       Mallon Avenue Crossing at Post Street (marked crossing, no controls),
       Mallon Avenue midblock Crossing (marked crossing, no controls),
       Mallon Avenue Crossing at Howard Street (marked crossing, no controls),

       Lincoln Street/Bridge Avenue intersection (marked crossing, no controls), and
       Lincoln Street/Broadway Avenue (marked and signalized crossing).

Pedestrian counts were performed for the nine study intersections identified above. These
counts were performed to gain a sense of pedestrian and bicycle activity surrounding Riverfront
Park. A summary of total crossing counts for study intersections is provided in Table 6 for the
AM and PM peak hours.

As shown, a total of 357 pedestrians were counted at study intersections during the AM peak
hour with 912 during the PM peak hour. Pedestrian activity in the PM peak hour is therefore
approximately 2.5 times that of activities noted during the AM peak hour. This confirms the
priority of reviewing PM over Am peak hour conditions on the basis of pedestrian counts as well.

2.5 TRANSIT
Spokane Transit Authority (STA) operates public transit within Spokane. There are a number of
transit stops located within direct vicinity of Riverfront Park (within an approximate 1/8 mile
walking distance). Figure 7 highlights these 23 stop locations (neglecting the plaza), and also
the bus route and direction of bus travel. Based upon information provided by STA staff, there
are 1,480 persons that board and depart buses at these stops on a typical day.

The routes noted from Figure 7 provide expansive access throughout the City of Spokane. All
routes access the Spokane STA Bus Plaza. Thus, access to the remaining areas of Spokane
and the region can be achieved through the Bus Plaza. A summary of information for bus
routes operating and accessing 1/8 mile bus stops, including primary stops, routes of operation,
times of operation, and headway (rotation/cycle) information is summarized as follows:

                     3 FUTURE 2020 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
This section summarizes year 2020 future traffic conditions anticipated following the completion
of Riverfront Park improvements. Described are future traffic volumes, forecast traffic
operations and capacity, and reviews two improvement options/alternatives being considered
with the Park. Forecast pedestrian, transit, and parking conditions are summarized in Section 4
and 5.

3.1 TRAFFIC FORECASTS
Year 2020 traffic forecasts were comprised of a baseline growth rate and the trips generated by
the proposed development. Baseline traffic growth was determined through a comparison of
average daily traffic (ADT) for count locations located along Washington Street, Stevens Street,
Spokane Falls Boulevard, Monroe Street, Lincoln/Post Street, Howard Street, Mallon Avenue,
and Boone Avenue. This data was available from historical count maps provided from the City
of Spokane Street department. Historical counts are available on a bi-annual basis between
1998 and year 2012. A summary of this comparison is provided on Figure 8.




         Figure 8. Comparison of Average Daily Traffic (ADT) Counts for City Roadways

A trend-line analysis was provided for all of the locations identified above. As shown above, the
trend-lines indicate a negative growth trend over the 12 year analysis/review timeframe. This
suggests traffic growth should be minimal over the next five years. Despite this, a 10 percent
growth rate was used to forecast baseline year 2020 traffic volumes for the PM peak hour of the
typical weekday. The growth was assumed given the redevelopment and revitalization that has
occurred within the CBD over the last few years, suggesting growth is likely to occur, and also to

National resources such as the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation
Manual (9th Edition, 2012) does not contain a land use that addresses the travel traits of an
activity center such as Riverfront Park. Land Use 417 does describe the travel characteristics of
a “Regional Park” and, as described later, this will be used as a trip “overlay” to address passive
activities of the Park. However, this does not address the varying trip generation activities of the
attendees described in Table 2.

As such, trip generation was derived based on the attendance projections and travel information
gathered from the SRTC, STA, and concept reports available from Parks Department staff.
Specifically, the following resources were used in the development of park trip estimates:
   1. Spokane and Kootenai County Regional Travel Survey (STRC/KMPO, 2005)
   2. Performance Report - Passenger Facilities (STA, 2014)
   3. Visit Spokane 2012 Tourism Research Study (RTM, 2012)

Using these reports (referenced throughout), the process used in estimating trip generation is
described in the following sections for the statistical average attendance day.

Travel Mode Split
Attendees are anticipated to access the park by transit, walking and biking, shuttles or taxi, and
by personal autos. Described here are mode split assumptions for the park study activity day.

Transit Trips. As indicated earlier, the STA Performance Report (Ref. 2) indicates there are
1,480 persons that board and depart buses at 23 bus stops surrounding Riverfront Park each
typical day. The destinations and origins of persons at these stops can vary, but for the purpose
of this study it was assumed that 50 percent of travelers would access Riverfront Park for a total
of 740 entering and exiting riders. These could represent different persons, but it is more likely
that the same people will depart and get back on buses in one round trip. Thus, it is expected
this really calculates to approximately 370 attendees of Riverfront Park.

As indicated in Section 1.2, there are 2.2 million people that visit the Park each year, which is an
average of about 6,025 people each day. The number of transit stop riders was compared with
this average to estimate a 6.1 percent ridership of attendees on an average attendance day.
However, as this study proposes to review a more robust day in terms of attendance, this was
rounded up to assume a 10 percent ridership projection.

Note this is high compared with the Regional Travel Survey (Ref. 1) and Research Study (Ref.
3), which both indicate transit comprises 2 percent of Spokane County person trips. However,
given this is a special designation center with event potential in downtown Spokane, the use of
a 10 percent ridership is expected to be reasonable; especially in context to the goals of
Spokane Parks Department staff to increase dependency on STA for Riverfront Park travel in
the future. This assumption was corroborated with staff from STA, who indicate this could
approach even 15 percent for certain event activities. Thus, a 10 percent assumption provides
balance between “typical” and peak potentials during the projected attendance day.

Walking/Bicycle Trips. The Regional Travel Survey (Ref. 1) indicates that walking and bicycle
activities accounts for 10 percent of typical commute travel and 25 percent of “recreational”
travel within Spokane County. Residential densities within downtown are reduced, thus
minimizing the application of the recreational rates. However, there are a number of businesses
and hotels nearby with employees and patrons who enjoy recreational activities and attend
events at the park. As such, the application of the commute rate does not seem appropriate


August	2015	                                                                               Page	20	
	                                                              Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                     Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

either. Therefore, a 20 percent bike/walk rate was assumed as the balance point between the
guidance provided within the Regional Travel Survey (Ref. 1).

Shuttle/Taxi. Guidance on these travel modes is limited within the references described.
However, there is a high potential for shuttle and taxi activities as attendees will stay in hotels
and/or choose this mode versus personal automobile to visit the Park. As such, a 5 percent
Shuttle/Taxi rate was assumed for this study.

Personal Automobiles. Transit, walk/bike, and Shuttle/Taxi are projected to account for 35
percent of person trips for a study activity day. This leaves 65 percent of person trips as those
performed using personal autos. The Research Study (Ref. 3) concludes there is a 63 percent
“automobile only” travel rate for tourism in Spokane. While there is some ambiguity regarding a
correlating “combination fly/drive” category in the report (travelers fly to Spokane and then drive,
shuttle, taxi, or transit to hotels or to events), the fact this number correlates well with the 65
percent assumption highlighted above does provide some support and justification for its use.

Person Trips
Person trip totals reflect the number of times an attendee is expected to access Riverfront Park
during a typical event day. Person trips were determined by applying a factor of 2.5 to
attendance numbers for the travel modes identified above. This includes one inbound and one
outbound trip per attendee, with a 25 percent margin to account for inbound/outbound trips
associated with employees, deliveries, lunch-runs, etc.

Vehicle Occupancy
Vehicle trips were projected next for shuttle/taxi service and for personal automobiles, as
determined following the determination of vehicle occupancy rates. Transit operates on fixed
routes currently reflected in traffic counts. Thus, the person trips associated with this travel is
simply absorbed into the system with no gain in traffic anticipated. Note it is possible that future
operations at Riverfront Park may alter or even increase transit service to the area, but this is
something that will be vetted through the traffic/design study in coordination with STA staff.
Regardless, any such changes would be the diversion or gain of a few trips per hour and would
not really impact the trip generation conclusions of this memorandum.

Similar to transit, pedestrian trips would not result in a gain in traffic as these would include
walkers and bikers traveling between the park and downtown residences, businesses, hotels, or
nearby shopping centers (such as Riverpark Square). While ultimately some vehicle trips may
be associated with these pedestrian person trips, such as vehicle trips to/from the land use
describe above, access to the park is not the primary purpose and therefore is not counted as
positive trip generation. Rather, they are vehicle trips generated by the downtown residences,
businesses, hotels, or shopping center described above.

Shuttle/Taxi. Again, guidance regarding vehicle occupancy rates for shuttles and taxis is
limited within the references described. A taxi may have typical vehicle occupancy rates of two
or three persons for events, whereas a shuttle may have occupancy rates of up to six persons
for the same event. As such, a 4 person vehicle occupancy average was assumed for
Shuttle/Taxi services for this study (besides the driver).

Personal Automobiles. The Research Study (Ref. 3) indicates the following information:
 78.80 percent of visitors have an average party size of 2.17 adults without children.
 There is an average of 2.21 children traveling with 21.20 percent of visitors to Spokane.



August	2015	                                                                               Page	21	
	                                                              Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                     Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

The statistical average of this results in an average party size of 2.64 persons (calculation:
0.788 * 2.17 + 0.212 * [2.17+2.21]). This party size was used as the vehicle occupancy rate for
personal automobiles of Riverfront Park. Granted, this is a rate for “tourism” activities, but it
equates very identically to activities associated with the park. Be it a visitor from out of town or
a local, the pattern of visitation for the park is that typically of adult parties and/or families
looking to frequent venues, events, and activities. Thus, this was determined to be a
reasonable automobile occupancy rate for this study.

Passive Trip Totals
The procedure described so far has been focused on the activity centers highlighted throughout
the park on a typical event day (i.e. event centers, playground, concerts, Sky Ride, carrousel,
etc.). These have been labeled “active” event activities previously in this study for the Park.
However, there are also a number of passive activities expected during a typical event day.
These would include people attracted to the park for walks, picnic activities, feeding ducks, etc.
outside of the event center. This has been labeled previously as “passive” activities.

The day trip total for passive activities was developed based on rates provided within the ITE
Trip Generation Manual. Land Use 417 describes the travel characteristics of a “Regional Park”
and the trips identified for a 100 acre Park for the top generation day, which was a Sunday
based on rates from the Manual, was “overlaid” onto attendance trips to round out total trip
generation. The rate specified was 6.44 vehicle trips per acre, which equals about 650 daily
trips. About 15 percent of these trips were assigned to the north bank, 60 percent central park,
and 25 percent south bank based on a rough comparison of acreage for these areas.

Daily Trip Generation
The steps for developing daily trip totals for this project, from the information provided
previously, is summarized as follows:
     A mode split of 10 percent transit, 20 percent pedestrian and bicycle, 5 percent shuttle
       and taxi, and then 65 percent personal automobile was determined for the 11,300 event
       attendees projected for the average event day in year 2020.
     A 2.5 factor was applied to mode-separated attendees to determine person trip totals for
       transit, pedestrian/bicycle, shuttle/taxi, and personal automobile trip types.
     Vehicle occupancy rates were then used to estimate trip totals for the average event
       day, assuming 4 persons per shuttle/taxi and 2.6 persons from person trip totals.
     The trips estimated from the ITE were included to reflect passive trip totals for the
       different distribution/assignment zones of the park.
     Finally, as it is “best practice” to moderately overestimate trips (versus under), as to
       assure traffic issues are appropriately vetted, a 10 percent safety factor was applied to
       develop the final recommended trip totals for the traffic/design study.

Trip generation was projected for the event day based on the process described. A summary
of process calculations and the resulting trip totals proposed with the traffic/design study for
each zone/area of Riverfront Park is summarized on Table 7.

As shown, a total of nearly 8,890 trips would be generated by Riverfront Park on the statistical,
average attendance day. This would represent 85th percentile trip generation on the basis of
frequency.

Peak Generator Hour Trip Generation
A peak generator hour is the timeframe of highest trip generation for a land use. The Regional
Travel Survey (Ref. 1) indicates peak generation for outdoor activities is typically 14 percent
during a typical weekday. A review of ITE information for Land Use 417 indicates this can be as
high as 16 percent. Thus, to generate a conservative analysis of forecast traffic, the peak
generator hour was anticipated to experience 16 percent of activity day trips.

A review of inbound and outbound distribution data for ITE Land Use 417 indicates a moderate
emphasis on outbound versus inbound trips during the peak generator hour. Thus, a 45 percent
inbound and 55 percent outbound distribution was assumed for the peak generator hour. A
summary of peak generator hour trips is provided on Table 8 for the three park analysis zones.

As shown, the park is projected to generate a total of 1,423 peak generator hour trips during the
statistical average attendance and 85th percentile frequency activity day.

3.1.2 Trip Distribution & Assignment
As indicated, a total of 8,890 daily trips and 1,423 peak generator trips would be generated
during the statistical average attendance and 85th percentile frequency activity day of the
Riverfront Park. The distribution and assignment of trips was estimated as an initial impact
assessment to help identify where volume changes may occur on arterial and highway
approach routes to/from Riverfront Park.

To predict trip distributions, an imaginary cordon or screen line was assumed around the area
approximately one mile from the site intersecting the arterials of:
      To/From North                                       To/From North
     Maple Street/Walnut Street couplet,                Maple Street/Ash Street couplet,
     Lincoln Street/Monroe Street couplet,              Monroe Street,
     Stevens Street/Washington Street couplet,          Lincoln Street & Post Street,
     Division Street/Browne Street couplet,             Howard Street,
      To/From East                                       Washington Street,
     Mission Avenue,                                     To/From West
     Sharp Avenue,                                      Division Street/Ruby Street couplet,
     Spokane Falls Boulevard,                           Maxwell Avenue
     Martin Luther King Way,                            Riverside Avenue,
     Sprague Avenue,                                    2nd Avenue/3rd Avenue,
     2nd Avenue/3rd Avenue.                             Interstate 90.

Individual average daily traffic (ADT) counts, as obtained from City of Spokane 2012-2013 traffic
flow map, were compared along this cordon line to gain a sense of how commuters are
approaching, departing, and traveling through the study area (as defined via volume densities).

Trip distributions were initially proportioned to primary approach routes based on                the
comparison of ADT volumes. Some adjustments (rounding) were performed and the                     trip
projections were compared with distributions to forecast trip assignments throughout              the
Spokane CBD. The resulting distributions and trip assignments are shown on Table 9 for            the
activity day and peak generator hour.

As discussed earlier, Riverfront Park is large enough to have three principal origin and attraction
zones, defined early as the north bank, central park, and south bank. Thus, the overall
distributions identified by Table 9 will be routes such that 28 percent of project trips will
approach and depart the north bank, 50 percent central park, and 22 percent the south bank.

Note that project distributions and assignments were essentially assumed directly to/from
Riverfront Park to assure the highest impact of site trips on study intersections. However, trip
assignments will likely taper off as drivers find parking facilities to divert to/from in-route to the
Park. This full assignment assures a conservative analysis of traffic impacts as full assignments
are being reviewed within the study area.

The information summarized on Table 9 reflects the distribution of trips throughout Spokane
CBD. The relative distribution and impact of project trips within the CBD is shown on Figure 9.
The magnitude of these impacts have been color-coded, ranging in density from less than a 5
percent trip distribution (with assignment of less than 71 generator trips) to greater than a 30
percent distribution (with assignment of over 428 generator trips) to a major CBD intersection

As indicated, the City requested that this study specifically address project impacts at nine
intersections located within the vicinity the Park. Specific project assignments were developed
for these intersections with the resulting assignments shown on Figure 10 for the PM Peak hour.
Assignments per analysis zone are shown separately in Section D of the Technical Appendix.

Project trip assignments were then combined with baseline forecasts (again developed from
counts using a 10 percent growth rate) to generate year 2020 traffic volumes, as shown on
Figure 11 for the PM peak hour. Note there are existing daily activities at Riverfront Park,
occurring while counts were performed. As such, some “double counting” of traffic is expected
as assignments were combined with counts that already reflect Park activities; thus, assuring a
conservative analysis of forecast traffic conditions.

LOS and capacity analyses were performed based on a review of traffic forecasts, as
summarized in Section 3.1. As no major roadway improvements or significant signal
modifications are proposed initially within the study area, these traffic forecasts were compared
with the road geometrics and traffic control conditions described in Section 2.1. Table 10
provides a summary of resulting future with project LOS and control delays for the PM peak
hour (including peak generator hour trips).


                                Table 10. Year 2020 LOS and Delay - PM Peak Hour
                  Intersection                               LOS1             Delay
                  Washington St/Boone Ave                      B              14.4
                  Washington St/Cataldo Ave                    D              25.7
                  Washington St/North River Rd                 B              18.9
                  Washington St/Spokane Falls Blvd             C              33.9
                  Stevens St/Spokane Falls Blvd                B              18.1

                  Lincoln St/Mallon Ave                        B              15.3
                  Lincoln St/Broadway Ave                      B              11.9

                  1   LOS = Levels-of-Service


As indicated, a minimum LOS D standard is desired for signalized intersections and LOS E for
unsignalized intersections within the Spokane CBD. As shown, the assignment of peak
generator hour trips would not unacceptably impact traffic operations. No intersection is
expected to function below minimum acceptable standards, with project trips and baseline traffic
growth causing only a moderate increase of average control delays. This indicates that no
roadway improvements are warranted on the basis of traffic operations or capacity need.

3.3 IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS
Spokane Parks and Recreation Department staff requested that two specific roadway
improvement/modification options be reviewed as a function/extension of Park development.

Spokane Falls Boulevard
The first improvement would essentially create a quasi-boulevard street concept between
Washington Street and Post Street along Spokane Falls Boulevard. The proposal is to reduce a
westbound lane and parking lane from the arterial and construct a landscape median with 45
degree/angle parking fronting Riverfront Park.     The improvement would potentially require
some modification of traffic signals at the intersections of Spokane Falls Boulevard with
Washington Street, Stevens Street, Howard Street, Wall Street, and Post Street to
accommodate the proposal (essentially realignment or reduction of luminaries); potentially with
diverge and merge approach extending between the Washington Street/Spokane Falls
Boulevard and Post Street/Spokane Falls Boulevard to accommodate the proposal. The
concept from the Riverfront Park Master Plan site plan is highlighted below.


August	2015	                                                                                Page	29	
	                                                                   Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                          Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	




Operational/Capacity Impact. The improvement proposal is not expected to signifcantly alter
travel patterns for Riverfront Park. As such, the improvement/modification was reviewed in
Synchro assuming the reduction of a through/westbound travel lane with the majority of through
volumes operating on two lanes; albeit separated by the landscape median. The best
approximation of the separted lane in Synchro was to reduce Spokane Falls Boulvard to two
through lanes between Washington Street and Stevens Street, and then add a fifth apporach to
the Stevens Street and Post Street intersections to approximate lane speration. A summary of
revised LOS for impacted intersections is provided on Table 11.


                           Table 11. Year 2020 LOS/Delay w/Spokane Falls Two Lane
                                         Modification - PM Peak Hour
                  Intersection                             LOS1             Delay
                  Washington St/Spokane Falls Blvd           C              34.0
                  Stevens St/Spokane Falls Blvd              B              19.9
                  Post St/Spokane Falls Blvd                 D              38.6
                  1   LOS = Levels-of-Service


As shown, acceptable LOS can still be maintained at impacted study intersections with the
street proposal. The Post Street/Spokane Falls intersection is projected to degrade to LOS D
with the proposed modification without signal cycle or phase adjustements (using current City
signal settings). However, the use of signal cycle/phase optmization would improve operations
back to LOS C, which minimizes the impact of the improvement/modification proopsal.

As a secondary comparison, a transportation planning industry guideline is a through lane on a
City principal arterial has a practical capacity of between 700 to 1,000 vehicles in an hour. This
proposal reduces Spokane Falls Boulevard from three to two lanes which has a practical
capacity of between 1,400 to 2,000 vehilces in an hour according to planning practices. There
is just over 800 PM peak hourly trips projected on Spokane Falls Boulvard by year 2020. Thus,
the cross section proposal should be sufficent to accommodate forecast traffic volumes
throuhgout the majority of a typical year.

Cataldo Avenue Vacation
The second improvement option includes the vacation of Cataldo Street eastward from Howard
Street to approxiamtely 150 feet west of Washington Street to reduce through vehicle access
and promote site development and parking objectives of Park officials. This improvement could
shift traffic to Dean Avenue and Boone Avenue (aligned to the north); however, this could
provide an opprotunity for Parks Department officials to tie Park traffic and other existing vehilce

trips into the Washington Street/North River Drive intersection via public or private approaches
that extend south and then east to tie into this signal.

                                                   As indicated, the intersection currently
                                                   functions at LOS B and is projected to
                                                   function near LOS C by year 2020 during the
                                                   PM peak hour following Park development.
                                                   This is a typical PM peak hour condition that
                                                   demonstrates adquate LOS despite forecast
                                                   traffic growth. However, this intersection
                                                   experiences significant traffic congestion
                                                   prior to and following special events for
                                                   Riverfront Park and the Spokane Arena.
                                                   Queues have been noted to extend well west
                                                   by citizens of the community with vehicle
                                                   delays and wait times that can last several
                                                   minutes prior to turning onto Washington
                                                   Street. In addition, the west leg of the
                                                   Washington Street/Cataldo Avenue
                                                   intersesction is offset from the east leg such
                                                   that there is a conflict of head-to-head left
                                                   turns entering Washington Street from
                                                   Cataldo Avenue. This reprsents a safety
                                                   issue during a typical weekday, let alone
                                                   during special events.

                                                   Therefore, it is recommended Spokane Parks
                                                   and Recreation department officials continue
                                                   their intitative to vacate the identified section
                                                   of Cataldo Avenue. This would address the
                                                   safety issue and shift traffic to other
                                                   intersections. Secondly, it is recommended
                                                   that Park officials work to adapt the site’s
                                                   internal private or public approach network
                                                   such that traffic can access the North River
                                                   Drive traffic signal on Washington Street.

                                                   A summary of the current proposal from the
                                                   Riverfront Park Master Plan site plan is
                                                   shown top left. A simulation of the modified
                                                   proposal is shown bottom left, as modeled in
                                                   Synchro. The buildings and trees are
                                                   simulated facilties and enhancements
                                                   available from Synchro 3-D modeling.

With this proposal, it is anticipated the majority of west Cataldo Avenue traffic would shift to
North River Drive. An analysis with combined traffic volumes indicates Washington Street/North
River Drive would function within the LOS D range with 51.6 seconds of average control/vehilce
delay during the high attendance scenario. This assumes no signal cycle or phase optimization.

                              4 PEDESTRIAN & TRANSIT
This section provides a summary of pedestrian analysis and transit discussions in relation to the
proposed development of Riverfront Park. Described is the pedestrian capacity methodology
used for this study followed by trip generation and assignment projections and then discussion
on recommended parkway widths. An assessment of crossing adequacy is provided followed
by a discussion of transit conditions for Riverfront Park.

4.1 PEDESTRIAN CAPACITY
Pedestrian capacity refers to the number of persons that can pass a specific point (or through a
specified area), typically within a defined timeframe such as a minute, hour, day, etc. Effective
walkway width refers to the unobstructed area for pedestrian travel. This is not to be confused
with total walkway width, as effective width can be compromised with obstructions such as
vendor booths, designated bike areas, benches, trees, light standards/poles, and garbage cans;
all of which serve to narrow a clear walkway area.

Pedestrian capacity was principally determined based on methodologies outlined within the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM); which relates space occupied, flow rate, or walking speed to
various levels-of-service thresholds. In the context of this discussion, LOS is a term used to
quantify the quality of pedestrian mobility; referring ability of pedestrians to comfortably,
successfully, and safely travel sidewalk and pathway routes as the measure of capacity.

Pedestrian capacity criterial range from LOS A to LOS F. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)
refers to these grades as follows:
        LOS A. Ability to move in desired path, no need to alter movement
        LOS B. Occasional need to adjust path to avoid conflicts
        LOS C. Frequent need to adjust path to avoid conflicts
        LOS D. Speed and ability to pass slower pedestrians restricted
        LOS E. Speed restricted, very limited ability to pass slower pedestrians.
        LOS F. Speed severely restricted, frequent contact with other users.

While LOS A or B sounds “ideal”, it is actually quite restrictive in highly utilized destination
and/or event centers. This is because an extensive effective width of facilities would have to be
promoted in order to maintain these high LOS grades. This results in costly improvements with
pedestrian facilities (sidewalks and pathways) that occupy high levels of right-of-way,
detrimental especially to a regional park where open space, landscape, and view corridors
should be preserved. Conversely, LOS E or F is not desired throughout the majority of a year
because comfort and enjoyment is significantly deteriorated to the point of frustration for the
typical pedestrian over congested facilities.

Therefore, it is typical and recommended that a LOS C or D standard be promoted for Riverfront
Park. This provides a balance between excessive facility development and the pedestrian
congestion and frustration associated with oversaturated walkways. However, it is NOT
suggested this be a standard applied unilaterally for the entire year; rather it only be applicable
for more typical and even moderately higher attendance conditions. The provision of sidewalk
and pathway facilities to meet a LOS C/D standard during peak event conditions such as

	                                                               Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                      Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

Bloomsday, the Independence Day celebration, or “Pig Out” in the park again results in the
construction of pedestrian routes with excessive and costly right-of-way widths that ultimately
are underutilized throughout the majority of the year. People understand and anticipate the
quality of mobility will diminish during these peak activities, and are therefore more apt to
tolerate such conditions and will continue to frequent the Park, so long as such conditions do
not prevail throughout the year.

LOS Criteria. Table 23-1 of the HCM defines base average flow LOS criteria for walkways,
presenting LOS ranges based on average space per person, flow rate per person per minute,
and average walking speed of travel. The criteria used for this report was adapted from Table
23-1 in order to present LOS C and D thresholds in terms of pedestrians per effective walkway
widths and person-flow within a 15-minute timeframe. Pedestrians per effective width were
provided as a means for helping to confirm cross section of sidewalk and pathways. The 15-
minute flow rate is used to review peak event approach and departure volumes for the primary
pedestrian access points and through ways.

Some of the assumptions used in adapting this HCM Table 23-1 to the resulting Riverfront Park
LOS criteria are as follows:
      A forward spatial bubble of 6 feet (between pedestrians) was assumed in converting
        pedestrian space thresholds to the number of pedestrians per effective width section.
        This spatial bubble represents the typical following distance of persons before or
        following special event activities, as was based on information provided within a Guide
        for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities (ASSHTO, 2004).
      The LOS space-per-person thresholds from HCM Table 23-1 was divided by the
        forward spatial assumption above; resulting in a comfortable average lateral spacing of
        4 feet between persons and objects for the LOS C range and 2.5 feet for the LOS D
        range. For instance, one person would have a shoulder to shoulder average lateral
        spacing of 2.5 feet with a forward special bubble of nearly 6 feet to maintain a
        pedestrian LOS D standard.
      A body ellipse of 2 feet wide by 1.5 feet long was assumed for a typical pedestrian, per
        the HCM. This factor was considered important in establishing effective width sections
        in coordination with the lateral spacing LOS information identified above.
      Finally, “ideal” LOS A conditions and the associated pedestrian flow rate were based
        on a minimum walking speed of 4.25 feet per second. This represents travel on
        unimpeded pedestrian routes, which is less realistic for Riverfront Park. This average
        walking speed will be inhibited by a population of directional conflict (people walking
        toward each other), the slower walk of elderly pedestrians and youth, stopped or
        meandering sightseers and recreational pedestrians, bicycle and skateboarder
        conflicts, street exhibitions (entertainers), and other similar obstructions. It is therefore
        anticipated that flow rates would be less than the ideal scenario presented in HCM
        Table 23-1, and a 40 percent reduction was applied to generate more realistic flow
        rates for a park with distractions and obstructions.

The resulting LOS C and LOS thresholds for Riverfront Park pedestrian facilities are highlighted
in Table 12. These thresholds are presented in terms of persons that can be accommodated for
various effective walkway widths for the LOS C and LOC D thresholds. They are also
presented in terms of 15-minute flow widths for various effective walkway widths.

There are objects that limit effective width along pedestrian routes. Light poles, park benches,
garbage cans, sign poles, trees, and fire hydrants all restrict the effective width of the walkway,
beyond what one would typically think, as pedestrians tend to give wide berth to these objects
(due to comfort and special bubbles). Parks department officials must consider the impact of
these objects upon effective walkway widths, as they will compromise pedestrian LOS and
capacity, and these impacts should be minimized or walkway widths widened to accommodate.
A summary of various and typical objects within a regional park are summarized on Table 13.

Nearly all attendees will be pedestrian trips of Riverfront Park despite the means/mode of
approaching and departing travel. Pedestrians must walk to/from transit or parking facilities to
access the park. The majority of transit stops and parking lots are on the periphery of the park
and, as such, there will be significant demand put on admitting sidewalks and trails.

Pedestrian trips were projected in two steps similar to that used for vehicle trips. Attendance
was multiplied by 2.5 person trips to reflect one primary inbound and primary outbound trip with
an additional half trip associated with employees, deliveries, lunch-runs, etc. A factor of safety
was then also applied to assure an adequate and relevant number of pedestrians were
projected. A 50 percent factor of safety was used (versus the 10 percent factor used previously)
because these trips are recreational in nature (potential for wandering, etc). A summary of the
resulting trip totals are shown on Table 14 weekday. Again 16 percent of these trips were
assumed for the peak generator hour, as described previously.

As shown, the park is projected to generate a total of 42,360 pedestrian trips during the
weekday. There are 6,780 peak generator hour trips generated during the statistical average
attendance or 85th percentile frequency activity day of Riverfront Park.

4.2.1 Pedestrians - 85th Percentile Attendance
As indicated, traffic conditions were developed based off average attendance projections, which
is the 85th percentile attendance day of the Park. As this section is intended to guide in the
design of pedestrian facilities, it was also determined appropriate that some consideration also
be given to the 85th percentile attendance projections. As discussed in Section 1.2, 85th
percentile statistical attendance days are anticipated to occur 8 times per year with
approximately 25,000 attendees projected.

85th percentile pedestrian forecasts were developed in steps similar to those identified
previously. A summary of resulting trip totals is shown on Table 15 for the weekday and PM
peak hour. As shown, a total of 93,750 pedestrian trips would be generated during the 85th
percentile attendance day with 15,000 pedestrians generated during the peak generator hour.
This indicates each attendee would result in approximately 6.25 pedestrian trips throughout the
Park on a typical weekday.

4.2.2 15-Minute Projections
Tables 12 and 13 summarize average/85th percentile analysis day and 85th percentile statistical
attendance day projections for a peak generator hour. However, projections need to be
modified in order to be consistent with the 15-minute flow rates provided on Table 13. Peak
event activities will occur within a condensed timeframe as pedestrian approach or depart
special events. Thus, it is assumed that 70 percent of peak hour pedestrians will be condensed
within a 15-minute timeframe for event activities. A summary of resulting 15-minute pedestrian
demands for the average/85th percentile analysis day and 85th percentile statistical attendance
days are summarized on Table 16.

As shown, there is an average attendance, 15-minute pedestrian demand of 4,745 pedestrian
trips during the peak generator hour. This elevates to 10,500 pedestrian trips during the 85th
percentile attendance day.

4.3 PEDESTRIAN APPROACH & DEPARTURE ASSIGNMENTS
The approach and departure totals of pedestrians were approximated for Riverfront Park. The
totals provide the basis for estimating or confirming the width/capacity of major pedestrian
thoroughfares. The distribution and assignments of pedestrians was developed based on a
review of available parking within the area. The stall count noted in the field for separate areas
surrounding Riverfront Park was tallied and then compared, resulting in area distributions.
Figure 12 summarizes the assignment of pedestrian trips for the 15-minute demand timeframe
for the 85th percentile condition; providing a conservative analysis of pedestrian demands.

For the north bank, pedestrian distribution was segregated into three primary areas as based on
a review of available parking. The resulting distributions of approximately 42 percent, 29

percent, and 29 percent were established from this comparison for the areas north of the
Spokane River. Thus the respective 1,385 and 3,065 15-minute demands from Table were then
assigned based on these distributions. 85th percentile demands are again shown on Figure 12.

There are four primary distribution areas anticipated for the south bank, with distributions of 29
percent, 28 percent, 28 percent, and 15 percent calculated from parking areas/tallies south of
the Spokane River. The 15-minute 1,050 and 2,310 pedestrians demands for the south bank
were then compared with these distributions to generate the assignments shown in red.

Finally, pedestrians for central park area are anticipated from all parking lots surrounding
Riverfront Park (north and south of the Spokane River). The distributions calculated from these
parking lots include 22 percent, 21 percent, 21 percent, 12 percent, 10 percent, 7 percent, and 7
percent. The 15-minute 2,310 and 5,125 pedestrians demands generated by the central park
were compared with distributions, resulting in the assignments shown in green on Figure 12.

4.4 PRIMARY WALKWAY WIDTH RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of the 15-minute pedestrian demands shown on Figure 12 was to provide a basis
for recommending walkway approach/departure effective widths for the Park, as based on the
criteria summarized on Table 12. This comparison has led to the following recommendations.

Howard Street Bridge (South Park Entrance). As shown, it is anticipated that 1,415
pedestrians would use the Howard Street Bridge on an average attendance day. A comparison
with Table 12 suggests an effective walkway width of between 25 to 30 feet should be sufficient
to accommodate pedestrian traffic for the majority of the year to maintain a LOS C standard;
allowing for between 4 pedestrians to travel laterally with some level of comfort across the
bridge (pedestrian range depends on LOS standard desired). However, this is an effective
walkway width that would not accommodate additional activities outside of pedestrian activities.

A 15-minute demand of 3,135 pedestrians is anticipated on the 85th percentile attendance day,
which indicates a 50 to 55 foot wide bridge should be developed to maintain the LOS C
standard during these higher attendance conditions. This would provide space for vendor,
entertainment, and sightseeing activities, and allow for a dedicated bike lane during the majority
of the year. However, during 85th percentile statistical attendance or greater attendance
activities, vendor and bike activities can be restricted to provide for pedestrian activity only with
the recommended effective walkway width. This would allow for 8 to 9 persons to travel laterally
with some level of comfort across the bridge. Note the bridge has current width of 65 feet.

Howard Street Bridge (North Park Entrance). An 85th percentile attendance, 15-minute
demand of 1,100 pedestrians is noted along the Howards Street north bridge. This suggests a
minimum effective walkway width of 25 feet to maintain a LOS C standard. However, this
bridge provides many opportunities for sight-seeing, bike activities, entertainment, etc. As such,
a minimum width of 35 feet is recommended for the bridge. If vendor activities are anticipated,
then a greater minimum width should be maintained for the bridge. The northern section of this
bridge currently has a width of 55 feet, with a width of nearly 40 feet along the southern section.

Major Access Corridors. There are a number of major access corridors for Riverfront Park
that will accommodate a high number of entering and exiting pedestrians from the adjacent
street system, and will support high levels of pedestrian activity throughout the Park. Sidewalks

	                                                              Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                     Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

fronting Spokane Falls Boulevard, the corridors proposed around the south gateway and water
fountain, and routes proposed with vendor activity are examples of major access corridors.

These routes are anticipated to support up to 1,570 pedestrians in 15-minutes during the 85th
percentile attendance conditions, dictating a minimum effective walkway width of 30 feet to
maintain a LOS C standard. However, the corridors with vendor activity should be widened to a
minimum width of 45 feet to accommodate vendor stands and booths. In addition, special
attention should be given to the effective walkway impacts summarized on Table 13, as total
widths should be widened accordingly to accommodate objects such as light poles, trees,
wastebaskets, etc.; or widened accordingly to accommodate a 5 foot bike lane.

Minor Access Corridors. There are a number of minor access corridors connecting into and
extending through the Park. These corridors are anticipated to support less than 800
pedestrians in 15-minutes during the 85th percentile attendance conditions. This is an effective
walkway width of 15 feet technically; however, this is not entirely practical in many instances for
park access. As such, minor access corridors are recommended to have a 30 foot width unless
some form of right-of-way or obstruction is an issue. Again, the impact of objects and bike lanes
should be considered, per the width adjustments summarized via Table 13.

Narrow Suspension Bridge. There are two narrow suspension bridges aligned from the north
bank extended into central park with a total width of 10 feet. These bridges are anticipated to
support less than 500 pedestrians in 15-minutes during an 85th percentile attendance day. This
corresponds to an effective width recommendation of 10 feet to maintain a LOS C standard.
Thus, no modification to the bridge is necessary; however, no objects should be placed to
compromise the effective walking width of these bridges.

4.5 PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS
A Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities (AASHTO, 2004)
indicates “the majority of pedestrian trips are 0.25 miles or less”. Therefore ¼ mile was
considered the ideal spacing for pedestrian crossings that access Park frontage areas.

As summarized on Figure 6, crosswalks are aligned every 350 to 400 feet along Spokane Falls
Boulevard. The distance between the Post Street/Spokane Falls Boulevard and Lincoln
Street/Bridge Avenue intersection crossings is 1,000 feet. The distance between the Lincoln
Street/Bridge Avenue and Lincoln Street/Broadway Avenue intersection crossings is 700 feet.
The distance between the Lincoln Street/Broadway Avenue and Post Street/Mallon Avenue
intersection (along blocks) is only 700 feet. And, the spacing between crossings along Mallon
Avenue is 300 feet. All of these distances are well within the ¼ mile spacing target.

The longest crossing distances for Riverfront Park extends between the east Mallon Avenue
crossing and Washington Street/North River Drive intersection at 1,450 feet, and between
Washington Street/North River Drive and Spokane Falls Boulevard/Stevens Street intersections
at 1,850 feet. However, neither of these adjacent roadways front and therefore provide readily
available access to Riverfront Park. As such, the lack of pedestrian crossings is not an issue as
no real pedestrian access could be gained to/from the Park along this stretch of Washington
Street. It is therefore concluded that there is sufficient pedestrian crossings and access across
arterials fronting the Park, with no recommended improvements.

4.6 TRANSIT ACCOMMODATION
                                                                Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan

As discussed in Section 2.5, STA operates nine transit routes which can be easily access by
visitors of Riverfront Park. This calculates to about 150 buses circulating within an 1/8 mile walk
of the Park over 10 hours of typical Park visitation hours. These buses have a capacity of 60
seats per bus, which calculates to a person seating capacity of 9,000 over the ten hours.

As indicated by Section 3.1.1, up to 1,130 persons are forecast to use transit on the statistical
average attendance day up to 18 times a year. A meeting was held with STA officials as a part
of this project and it was confirmed that ridership demands of this level would not be sufficient to
warrant the increase or significant modification of current fixed routes, especially given the low
number of occurrences in a standard year. This is evidenced and supported by the comparison
provided in the previous paragraph. As such, STA will respond to larger events of Riverfront
Park on an event basis; providing additional transit or shuttle services, as needed.

With that said, STA officials did indicate a desire to improve transit access to/from Riverfront
Park. Specifically, they indicate a more central hub or center for the loading and unloading of
passengers would be of benefit to both STA and the Park. Three concepts were explored for
achieving more central access to the Park, which are summarized as follows:
     Howard Street Alignment. This concept would bring transit through the center of the
       Park along the historic Howard Street alignment that exists between Spokane Falls
       Boulevard and Mallon Avenue. Dedicated entirely to Park activities, there is a fountain,
       concessions, and two pedestrian bridges along the alignment. The improvements
       needed to relocate amenities, provide for a structurally sound roadway base, plus assure
       bridges could support weight the size of STA buses would ultimately be cost prohibitive.
       Plus, this would result in the less predictable interaction of buses and pedestrians within
       a core activity center of the Park. As such, this concept was dismissed as unviable.
     Frontage Enhancements. The two improvements identified in Section 3.3 provide an
       opportunity to for dedicated STA drop off areas to be constructed within primary north
       and south pedestrian approaches to/from the Park. Specifically, some form of bus lane
       or pull-out could be developed along Spokane Falls along the proposed boulevard area,
       and a transit pull-out or turnaround could be developed or promoted along the proposed
       North River Drive access. Although not central to the Park, these are reasonable and
       constructible options, even if short term, to better provide STA access over current
       curbside and in-street drop off areas.
     Washington/Stevens Transit Landing. STA officials have proposed a transit landing
       between Stevens Street and Washington Street north of Spokane Falls Boulevard. Both
       Stevens Street and Washington Street have three lanes extending between the Park
       underpass and Spokane Falls. The underutilized east southbound and west northbound
       lanes would be converted to transit lanes which would be operated contra-flow so buses
       could drop passengers at landings, which would be retro-fitted to the bridge. A stairway
       and/or pedestrian elevator would drop students to a landing constructed below, central
       to the park. Figure 13 highlights this concept, demonstrating that it is feasible, although
       likely to be costly. As such, this may be a better long-range improvement option for the
       Park and STA. Note although this is shown to be feasible from a concept geometric
       perspective, structural analyses and river environmental impact analysis would have to
       be performed to further advance the viability of the improvement as an option. However,
       it does seem STA officials have found an innovative way to enhance transit access.

                     5 PARKING CONDITIONS & ANALYSIS
This section outlines a summary parking analysis prepared for Riverfront Park. The intent of the
analysis is to confirm whether or not there is relevant parking adequacy to accommodate
demands for the average attendance and 85th percentile event day of the Park during the peak
generator hour. And while this study was based upon observed field data, further data should
be collected and analyzed in the event any outside party wanted to extrapolate this data to
confirm parking adequacies within the Spokane CBD overall.

Described in this section is discussion on parking generation followed by a comparison of these
demands with available parking within a ¼ mile vicinity of Riverfront Park.

5.1 PARKING GENERATION
Parking demands will vary throughout the attendance weekday of Riverfront Park with peak
demand expected during the generator hour. As discussed earlier within this study, it would be
an improbable task to accommodate traffic and by an extension parking for the maximum
attendance event. It is therefore a more reasonable expectation to plan parking facilities for the
average frequency condition of the Park, which is again the 85th percentile attendance day.

Parking generation was forecast from the peak automobile trip generation totals highlighted
from Tables 7 and 8, plus a 10 percent trip generation factor of safety. Note that taxi and shuttle
trips are neglected as they will frequent drop off zones and will not require parking.

As indicated previously, the peak generator hour will comprise 16 percent of weekday trips.
However, parking accumulation spans a longer timeframe than just the generator hour. For the
purpose of this study, a typical parking space was assumed to be occupied for two hours, on
average. That means Park demands comprise two hours of accumulation during a typical
weekday. The secondary hour of this study was assumed to comprise/include 14 percent of
weekday totals (whereas the first again comprises 16 percent). Thus, total parking demand
includes the combination of the peak and secondary generation hours, comprising 30 percent of
weekday totals.

These trips are directional, meaning they reflect both inbound and outbound trip totals. As such,
the forecasts must be factored/reduced to address directional distribution. As indicated
previously, a 55 percent inbound versus 45 percent outbound directional distribution was
assumed for the peak generator hour. However, this may vary somewhat with the secondary
hour. As such, 60 percent of totals were assumed to define raw parking generation for the Park.

Finally, before desired supply can be predicted, an additional 10 percent safety factor is applied
to raw demand. This factor of safety compensates for a number of issues, but principally
addresses lost time as patrons search for available parking. A summary of the resulting peak
generator timeframe parking demand is summarized on Table 17 for Riverfront Park, as
organized into the attendance/analysis zones.

As shown, parking generation of 1,685 vehicles would be associated with the statistical average
attendance or 85th percentile frequency activity day of Riverfront Park. This means this parking
capacity or adequacy/supply would be needed to address parking demands during the study
weekday by year 2020.

For purposes of comparison within the next section, this parking demand was estimated for
areas north and south of the Park and Spokane River. As indicated by Table 17, a demand of
475 parking stalls is anticipated by attendees of the north bank and 375 from the south bank.
Thus, these would utilize parking north and south of the Spokane River, respectively. Based on
the distribution comparisons/methodologies described for pedestrians (based on a comparison
of available parking), it is estimated that approximately 27 percent of parking demands for
central park would occur for areas north of the River (total of 225) versus 73 percent for parking
areas south of the River (total of 610). Thus, the total demands north and south of Spokane
River is as follows:
     North of Spokane River Parking Demands - 700 Parking Stalls
     South of Spokane River Parking Demands - 985 Parking Stalls

5.2 FIELD DEMANDS
These demand totals do NOT imply that officials with Riverfront Park must supply parking
facilities to address this need. To the contrary, there are approximately 7,335 parking stalls
projected within 73 parking lots and ramps located within a ¼ mile radius of the Park (including
700 parking stalls provided by Spokane Parks and Recreation Department officials). One
quarter mile is a typical and acceptable walking distance of most patrons of a recreational
facility such as a city park. This tally does not include adjacent street parking and the new
“Grand” hotel garage. Rather this reflects pay-lots only, which are predominantly surface street
parking lots and select garages, open daily to the public such as the Riverpark Square, the
Parkade, the Spokane Library, City Park, Fast Park, etc. A map of parking lot locations is
shown on Figure 13 in relation to Riverfront Park and the relative ¼ mile walking area. Parking
stall counts and totals are provided in Technical Appendix E.

Current parking demands were reviewed for the 73 parking facilities shown on Figure 13,
including counts at three different times on weekdays and two Saturdays. The focus for
weekdays was in the afternoon between 1 PM and 6 PM, as this is when parking demands peak
due to the workforce. The focus on Saturday was midday between 11 AM and 3 PM as this is
activities for a regional park typically peak (Saturday midday). A summary of count days and
times is as follows:
       Saturday May 16 - 1 PM to 3 PM
       Monday May 18 - 3 PM to 5 PM
       Tuesday May 19 - 4 PM to 6 PM
       Saturday May 23 - 11 AM to 1 PM
       Tuesday May 26 - 2 PM to 4 PM

To generate a conservative analysis, the peak count for each individual lot was identified and
used in demand tallies. A summary of parking demands and available capacity is summarized
on Table 18 for the weekday and Saturday, as distinguished for areas north and south of the
Spokane River. Also shown are Riverfront Park demands identified from the previous section.

As shown overall, there is a typical peak weekday demand of 3,625 stalls with 2,420 noted for
the peak Saturday timeframe, with 49 percent and 33 percent utilization noted for weekdays and
Saturdays, respectively. This leaves available adequacy/supply of 3,710 stalls on the weekday
and 4,915 on Saturday. As indicated, there is a peak generator hour demand of 1,685 vehicles
for Riverfront Park. Available supply well exceeds peak demands for Riverfront Park.

This conclusion can be derived overall, and for parking north and south of Spokane River.
Specifically, Riverfront Park facilities would not be sufficient to address average event or 85th
percentile event day parking demands. However, the availability of pay parking lots within ¼
mile of the Park would accommodate this overflow.                Thus, no additional parking is
recommended at this time.

                        6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
City of Spokane voters have supported the Spokane Parks Department by approving a $64.3
million bond to provide substantial capital improvements for Riverfront Park; projected for
completion within 3 to 5 years (by year 2020). These capital improvements are anticipated to
nearly double park attendance throughout the year. However, special event attendance will
almost triple due to the number and density of events. This TIA and design study was
developed to review future year 2020 traffic conditions assuming full development of Riverfront
Park. However, more specifically this study was developed to review peak generator hour traffic
impacts, pedestrian activity, and parking conditions assuming a special event condition
anticipated to occur with some frequency throughout the year.

The analysis condition turned out to be an “average” event attendee condition anticipated to
support up to 11,300 persons on a single day (or as a single day attendance of an event spread
out over a number of days). Even though this is an “average” in terms of the statistical
accounting of attendees (via an accounting/analysis of low versus maximum attendance
conditions), this event actually represents an 85th percentile condition in terms of frequency as
this level of attendance could occur up to 18 times out of 120 events anticipated throughout a
typical year. Stated another way, attendance would potentially exceed 11,300 only 18 times out
of 120 event days (thus an 85th percentile day). As any event day activities and attendance
would exceed that of a typical park day, it could therefore be concluded that this level of
attendance and traffic, pedestrian, and parking impacts would occur 18 times out of 365 days of
the year. Thus, this actually represents an approximate 95th percentile impact for Riverfront
Park for a typical year.

6.1 TIA/TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The scope for the traffic impact analysis (TIA) was established in coordination with staff from
City Transportation Department. Per direction, the study review traffic and transportation
impacts for nine intersections located along roadways fronting or providing access to Riverfront
Park, including Spokane Falls Boulevard, Washington Street, Stevens Street, Post
Street/Lincoln Street, Boone Avenue, Mallon Avenue, Cataldo Avenue, and North River Drive.
Traffic counts were collected during the weekday AM and PM peak/commute rush hours of
these intersections.

The ensuing operational/capacity analysis was performed based on PM peak hour traffic
volumes as they well exceed those identified for the AM peak hour. Also, the impacts of the
Park are anticipated to be most significant in the afternoon versus morning. As traffic volumes
during the weekday PM peak hour exceed those hourly volumes typically experienced during
weekends within the City central business district (CBD), the PM peak hour was also considered
the “design” hour for comparison with peak generation volumes anticipated following
improvements of Riverfront Park. Thus, this study is anticipated to be conservative as the peak
volumes of adjacent street traffic were compared with peak generator volumes anticipated on
the average attendance or 85th percentile event day for the Park.

Year 2020 traffic forecasts were developed from counts assuming a 10 percent baseline growth
rate (reflecting non-development growth) combined with trips generated by Riverfront Park. The
TIA concludes the Park is projected to generate a total of 1,423 peak generator hour trips during

	                                                              Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                     Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

the statistical average attendance and 85th percentile frequency activity day. Approximately 55
percent of these trips are anticipated to approach and 45 percent depart the Park during this
timeframe. Overall via City arterials, 29 percent of Park trips are anticipated to/from the north of
Mission Avenue; 16 percent to/from the south of Interstate 90; 22 percent to/from the west of the
Maple/Ash couplet, and 33 percent to/from the east of the Division/Ruby couplet.

The resulting traffic forecasts are considered conservative for two primary reasons. First, traffic
growth within the CBD has been minimal throughout the last 10 years. Thus, the application of
the 10 percent growth rate is high in context to negative traffic growth trends, but was assumed
given the redevelopment and revitalization that has occurred within the CBD over the last few
years. Second, counts already reflect some park activity as they were collected in the field on
typical weekdays when Riverfront Park was in operation. Thus, there is some “double” counting
of trips as the entire 1,423 peak generator trips were assigned to study intersections for the TIA.

Operations/Capacity Analysis. An operations analysis was developed based on geometric
and traffic control conditions noted in the field (i.e. number of lanes, turn lane location, speeds,
signals versus stop-signs, etc.); also using Synchro (traffic analysis files) provided by City staff
which reflect signal timing and phasing information currently used for these intersections. The
analysis concludes that there would be no unacceptable impacts within the TIA study area as
analyses measures-of-effectiveness (MOE’s) fall within acceptable tolerances prescribed by the
City. Moreover, the project trips appear to have only a minimal impact upon the operation of
City streets. As such, there are no improvements recommended as operations/capacity
mitigation as acceptable conditions were projected within the CBD.

With that said, two roadway improvements/modifications were examined as they were
highlighted by the Riverfront Park Master site plan, including:
    3) The reduction of a through lane on Spokane Falls Boulevard to allow for a landscape
        median and 45 degree parking between Washington Street and Post Street.
    4) The vacation of Cataldo Avenue for approximately 600 from Howard Street to just short
        of Washington Street reduce through traffic and promote site plan objectives.

An operations/capacity analysis concludes that these improvements/modifications would have
minimal impact upon traffic conditions, with MOE’s still within acceptable tolerances. In fact, the
vacation of Cataldo Avenue concept was expanded upon to incorporate a connection to the
signalized Washington Street/North River Drive intersection in order to address a safety issue
noted in the field for special event conditions of Riverfront Park and the Spokane Arena.

6.2 PEDESTRIAN/TRANSIT CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
An analysis of pedestrian conditions was performed principally to help with the design of primary
walkways that provide access to/from and through the Park. Pedestrian analyses was
performed based upon 15-minute peak demands projected for the 85th percentile attendance
day of the Park, which exceeds the average attendance day noted for traffic. The higher
standard was used because pedestrian comfort and mobility is crucial for a successful Park
venture. With that said, the pedestrian volumes predicted are only anticipated to occur with up
to 8 events each year; thus, the conclusions derived this review is conservative throughout the
majority of the year.




August	2015	                                                                               Page	47	
	                                                              Riverfront	Park	Master	Plan	
                                                     Traffic	Impact	Analysis	&	Design	Study	

The analysis concluded that 15-minute demand up to10,500 pedestrian trips during the 85th
percentile attendance day. 29 percent of these pedestrians are anticipate to frequent event
facilities along the north bank of the park, 49 percent within the center of the Park, and 22
percent along the south bank. These pedestrians were distributed to access principally parking
surrounding Riverfront Park, with the general walkway width conclusions as follows:
     Howard Bridge South should have a 50 to 55 foot effective and total width
     Howard Bridge north should have an effective minimum width of 35 feet
     Major access and travel corridors should have an effective width of 30 feet, with a total
       width of up to 45 feet where vendor activities are anticipated.
     Minor access and travel corridors should have an effective width of 15 feet with a total
       width of up to 20 feet where sightseeing or similar activities are anticipated.
     Suspension bridges are adequate at a width of 10 feet, assume no construction of
       additional obstructions.
The pedestrian analysis also concludes that there are sufficient, controlled crossings providing
access to Riverfront Park across adjacent City arterials.

There are no changes to transit warranted by this study. STA officials confirm they will respond
to any additional transit and shuttle needs on a case-by-case basis. There are improvement
options to enhance STA bus access to the Park that should receive some additional
consideration in the future. First, bus pullout lanes or turnaround should be considered on the
north and south entryways to the Park off Spokane Falls Boulevard and North River Drive,
respectively, as developed with the improvement recommendations highlighted in Sections 3.3
and 6.1. These should be reduced cost enhancements that can be implemented if and when
Park officials elect to construct recommended improvements.

Second STA officials have examined the potential for a transit drop-off and pickup area to be
situated between the northbound and southbound arterials of the Washington/Stevens Couplet.
This would convert underutilized traffic vehicle lanes into contra-flow transit lanes that could
drop pedestrians unto a “landing” constructed on the Spokane River bridge of the couplet, just
north of Spokane Falls Boulevard. An elevator and/or stairway would then extend to pedestrian
facilities below the bridge, providing access to the Park. This improvement does improve
centralized access to the Park, but would be costly and would require structural and
environmental studies to support feasibility. Thus, this is a long-term improvement option.
However, geometrically it does appear the improvement is feasible as shown in Figure 13
previously.

6.3 PARKING CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Parking demands were developed for Riverfront Park. A parking generation of 1,685 vehicles is
anticipated for the average attendance or 85th percentile frequency activity day of the Park with
700 parking stalls in demand north of Spokane River and 985 vehicles to the south.

Through field observation it was determined there are approximately 7,335 parking stalls
projected within 73 parking lots within a ¼ mile radius of Riverfront Park Park (including 700
parking stalls in designated Park lots). Through a review of parking lot utilization counts
performed for three weekdays and two Saturdays it was determined that parking is 49 percent
and 33 percent utilized for weekdays and Saturdays, respectively. There are 1,370 stalls
typically available north of Spokane River and 2,340 south during the typical weekday, with

1,765 available north and 3,150 south during a typical Saturday. The parking analysis
confirmed adequate parking supply was available to accommodate demands from Riverfront
Park during the average attendance and 85th percentile frequency day event. This indicates no
additional parking facilities are needed immediately based on the conclusions of this study.

6.4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This TIA and design study confirms that Riverfront Park can develop as proposed without
significantly impacting traffic, pedestrian, parking, and transit conditions as this study has
identified no transportation deficiencies.       As such, the improvements and strategies
recommended are not mitigating measures; rather they have been highlighted to further
advance mobility and safety within the Spokane CBD. City Parks and Transportation can work
to determine what, if any, of these recommendations can be implemented or if they should be
disregarded due to right-of-way issues, cost, etc.

This section of the Technical Appendix provides a glossary of terms. The Highway Capacity
Manual (TRB, 2010) and the Transportation Impact Analyses for Site Development (ITE, 2005)
were used to help with the development of the following definitions:
    Access point – An intersection, driveway, or opening on a roadway that provides
       access to a land use or facility.
    All-way stop-controlled – An intersection with stop signs located on all approaches.
    Arterial – (General Definition) A signalized street that primarily serves through-traffic
       and secondarily provides access to abutting properties.
    Average daily traffic (ADT) – The average 24 hour traffic volume at a given location on
       a roadway.
    Capacity – The number of vehicles or persons that can be accommodated on a
       roadway, roadway section, or at an intersection over a specified period of time. Capacity
       is also a term used to define limits for transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities. Concept
       typically expressed as vehicles per hour, vehicles per day, or persons per hour or per
       day.
    Collector street – (General Definition) A surface street providing land access and traffic
       circulation within residential, commercial, and industrial areas.
    Cycle – A complete sequence of cycle indicators.
    Cycle length – The total time for a signal to complete one cycle.
    Delay – The additional travel time experienced by a driver, passenger, or pedestrian.
    Demand – The number of users desiring service on a highway system or street over a
       specified time period. Concept typically expressed as vehicles per hour, vehicles per
       day, or persons per hour or per day.
    Departing sight distance – The length of road required for a vehicle to turn from a
       stopped position at an intersection (or driveway) and accelerate to travel speed.
    Downstream – The direction of traffic flow.
    Functional class – A transportation facility defined by the traffic service it provides.
    Growth factor – A percentage increase applied to current traffic demands or counts to
       estimate future demands/volumes.
    Level of Service – The standard used to evaluate traffic operating conditions of the
       transportation system. This is a qualitative assessment of the quantitative effect of
       factors such as speed, volume of traffic, geometric features, traffic interruptions, delays
       and freedom to maneuver. Operating conditions are categorized as LOS A through LOS
       “F”. LOS A generally represents the most favorable driving conditions and LOS F
       represents the least favorable conditions.
    Mainline – The primary through roadway as distinct from ramps, auxiliary lanes, and
       collector-distributor roads.
    Major Street – The street not controlled by stop signs at a two-way stop-controlled
       intersection.
    Minor arterial – (General Definition) A functional category of a street allowing trips of
       moderate length within a relatively small geographical area.
    Operational analysis – A use of capacity analysis to determine the level of service on
       an existing or projected facility, with known or projected traffic, roadway, and control
       conditions.
