Transportation Impact Analysis
620 Terry Avenue                                                                      September 2016



                                     Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential transportation-
related impacts to the surrounding street network associated with the development of the
proposed 620 Terry Avenue project in the First Hill neighborhood and Urban Center Village of
Seattle.


Project Description
The 620 Terry Avenue project is located on the block bounded by Terry Avenue on the
southwest, Boren Avenue on the northeast, Cherry Street to the northwest, and James Street
to the southeast in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle. The existing site is currently
occupied by two townhomes and approximately 4,600 sf of office space. The site vicinity
around the project study area is shown in Figure 1.

The proposed project would remove the existing uses and develop attached senior housing
with up to 245 units and approximately 2,300 square-feet of retail space. Vehicle parking will
be provided on-site and will include approximately 190 vehicle parking stalls and 57 long-term
bicycle storage spaces. Access to the parking garage will be provided via the alley
connecting to Cherry Street and James Street. A preliminary site plan for the development is
shown in Figure 2. The proposed project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by
2019 which was used as the horizon study year for this analysis.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis is based on coordination with City of Seattle Department of
Construction and Inspections (DCI) staff. Based on anticipated travel patterns for project-
generated vehicle traffic, the following intersections were selected for study:

    1.   Terry Avenue/Cherry Street
    2.   Terry Avenue/James Street
    3.   Alley/Cherry Street
    4.   Alley/James Street

Consistent with City requirements, this study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour. The
analysis includes a review of existing conditions in the vicinity of the project site, including the
street network, existing and future without-project peak hour traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2019) with-
project conditions are evaluated by adding site-generated traffic to future (2019) without-
project volumes and were then compared to future (2019) without-project conditions to
identify the relative impacts the proposed project has on the surrounding transportation
system.

     Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes both existing and future (2019) without-project conditions within the
identified study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street network, planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service.


Street Network
The following sections describe the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed
project and any anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.

Existing Inventory
The existing street characteristics in the proposed project vicinity are described below in
Table 1.

1.   Terry Avenue is a designated Green Street (SMC 23.415.516 Map A) between Jefferson Street and Spring Street.



Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2016-2021 Proposed Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), one City project in the area is anticipated to be completed before the project’s horizon
year: the Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).

The Madison Street BRT Study LPA Summary Report, December 2015 describes and
evaluates the preferred alternative for this project. The BRT will operate in Business Access
& Transit (BAT) lanes or exclusive transit lanes allowing for turn lanes, curb cuts and parking
from 1st Avenue to 6th Avenue and 15th Avenue to 18th Avenue along Madison Street.


Vehicle Traffic Volumes
The following sections document the development of the traffic volumes used in the existing
and future without-project operations analyses.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes are based on weekday PM peak period (4:00 to 6:00 PM) traffic
counts conducted at each of the project’s study intersections in July 2016. Existing PM peak
period traffic count worksheets are shown in Appendix A and existing traffic volumes are
rounded to the nearest five vehicles to account for daily fluctuations and are shown in Figure
3.

Future Without-Project Volumes
Future (2019) without-project traffic volumes are comprised of the existing traffic volumes,
background traffic growth, and traffic generated from the planned “pipeline” developments.
An annual growth rate of 1.5 percent was applied to existing study intersection traffic volumes
to estimate 2019 horizon year background traffic growth. In addition to the growth rate, which
accounts for the background growth from pipeline project in the area, traffic from specific
pipeline projects in the vicinity were added to the future (2019) without-project traffic volumes
as a conservative estimate and to account for cumulative impacts. The pipeline project
included in the background growth are listed below. Forecast future without-project traffic
volumes for the future horizon year are shown in Figure 4.

Pipeline projects are based on a review of planned developments on the Seattle Department
of Construction & Inspections website and through coordination with City staff, eight planned
development projects were identified in the study area. These “pipeline projects” account for
the cumulative impacts without the project and have been approved or are in the approval
process but have yet to be constructed. These projects include:

        1050 James Street: Construction of a 74-unit residential building.

        800 Columbia Street: Construction of a 287-unit residential building.

        707 Terry Avenue: Development of a 450 residential apartment building with
         approximately 7,500 square feet of retail space.

        1001 James Street: Development of a 340-unit apartment building with approximately
         5,380 square feet of retail.

        Swedish First Hill: Projects trips for future (2020) conditions from the Swedish Medical
         Center First Hill Campus Block 95 Tower and Northwest Tower, January 2016.

        500 Terry Avenue: This project would develop 328 multifamily residential units.

        515 Minor Avenue: Construction of approximately 133,000 square feet of medical office
         building.

        326 9th Avenue: Addition to Harborview Hospital.

Vehicular Traffic Operations
The following sections summarize traffic operations for existing and future conditions for
individual study intersections.

Intersection Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). At signalized intersections, LOS is measured in average
control delay per vehicle and is typically reported using the intersection delay and volume-to-
capacity ratio (V/C). At unsignalized side-street, stop-controlled intersections, LOS is
measured by the average delay on the worst-movement of the intersection. Traffic operations
and average vehicle delay for an intersection can be described qualitatively with a range of
levels of service (LOS A through LOS F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F
indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (2010), and were evaluated using Synchro 9. Synchro 9 is a software
program that uses HCM methodology to evaluate intersection LOS and average vehicle
delays. Results for the existing and future without-project operations analyses are
summarized in Table 2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis are included
in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, during the existing weekday PM peak hour, all intersections currently
operate at LOS C or better. When future pipeline project volumes and background growth are
added to the existing traffic volumes, the study intersections continue to operate at the same
LOS with minimal increases in delay under existing conditions during the weekday PM peak
hour in 2019, with the exception of one intersection. The Terry Avenue/Cherry Street
intersection is anticipated to degrade form LOS B to LOS C with less than approximately a 1
second increase in delay under future (2019) without-project conditions.


Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from the Seattle Department of
Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. A
summary of the total and average annual number of reported accidents at each study
intersection and along the roadway segments adjacent to the proposed project is provided

As shown in Table 3, all study intersections and corridors experienced less than an average
of 5 collisions per year. No fatality or bicycle collisions were report and 1 pedestrian collision
was reported. The pedestrian collision was reported at the Terry Avenue/James Street
intersection and occurred under dry conditions at dusk.

The SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The most
recent review was completed in 2016 and screens locations for the previous year (in this
case 2015). As defined by SDOT’s annual High Collision Location Review, locations are
identified as a HCL at signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a year,
unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, mid-block locations with 10 or more
collisions a year, and locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions.

SDOT has not identified any of the study intersections as HCLs.


Transit
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro. The proposed project is
very well-served by transit. Within the study area Jefferson Street is considered a major
transit street and Boren Avenue is classified as a minor transit street. The nearest bus lines
to the proposed project are located along Boren Avenue between Columbia Street and
Cherry Street approximately 0.1 miles away or a 2 to 3-minute walk. Additional Stops are
located along 9th Avenue. Local transit routes serving stops within one-quarter mile of the
project site are summarized in Table 4.

headways are approximately 10 minutes during peak hours.


Non-Motorized Facilities
The following sections describe existing and future planned pedestrian and bicycle conditions
within the project vicinity.

Pedestrians
Pedestrian facilities consist primarily of sidewalks along both sides of the streets within the
study area. Each of the study intersections include sidewalk curb ramps, and a marked
crosswalk on the south leg of the Terry Avenue/James Street intersection. Based on a review
of the City of Seattle 2015-2020 Adopted CIP and Pedestrian Master Plan, neighborhood
greenway improvements are planned along Terry Avenue in 2017 within the immediate
vicinity of the proposed project site.

Bicycles
On 9th Avenue, from Spruce Street to Jefferson Street, there is an in-street bike lane on the
east side and sharrows on the west side. North of Jefferson Street, 9th Avenue has sharrows
on both sides of the street. Broadway contains a two-way cycle track from E Yesler Way to E
Howell Street.

Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015-2020 Adopted CIP, and 2015-2019 Seattle
Bicycle Master Plan – Implementation Plan, neighborhood greenway improvements are
planned along Terry Avenue in 2017 within the immediate vicinity of the proposed project
site. However, specific design details are not yet available.

                                 Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street network and study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated by the
proposed site are distributed and assigned to adjacent streets and intersections within the
study area for the weekday PM peak hour study period. Next, project trips are added to future
without-project traffic volumes and any potential impact to traffic operations, safety, non-
motorized facilities, and transit are identified. Site specific items are also discussed such as
the operation of the site’s access driveway and estimated on-site parking demand of the
proposed project’s land uses.


Vehicle Trip Generation
Project trip generation was estimated based on a widely accepted urban development
practice of calculating person trips and then estimating the portion of the person trips that
would be vehicle, bicycle, walking, or transit trips. Most Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and may over predict the number of
vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit. Therefore, the trip generation in this
analysis considers the use of alternative modes. The number of overall vehicle trips
generated was determined by calculating total person trips in the weekday daily, AM, and PM
peak hour conditions and then separating the person trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto,
transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates the trip generation process.

from ITE’s Trip Generation (9th Edition) and NCHRP 365. Person trips using each
transportation mode were determined by multiplying the total person trips by the estimated
mode splits from 2010 – 2014 American Community Survey’s Selected Economic

Characteristics data for the project’s location (Census Tract #85). The First Hill neighborhood
is well-served by transit, has low vehicle ownership rates, and is close to many employment
centers in the First Hill and Downtown Seattle neighborhoods which allows residents take
many walking and biking trips.

Table 5 provides a summary of the trip generation for the proposed land uses. A detailed
summary of the trip generation calculations for these uses has been provided in Appendix D.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in Table 5, the development is anticipated to generate approximately 192 new
vehicle trips daily with approximately 9 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 13
new vehicle trips during the typical weekday PM peak hour.


Vehicle Trip Distribution & Assignment
Trip distribution patterns to and from the project site were based on existing vehicle travel
patterns, previous studies in the project vicinity, and U.S. Census Bureau’s OnTheMap tool.
OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more
likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive. As the majority of local project trips
around First Hill are anticipated to use transit or non-motorized methods to and from the site,
vehicle trips are anticipated to be longer in duration and likely directed to and from the
freeways in the area. The project trip distribution for vehicle trips is shown in Figure 5.

The anticipated weekday PM peak hour net new vehicle trip generation was assigned to the
street network and the study intersections based on the distribution patterns described above
and shown in Figure 5. At the site access, the new trip generation was assigned to the
access garage as this is a new driveway that will accommodate all project traffic.

Cumulative Vehicle Traffic Volume Impact
The assigned project generated traffic was added to the future without-project weekday PM
peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections. The addition of project trips with future
without project traffic that included background growth and pipeline project traffic provides for
an analysis of cumulative impacts. The resulting 2019 with-project traffic volumes are shown
in Figure 6. Table 6 summarizes the percent increase of traffic volumes at the study
intersections that are attributable to the anticipated trip generation of the proposed project
during the weekday PM peak hour.

As shown in Table 6, the proposed project is anticipated to account for less than 5 percent of
the total weekday PM peak hour traffic at the off-site study intersections. The project share at
the site access with Cheery Street is anticipated to be approximately 8 percent, and less than
1 percent with the site access with James Street. Traffic volumes typically fluctuate day-to-
day by 5 to 10 percent depending on factors such as the day of the week, weather conditions,
and traffic conditions elsewhere in the surrounding street network. This increase in traffic
volumes related to project traffic falls within these normal fluctuations and will likely go
unnoticed by the majority of roadway users in the study area.


Cumulative Vehicle Traffic Operations Impact
The following sections summarizes cumulative traffic operations impact for future without and
with-project conditions for individual intersections.

Intersection Operations
A future with-project level-of-service analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour
to analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methodologies were applied and
all intersection parameters such as channelization and intersection control were consistent
with those used in the evaluation of future without-project conditions. A comparison of horizon
year 2019 future without-project and future with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic
operations are summarized in Table 7 (page 16). Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in
Appendix C.

With the addition of project generated traffic during the weekday PM peak hour study period,
all study intersections would continue to operate at the same LOS as without-project
conditions with only minor increases in delay occurring. All study intersections are anticipated
to continue to operate at LOS C or better during future with-project conditions.


Site Access
The proposed project includes an underground parking garage designated for the residential,
and retail uses. Access to the garage would be provided via the alley connecting to Cherry
Street and James Street. The alley intersections on at Cherry Street and James Street are
anticipated to operate at LOS B or better during the weekday PM peak hour.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Two screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that were
analyzed for concurrency review include the Ship Canal between University and Montlake
Bridges (Screenline 5.16), and East of the CBD (Screenline 12.12), as shown in Table 8. As
a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the
direction from the proposed project in the direction of the screenlines would extend across
the screenlines included in this analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenlines would have volume-to-capacity ratios that are less than the City’s volume-to-
capacity threshold; thus, the proposed project would meet concurrency requirements.

Transit Impacts
The transit stops and routes located near the project site provide connections to existing
transit services for residents and visitors to the project site. Additionally, the First Hill streetcar
is operational in the area providing transit service along Broadway throughout First Hill
traveling north to Capitol Hill and south to the Central District and the International District.
The nearest stop for the First Hill Streetcar is located on Broadway at Terrace Avenue which
is approximately 0.3 miles (or a 5 to 6-minute walk) from the project site. The streetcar will
increase the transit access, frequency, and reliability for tenants and patrons of the proposed
development to Capitol Hill, Downtown area, and Link light rail. Along with the existing
extensive bus network, the site will continue to be well connected to the region by transit.


Non-Motorized Impacts
Pedestrians and bicyclists are anticipated to account for a share of the trips generated by the
proposed project as the project is well served by both pedestrian and bicycle facilities. To
accommodate bicyclists, secure bicycle storage for at least 57 bikes will be provided on site.
The two-way cycle track that currently existing along Broadway provides a north-south
connection in East Seattle and connects to other local and regional bicycle routes.


Parking Analysis
A parking analysis for the proposed development was completed. The following sections
describe the proposed parking supply and the estimated peak parking demand of the project.

Parking Supply
The proposed project will provide a below-grade, on-site parking garage that will be used by
building tenants and retail patrons. The project is proposing to provide 190 parking stalls.

As previously mentioned, the parking garage for the proposed project will be accessed from
the alley between Cherry Street and James Street. In addition, the proposed project will also
provide a minimum of 57 long-term bicycle parking spaces.

Parking Demand
Attached Senior Housing. Parking demand for the project was estimated based on ITE
Parking Generation (4th Edition) for Attached Senior housing (LU 252). Parking Generation
data indicate that during the weekday peak period (9 a.m. to 3 p.m.), the average peak
parking demand rate is listed as 0.59 vehicles per dwelling unit.

Based on this, the anticipated parking demand is shown in Table 9.

                              Units


As shown in Table 9, using the parking rate per dwelling unit, the resulting peak parking
demand would be 145 vehicles.

Retail. The retail parking demand was calculated based on Parking Generation (ITE, 4th
Edition). A rate of 2.55 spaces per 1,000 square feet, which is reduced by the mode split of



                                                                                               Page 17

vehicles representing only 15 percent of anticipated retail travel, gives a rate of 0.38 spaces
per 1,000 square feet of retail. Using these rates, the anticipated peak parking demand is
estimated to be 1 vehicle for the retail land use. Retail demands typically peak during midday
conditions and could be accommodated in the on-site parking garage.

Parking Code Requirements
Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015 Table A and Table B, there are no minimum
parking requirements for residential uses located in urban centers. This project is located
within the First Hill Urban Center Village and thus, no minimum parking requirements apply to
the proposed development.

Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking is an important end of trip facility that is
important in promoting the use of bicycle travel to and from a site. Beyond the environmental
and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists reduce the traffic and parking
impacts of a development and support many City and Neighborhood comprehensive plan
goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is also important to keep sidewalks fully
ADA compliant and passable, and reduces the chances of bicycles obstructing emergency
escape routes.

Per SMC 23.54.015, bicycle parking is required to be provided by new developments. The
SMC requires secure, covered long-term bicycle parking for residential developments. Due to
the project’s Urban Center location and the anticipation that it will have fewer vehicle and
more non-motorized trips, the bicycle storage rate is higher. The bicycle parking requirements
for the site are shown in Table 10.

As shown in Table 10, the proposed development is required to provide 57 long-term bicycle
parking spaces and no short-term bicycle parking space. The current development plan will
provide a minimum of 62 long-term bicycle parking spaces and would meet code
requirements.

                         Findings and Conclusions
This transportation impact analysis summarizes the project traffic impacts of the proposed
620 Terry Avenue senior housing development project in the First Hill neighborhood of
Seattle. General findings and recommendations include:
          The proposed project would develop up to 245 senior housing residential units and
           approximately 2,300 square feet of retail use. This development would replace the
           existing uses occupying the project site.
          The development would generate vehicular, walking, bicycling and transit trips. The
           development is anticipated to generate approximately 192 new vehicle trips daily
           with approximately 9 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 13 vehicle
           trips during the typical weekday PM peak hour.
          Project traffic would represent less than 5 percent of the 2019 weekday PM peak
           hour traffic volumes at the off-site study intersections.
          All off-site intersections currently operate at LOS B or better and are anticipated to
           operate at LOS C or better under future without or with-project conditions.
          Access to the proposed project would be provided via the alley off Cherry Street
           and James Street. The alley intersections on Cherry Street and James Street are
           anticipated to operate at LOS B or better.
          The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the
           project, the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City level of
           service thresholds; thus, the conditions would meet concurrency requirements.
          The proposed site is located next to frequent and reliable transit as well as near
           extensive pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The site is anticipated to have an
           approximate peak vehicle parking demand of 145 vehicles for the residential, and 1
           vehicle for the retail use, totaling 146 vehicles if the uses were to peak at the same
           time. The garage will provide 190 parking stalls which will meet the vehicle parking
           demand. The project will provide 57 long-term bicycle parking spaces and would
           meet code requirements.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
