EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of the transportation impact study (TIS) for the proposed mixed-use
development known as the Watson Ranch Specific Plan located in the City of American Canyon, California.
The Project site is located east of the railroad tracks primarily between the extensions of Watson Lane and
the South Napa Junction Road. The proposed Project will contain a 200-room hotel, a 600-student
elementary school, 1,253 residential dwelling units, 21,188 square feet of retail space, 11,790 square feet of
restaurant space, 8,935 square feet of winery/brewery space, a 20,000 square-foot community center, 71,210
square feet of event space (both indoor and outdoor), a 12,466 square foot amphitheater, and more than
three acres of outdoor space. There is also a 31,085 square-foot area for a farmers’ market, a 12,822 square-
foot area for a food truck court, and a community plaza. There are also two opportunity sites that could
add 14,780 square feet of retail and 14,780 square feet of office to the totals above.

The Project would also construct a third lane in each direction on SR-29 between Rio Del Mar and Eucalyptus
Drive, which will serve as through-right turn lanes. Signal modifications would occur at both intersections.

The impacts of the Project were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of American Canyon, the City
of Vallejo, Napa County, and Caltrans. Roadway system operations were evaluated under the following
study scenarios:

       Existing Conditions
       Existing Plus Project Conditions
       Existing Plus Background Conditions
       Existing Plus Background Plus Project Conditions
       Cumulative No Project Conditions
       Cumulative Plus Project Conditions

Pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities were also evaluated.



PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES

Project-generated vehicle trips were estimated using the MXD trip generation model, which uses rates and
equations published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) and applies trip reduction
percentages to account for the internal trips inherent to mixed-use developments. Trip reduction
percentages were based on Project information such as land use mix, Project area, intersection density, and
transit stop placement, as well as local and regional demographic data such as average household size,


                                                                                                               i

employment within one mile of the site, and employment within a 30 minute transit trip. The proposed
Project is estimated to generate 15,527 net daily vehicle trips, with 952 net trips occurring during the AM
peak hour (316 in and 636 out), and 1,305 occurring during the PM peak hour (799 in and 506 out).



PROJECT IMPACTS

This analysis identifies potentially significant adverse impacts of the proposed Project on the surrounding
transportation system and recommends measures to mitigate significant impacts for environmental
clearance.

       (#24) Fairgrounds Drive / SR-37 Westbound Ramps (AM and PM peak hours)
       (#25) Fairgrounds Drive / SR-37 Eastbound Ramps (PM peak hour)

The results of the simulations show that SR-29 (as a four-lane facility) serves far less than the total demand,
with or without the Project. As a result of the limited capacity, the same amount of northbound and
southbound through traffic vehicles is served with or without the project. The Project adds only northbound
and southbound through traffic at most of these intersections. Delay does not consistently increase in the
VISSIM models, because the additional vehicles cannot get to the intersections. With a congested corridor



                                                                                                             iii

that is over-capacity, and without the ability to serve any Project traffic, the addition of Project traffic simply
adds to the No Project queues. As a result, vehicle traffic impacts at these intersections are all considered
to be significant.


PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS

Pedestrian Facilities

Though the project is not anticipated to attract much pedestrian traffic from outside the Project, the site
should be designed to provide this access. Rio Del Mar, Newell Drive, and Rolling Hills Drive, as well as the
trail connections at the boundaries of the Project site, provide direct and safe access for pedestrians off-
site. The generation of pedestrian traffic from outside of the Project site should not impact vehicle
operations or pedestrians. No other off-site improvements are proposed.

All major internal streets have sidewalks buffered by landscaping. Several internal trails will connect to
existing and planned trails at the boundaries of the Project. Crosswalks should be clearly marked across
roadway connections along Rio Del Mar and Newell Drive. Any impacts to the on-site pedestrian facilities
are projected to be less than significant, though a detailed evaluation of the mixed-use area should be
conducted when those plans are available.

Bicycle Facilities

The existing and planned bicycle facilities can accommodate the increased bicycle demand; therefore, the
impact to bicycle facilities is less-than-significant and no mitigation measures are needed. The City does
not have a requirement for bicycle parking, but Class I and Class II bicycle parking should be provided to
serve the retail, restaurant, and hotel uses, as well as the event space and amphitheater. Any impacts to the
bicycle facilities are projected to be less than significant.

Transit Facilities

The proposed Project will generate additional demand for the existing transit services in the area, which can
be accommodated by the existing transit capacity. The City can further support transit usage by modifying
the ACT route to directly access the Project site. Therefore, impacts to transit service are expected to be
less than significant.


SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Vehicle access would be provided via Newell Drive, Rio Del Mar, and Rolling Hills Drive. The Watson Ranch
Specific Plan presents a circulation system that encompasses a network designed for an array of
transportation modes. The circulation system promotes “complete streets” principles, creating a complete

                                                                                                                 iv
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study

system of roadways that make sense in the context of the land uses they serve while accommodating all
modes. A hierarchy of streets, walkways, and trails throughout the development area provides a layered
network that will allow vehicles to flow smoothly and safely within the community, while also creating a rich
and vital pedestrian environment.

The grid network proposed is appropriately layered to provide access to, from, and within the Project site.
A complete set of plans, including detailed street sections for all internal roadways, should be reviewed
before final submittal. In areas with five-foot bike lanes next to an eight-foot parking area, a rearrangement
of the dimensions or the locations should be considered. Vehicles could adequately utilize a seven-foot
parking area, allowing the bicycle lanes to be six feet wide and provide an enhanced experience for cyclists.
Additionally, parking could be provided next to the vehicle travel lanes, with the bicycle lanes provided next
to the curb. This should be carefully considered in the context of any drainage inlets located along the
curbs, and a buffer would likely need to be provided. Some portion of the landscaped space separating the
sidewalk from the current parking area could also be reapportioned for the bicycle facilities.

In areas with ten-foot wide lanes or 20-foot wide travel areas, detailed studies should be done (once plans
are developed to ensure that service vehicles can make all the necessary turns. These include garbage and
recycling trucks, as well as larger delivery (e.g. UPS) trucks. A detailed assessment of the circulation plan for
the mixed-use (non-residential) area should be conducted once detailed plans are developed. A detailed
evaluation of the school circulation plan, including pick-up and drop-off periods should be conducted once
a site plan is developed. The circulation plan should remain in compliance with the Watson Ranch Specific
Plan.


PARKING AND LOADING IMPACTS

Parking near intersections should also be restricted within 25 feet of intersections in the residential areas to
allow for additional sight distance. In the low- and medium-density residential areas, the combination of
garage and on-street parking to be provided will be sufficient for the tenants and their guests. The hotel,
restaurant, community center, and retail should provide at least 785 vehicle parking spaces, which assumes
no shared parking. The current Specific Plan proposed 1,023 parking spaces for the non-residential, non-
school uses. The City of American Canyon’s requirement for the number of accessible spaces is regulated
by the State of California Building Standards Code, Title 24, Chapter 11B, Division 2.

1.      INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed mixed-use
development known as the Watson Ranch Specific Plan located in the City of American Canyon, California.
The Project site is located east of the railroad tracks primarily between the extensions of Watson Lane and
the South Napa Junction Road. There are no existing uses at the Project site that need to be accounted for
with the addition of the Project. With an emphasis on complete streets in the Project site design and the
mix of land uses, the travel demand estimates account for the internalization of some vehicle trips within
the site, as well as the potential for the use of modes such as walking, biking, and riding transit. This chapter
discusses the TIA purpose, Project study area, analysis scenarios and methods, criteria used to identify
significant impacts, and report organization.



PURPOSE AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This analysis was conducted to identify potentially significant adverse impacts of the proposed Project on
the surrounding transportation system and to recommend measures to mitigate significant impacts for
environmental clearance.

The proposed Project will contain a 200-room hotel, a 600-student elementary school, 1,253 residential
dwelling units, 21,188 square feet of retail space, 11,790 square feet of restaurant space, 8,935 square feet
of winery/brewery space, a 20,000 square-foot community center, 71,210 square feet of event space (both
indoor and outdoor), a 12,466 square foot amphitheater, and more than three acres of outdoor space.
There is also a 31,085 square-foot area for a farmers’ market, a 12,822 square-foot area for a food truck
court, and a community plaza.

Additionally, two opportunity sites could be included the future, which would include a live/work building
and/or a mixed-use building with ground floor retail and residential uses above it. Should the live/work
building be built, those units would reduce the 1,253 residential dwelling units elsewhere throughout the
site to maintain the same number of dwelling units. Live/work units tend to generate fewer trips than more
traditional residential units during the peak periods; as a result, this building is not analyzed specifically but
would be anticipated to decrease the trip generation should it be built.

The mixed use building would have ground floor retail with a story of office above it. The building is
anticipated to include two 14,780 square foot stories; as a result, an additional 14,780 square foot of retail
and 14,780 square feet of office is analyzed as part of the Project.



                                                                                                                1

Although several circulation alternatives have been considered, one is presented within this study. Rio Del
Mar will be the access point from SR-29, and will function as a two-lane road with additional turn lanes at
the SR-29 intersection. Rio Del Mar will pass under the railroad tracks on the east side of SR-29. The
intersection at Rio Del Mar and SR-29 will continue to be signalized and will add new phases to support
entering and exiting the Project. Rio Del Mar will continue to the east and terminate at Newell Drive, which
will be extended from its current terminus at Donaldson Way north to the limits of the Project area. Newell
Drive will function as a four-lane arterial between its current terminus and the Rio Del Mar extension; from
the Rio Del Mar extension north to the new terminus, Newell Drive will be a two-lane arterial. This road will
serve Project traffic only. Additionally, a minor connection will be provided to the Project from Rolling Hills
Drive; these connections will function to serve traffic locally on the east side of SR-29 and will be designed
to discourage cut-through traffic. The Project would also construct a third lane in each direction on SR-29
between Rio Del Mar and Eucalyptus Drive, which will serve as through-right turn lanes.

Figure 1 shows the location of the Project site, the surrounding transportation network, and study
intersections. Figure 2 shows the roadway network alternative as described above.

This study addresses the Project’s impacts on the roadway system and the adjacent bicycle, pedestrian, and
transit network. Project impacts were evaluated following the guidelines of the Cities of American Canyon
and Vallejo, the Napa Valley Transportation Authority (NVTA, formerly NCTPA), the congestion
management agency for Napa County, and Caltrans.

     PROJECT STUDY AREA

     STUDY INTERSECTIONS

     Project impacts on the study area roadway facilities were determined by measuring the effect Project traffic
     would have on intersection operations during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM)
     peak periods, when traffic volumes on the surrounding roadways are highest. A total of 26 intersections
     were selected in consultation with City staff as study locations. These locations were chosen based on the
     City of American Canyon Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Guidelines (September 2007), which indicate that Project
     access intersections and intersections adjacent to the site should be analyzed along with signalized
     intersections where the proposed Project adds 50 or more peak hour vehicles. These intersections represent
     the locations most likely to experience traffic impacts associated with the Project. The study intersections
     and their jurisdictions are (intersections with an asterisk indicate that they are within the jurisdiction of the
     City of American Canyon; bolded intersections indicated that they are within the jurisdiction of Caltrans):

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS

The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the weekday morning (AM) and weekday
evening (PM) peak hours for the following six scenarios:

        Scenario 1:       Existing Conditions - Existing volumes obtained from counts collected in May and
                          June 2014.

        Scenario 2:       Existing Plus Project Conditions - Scenario 1 volumes plus traffic generated by the
                          proposed Project.

        Scenario 3:       Existing Plus Background Conditions - Existing volumes plus traffic from approved
                          but not yet constructed developments in the area.

        Scenario 4:       Existing Plus Background Plus Project Conditions - Scenario 3 volumes plus traffic
                          generated by the proposed Project.

        Scenario 5:       Cumulative Conditions – Existing volumes from Scenario 1 plus growth from
                          reasonable buildout land use projections for the year 2035 from the Napa-Solano
                          County Travel Demand Forecasting Model (N-STDM).

        Scenario 6:       Cumulative Plus Project Conditions - Scenario 5 volumes plus traffic generated by
                          the proposed Project.



TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODS

Operational traffic analyses focus on intersections rather than roadway segments, due to the capacity
constraints typically occurring at the intersections. The operational performance of a roadway network is
commonly described with the term level of service or LOS. LOS is a qualitative description of operating
conditions, ranging from LOS A (free flow traffic conditions with little or no delay) to LOS F (oversaturated
conditions where traffic flows exceed design capacity, resulting in long queues and delays). The LOS analysis
methods outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2000) were used in this
study. The HCM methods for calculating LOS for signalized intersections and unsignalized intersections are
described below.




                                                                                                           6

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

Traffic operations at signalized intersections were evaluated using the LOS method described in Chapter 16
of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. While the Synchro software package was used to model traffic
conditions throughout most of the project study area, the VISSIM software package was used to model
traffic conditions along SR-29 between Napa Junction Road (#6) and American Canyon Road (#11). Due to
the existing congestion on this corridor, VISSIM was selected for this analysis because it models the effects
of closely spaced intersections and queue spillback from one intersection to another.

Synchro is a macrosimulation tool that uses deterministic equations to evaluate operations at an
intersection.   VISSIM is a stochastic microsimulation software that analyzes the traffic operations by
simulating the movement of individual cars, trucks, transit vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles. Different
random seed numbers (which randomly determine when vehicles will enter the network, within the
parameters of the inputs) generate different driver behaviors and system results. The model is run multiple
times to account for the randomness of the simulations and to ensure that the results are reasonable.
VISSIM allows the user to control vehicle inputs, vehicle routes, vehicle fleet composition, desired speeds
throughout the network, conflict areas to determine yielding behavior, driver behavior, parking areas and
behavior, and pedestrian and bicycle volumes and behavior. VISSIM also reflects that conditions at one
location can affect conditions at another (i.e. queue spillback from one signalized intersection to another,
or “starvation” at a signalized intersection because of poor operations at an upstream location).

A signalized intersection’s LOS is based on the weighted average control delay measured in seconds per
vehicle. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time (if multiple cycles are needed
to clear the intersection), stopped delay, and final acceleration. Table 1 summarizes the relationship
between the control delay and LOS for signalized intersections.

           noticeable.

           high V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences. This is considered to
           be the limit of acceptable delay.

           poor progression, or very long cycle lengths.

  UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

  In Chapter 17 of the Transportation Research Board’s 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, the LOS for
  unsignalized intersections (side-street or all-way stop controlled intersections) is also defined by the
  average control delay per vehicle (measured in seconds). The control delay incorporates delay associated
  with deceleration, acceleration, stopping, and moving up in the queue. For side-street stop-controlled
  intersections, delay is calculated for each stop-controlled movement and for the uncontrolled left turns, if
  any, from the main street. The delay and LOS for the intersection as a whole and for the worst movement
  are reported for side-street stop intersections. The intersection average delay is reported for all-way stop
  intersections. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.
  The delay ranges for unsignalized intersections are lower than for signalized intersections as drivers expect
  less delay at unsignalized intersections.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is the state agency responsible for rail safety. The agency’s
jurisdiction includes railroad interlocking plants and public highway grade crossings. CPUC approval is
required to modify a railroad interlocking plant (including construction of a new spur track) or modification
to an existing public railroad grade crossing. Completion and submittal of a General Order 33-B is required
for any proposed work to a railroad interlocking plant (e.g., spur track) and a General Order 88-B is required
for any proposed work to a public highway grade crossing.


METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION

The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) serves as the transportation planning, coordinating,
and financing agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. The MTC created and maintains the
Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS), a multimodal system of highways, major arterials, transit
services, rail lines, seaports, airports, and transfer hubs that are critical to regional transportation between
the nine Bay Area counties. MTS facilities within the study area include I-80, SR-12, SR-29, SR-37, SR-121,
SR-221, Airport Boulevard, and American Canyon Road. The MTS is incorporated into MTC’s 2001 Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP), and is used as a guideline in prioritizing for planning and funding of facilities in
the Bay Area. Facilities included in the MTS provide access to major Bay Area activity centers, supply
convenient and efficient connections, and/or provide alternative routes or modes for congested areas or
regions with limited facilities.

                                                                                                              9

June 2016




AMERICAN CANYON GENERAL PLAN

The City of American Canyon General Plan sets forth guiding and implementing policies relevant to
transportation. Below are the key guiding and implementing policies that relate to the Watson Ranch
Specific Plan:

Guiding Policy 1.6: Achieve and maintain a Multimodal LOS D or better for roadways and intersections
during peak hours where possible and as long as possible. However, recognizing that LOS D may not be
achievable or cannot be maintained upon full buildout of the General Plan, due to traffic generated from
sources beyond the control of the City, the City Council shall have the discretion to only require feasible
mitigation measures that may not achieve LOS D, but will reduce the impact of any development use or
density planned for in the Land Use Element of the General Plan.

The following locations that may not achieve or maintain LOS D are as follows and therefore will be exempt
from the LOS D policy:

      SR-29 through the City

      American Canyon Road from SR-29 to Flosden Road / Newell Drive

      Flosden Road south of American Canyon Road

Guiding Policy 1.11: Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled. Through layout of land uses, improved alternate
modes, and provision of more direct routes, strive to reduce the total vehicle miles traveled by City residents.

Implementing Policy 1.17: Regional fair-share fee program. Work with Caltrans, NVTA (formerly NCTPA),
Napa County, and other jurisdictions to establish a fair-share fee program for improvements to routes of
regional significance and State highways. This fee should reflect traffic generated by individual
municipalities/unincorporated communities as well as pass-through traffic.

Implementing Policy 1.18: Implement Circulation Map. Based on the design direction from Guiding
Policies 1.1 through 1.13, schedule and implement the circulation system identified in the Circulation Map
as development occurs. Variation from the depicted alignments for these facilities based on detailed
engineering studies will not require a General Plan amendment.

Implementing Policy 1.19: Complete Streets. When constructing or modifying transportation facilities,
consistent with Resolution 2012-72, “Complete Streets Policy of the City of American Canyon”, strive to
provide for the movement of vehicles, commercial trucks, alternative and low energy vehicles, transit,
bicyclists and pedestrians appropriate for the road classification and adjacent land use.


                                                                                                             10
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




          Update the Capital Improvement Program annually to incorporate necessary circulation system
           improvements.
          Evaluate projects to ensure that the safety, comfort, and convenience of pedestrians, bicyclists and
           transit users are given equal level of consideration to motor vehicle operators.
          Consider ways to increase and improve travel choices when reviewing development or
           transportation infrastructure projects.
          Consider roundabouts or other innovative designs as alternatives to stop signs and traffic signals
           when studying intersection configuration options.
          Require sidewalks on all arterial and collector streets. Where feasible, separate sidewalks from
           streets on arterials and collectors with landscaping including a tree canopy to create shade.
          Improve the existing street network to minimize travel times and improve mobility for transit,
           bicycle, and walking trips between new projects and surrounding land uses to reduce vehicle trips.
          Initiate modification of the General Plan Land Use Element to clearly require new development to
           bear responsibility for their proportional impact on emergency services.


VALLEJO GENERAL PLAN

The 1999 Vallejo General Plan establishes the goals and policies guiding land use and development within
the City’s Planning Area. Land use, transportation systems, environmental concerns, and economic and
equity goals are discussed with the General Plan. The General Plan also includes goals and policies for
vehicles, pedestrian and bike systems, public transit, freight movement, and congestion management
strategies. Key policies related to the proposed project include the following:

Mobility Goal – Policy 6: Prior to approval of a particular land use, it should be analyzed to determine its
impact on the existing circulation system.

Traffic Safety Goal – Policy 1: Reduce excessive speeds and amount of traffic in residential neighborhoods
through a variety of techniques, including narrowing of streets or intersections, landscaping, diversion of
traffic, and closing of streets. Innovative approaches to street design shall be encouraged as an incentive
for greater use of the Planned Development approach to land development and neighborhood design.

Compatibility with Adjoining Land Uses Goal – Policy 3: All truck traffic and regional bus service should
be restricted to peripheral major streets and north-south, east-west arterial and collector streets having the
least number of residences and schools. Only small trucks servicing the neighborhood centers should be
allowed on other streets. Where possible, unloading facilities should be provided off alleys rather than
streets.




                                                                                                            11
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




Non-Motorized Transportation Goal 2 – Policy 2: Provide safe pedestrian crossing, e.g., signalized
crosswalks and pedestrian overpasses, on major streets where day-to-day activities warrant them.
Pedestrian walkways should be provided between residential neighborhoods and high use areas such as
schools, parks, and commercial centers. The walkways should be safe for adjoining property owners and
users.

The City of Vallejo is in the process of updating its General Plan. However, for the purposes of this
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the current 1999 General Plan is referenced, since the update will not
be complete until 2016.

Traffic Impact Analysis/Study Guidelines

The City of Vallejo has prepared guidelines for traffic impact analyses (The City of Vallejo Traffic Impact
Analysis/Study Guidelines, September 2007). The guidelines include topics such as defining the study area,
obtaining traffic counts, identifying the peak periods for analysis, defining analysis scenarios, discussion of
on-site access and circulation, the intersection analysis method, forecasting traffic, assessment of traffic
impact significance, mitigation approach, sight distance assessments, assessment of impacts on non-auto
modes of travel, and assessment of the need for roadway upgrades.


NAPA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY

The NVTA serves as the countywide transportation planning body for the incorporated and unincorporated
areas of Napa County. Since the County does not have a congestion management agency, NVTA works
with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) to prepare the Napa County portion of the
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which is a long-range development plan to allocate state and federal
transportation funds. In 1999, the NVTA adopted the Strategic Transportation Plan, which the NVTA
intended to be a long-range guide for decision making and funding of Napa County roadways, transit, and
bicycle facilities. The Strategic Transportation Plan includes the following goals:

     Secure funding to maintain and improve the existing transportation infrastructure in the Napa region;

     Ensure the equitable distribution of available funding;

     Reduce vehicle accidents through the implementation of projects that enhance safety;

     Increase the role of transit in alleviating congestion and enhancing mobility;

     Enhance transit through the expansion and efficient integration of services and facilities;




                                                                                                            12
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




     Preserve the Napa region’s commitment to extraordinary paratransit service that exceeds ADA
        minimum requirements;

     Ensure that all transit services, facilities, and programs are designed for “Universal Access;”

     Increase bicycle use for commute as well as recreational trips;

     Preserve the efficiency and effectiveness of travel corridors by considering all modes in the planning,
        designing, and construction process;

     Ensure that the general objectives of the State (CEQA) and Federal (NEPA) environmental guidelines
        are used in the planning, programming, and implementing stages of project approval and
        development.


COUNTY OF NAPA GENERAL PLAN

Napa County adopted the latest Napa County General Plan on June 3, 2008. The Circulation Element of the
2030 Napa County General Plan provides existing and proposed maps of the County’s transit network,
vehicular circulation network, and bicycle/pedestrian circulation network. The 2030 Napa County General
Plan outlines three goals that address circulation and land use, state highway routes and county roads,
transit services, air transportation, rail service, navigable waterways, and non-motorized transportation:

     The County’s transportation system shall be correlated with the policies of the Agricultural
        Preservation & Land Use Element and protective of the County’s rural character;

     The County’s transportation system shall provide for safe and efficient movement on well-maintained
        roads throughout the County, meeting the needs of Napa County residents, businesses, employees,
        visitors, special needs populations, and the elderly;

     The County’s transportation system shall encompass the use of private vehicles, transit, paratransit,
        walking, bicycling, air travel, rail, and water transport.

Additionally, the following policy is included in the 2030 Napa County General Plan:

       The County shall seek to maintain an adequate LOS on roads and at intersections as follows. The
        desired LOS shall be measured at peak hours on weekdays.

        o    The County shall seek to maintain an arterial LOS D or better on all county roadways, except
             where maintaining this desired level of service would require the installation of more travel
             lanes than shown on the Circulation Map (page 127 of the 2030 General Plan).




                                                                                                             13
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




        o    The County shall seek to maintain a LOS D or better at all signalized intersections, except
             where the LOS already exceeds this standard (i.e. LOS E or F) and where increased intersection
             capacity is not feasible within the existing right of way.

        o    No single LOS standard is appropriate for unsignalized intersections, which shall be evaluated
             on a case-by case basis to determine if signal warrants are met.

The County’s interpretation of these policies with respect to this project is discussed later in this report.


SENATE BILL 743

On September 27, 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 743 into law and started a
process that could fundamentally change transportation impact analysis as part of CEQA compliance. These
changes will include elimination of auto delay, LOS, and other similar measures of vehicular capacity or
traffic congestion as a basis for determining significant impacts in many parts of California (if not statewide).

Existing rules treat auto delay and congestion as an environmental impact. Instead, SB 743 requires the
CEQA Guidelines to proscribe an analysis that better accounts for transit and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. In this proposal, the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) selected vehicle-miles traveled (VMT)
as a replacement measure not only because it satisfies the explicit goals SB 743, but also because VMT is
already used in CEQA to study greenhouse gas and energy impacts. VMT is also already used in planning
for regional sustainable communities strategies.         Therefore, the proposal is not adding a new CEQA
requirement; instead, it suggests replacing level of service with an analysis that is already widely used in
CEQA.

Further, parking impacts will not be considered significant impacts on the environment for select
development projects within infill areas with nearby frequent transit service. According to the legislative
intent contained in SB 743, these changes to current practice were necessary to more appropriately balance
the needs of congestion management with statewide goals related to infill development, promotion of
public health through active transportation, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

While the CEQA Guidelines update for SB 743 is still in preliminary form, some agencies are beginning to
adopt new VMT thresholds in order to assess impacts. Measuring VMT rather than number of trips
generated by a project places a higher weight on longer trips, which contribute more to traffic congestion
and greenhouse gas emissions than shorter trips since vehicles are on the road for a longer amount of time.

It is anticipated that the Guidelines will officially become law sometime in 2016. Typically, lead agencies
have up to 120 days to update their guidance to comply with the law, though additional time may be
available before full implementation is required. The new process will not affect projects that submitted



                                                                                                                14
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




their Notice of Preparation document before Guidelines have become law, and thus, no VMT estimates are
provided within this document. Additionally, the City of American Canyon has not yet adopted thresholds
for VMT to determine impacts.



SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA

The determination of significance for project impacts is based on applicable policies, regulations, goals, and
guidelines defined by Caltrans, Napa County, and the Cities of American Canyon and Vallejo. The impacts
of the Project were evaluated by comparing the results of the level of service calculations under Existing
Plus Project Conditions and Background Plus Project Conditions to the results under Existing Conditions
and Background Conditions, respectively. A similar comparison under Cumulative Conditions was done to
identify cumulative impacts. The detailed impact criteria for this study are presented below.


CALTRANS INTERSECTIONS

Caltrans is the state agency responsible for overseeing the State highway system, including SR-12, SR-29,
SR-37, SR-121, and SR-221. Caltrans maintains a volume monitoring program and reviews local agencies’
planning documents to assist in its forecasting of future volumes and congestion points. Caltrans Guide for
the Preparation of Traffic Impacts Studies is intended to provide a consistent basis for evaluating traffic
impacts to State facilities. According to this document, Caltrans strives to maintain service levels on State
facilities at the transition between LOS C and LOS D.


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS IN THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON

A 2011 City of American Canyon Information Sheet titled “Traffic Study Thresholds of Significance” is the
most up-to-date document specifying minimum LOS standards. Impacts are considered to have occurred
if:

         Traffic related to the proposed project results in LOS D with an average vehicle delay of 40 seconds
          or worse for an intersection during peak hour. Excepted intersections are:
              o   SR-29 / American Canyon Road (#11) and American Canyon Road / Flosden Road / Newell
                  Drive (#21), which will operate at LOS E/F with build-out development;

              o   Broadway Street / Silver Oak Trail / American Canyon Road (#20); Guiding Policy 1.6 indicates
                  that the section of American Canyon Road from SR-29 to Flosden Road / Newell Drive is
                  excepted from the LOS D threshold




                                                                                                           15
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




        Traffic related to the proposed project results in an increase of more than five seconds at an
         intersection that will operate unacceptably in the No Project condition;


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS IN THE CITY OF VALLEJO

The City of Vallejo Traffic Impact Analysis/Study Guidelines (September 2007) provides a general guide to
assessing potential traffic impacts of new developments and includes criteria for assessing traffic impacts.
Impacts are considered to have occurred if:

        The volume-to-capacity ratio increases by more than 0.04 at an intersection that works at LOS C
         without the project.
        The volume-to-capacity ratio increases by more than 0.02 at an intersection that works at LOS D
         without the project.
        The volume-to-capacity ratio increases by more than 0.01 at an intersection that works at LOS E/F
         without the project.

The LOS and volume-to-capacity ratios are based on the delay methodology outlined in the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual.


UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

Levels of service analysis at unsignalized intersections are generally used to determine the need for
modification in type of intersection control (i.e. all-way stop or signalization). As part of this evaluation traffic
volumes, delay, and traffic signal warrants are evaluated to determine if the existing intersection control is
appropriate.

The County of Napa, City of American Canyon, and City of Vallejo do not have an officially adopted
significance criteria for unsignalized intersections, however the following policy is included in the 2030 Napa
County General Plan:

        No single LOS standard is appropriate for unsignalized intersections, which shall be evaluated on
         a case-by case basis to determine if signal warrants are met.

To assess the need for signalization of stop-controlled intersections, the California Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (California MUTCD) (Caltrans, 2006) presents eight signal warrants. The Peak Hour
Volume Warrant for Urban Areas was used in this study as a supplemental analysis tool to assess operations
at unsignalized intersections.




                                                                                                                  16
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE IMPACT CRITERIA

According to the 2011 City of American Canyon Information Sheet titled “Traffic Study Thresholds of
Significance”, project impacts would occur if:

       The project results in potential conflicts for pedestrians and bicyclists;

       The project does not satisfy Americans with Disabilities Act requirements;

       The project fails to provide adequate bicycle and pedestrian access;

       The project exacerbates a current unsafe pedestrian or bicycle condition; or

       The project results in potential internal circulation conflicts for pedestrians or motorists.


TRANSIT, PARKING, AND CIRCULATION IMPACT CRITERIA

According to the 2011 City of American Canyon Information Sheet titled “Traffic Study Thresholds of
Significance”, impacts would occur if:

       The project causes transit demand above the levels able to be adequately provided by local
        transit operators;

       The project results in project parking demand that would exceed the proposed parking supply on
        a regular or frequent basis;

       The project results in an increased use of permanent neighborhood parking for area residents;

       The project results in interference with traffic flow on public streets at site access driveways;

       The project results in insufficient or inadequate accessibility for delivery or service vehicles that
        would interfere with traffic flow; or

       The project results in circulation patterns that are inconsistent with General Plan policies.


THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

According to Appendix G, Environmental Checklist, of the CEQA Guidelines, transportation impacts resulting
from the implementation of the proposed project would be considered significant if the project would:

    a) Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance or policy establishing measures of effectiveness for the
        performance of the circulation system, taking into account all modes of transportation including
        mass transit and non-motorized travel and relevant components of the circulation system, including

                                                                                                                17
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




         but not limited to intersections, streets, highways and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and
         mass transit?
    b) Conflict with an applicable congestion management program, including, but not limited to level of
         service standards and travel demand measures, or other standards established by the county
         congestion management agency for designated roads or highways?
    c)   Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in
         location that results in substantial safety risks?
    d) Substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
         intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment)?
    e) Result in inadequate emergency access?
    f)   Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian
         facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities?

In the context of Checklist Item a), for the purposes of determining significant impacts, the following criteria
will be used:

        At a signalized intersection on a State facility outside of the City of American Canyon (intersections
         #1, #2, #3, #4, #14, #15, #24, and #25), degrade the AM or PM peak hour level of service from an
         acceptable LOS C or better to LOS D, E, or F;
        At a signalized intersection on a City of American Canyon facility (intersections #6, #7, #8, #10, #19,
         and #22), degrade the AM or PM peak hour level of service from an acceptable LOS D with an
         average vehicle delay of 40 seconds or better to LOS D with an average vehicle delay of 40 seconds
         or worse, LOS E, or LOS F;
        At a signalized intersection on a City of Vallejo facility (intersections #12, #13, and #23), increase
         the volume-to-capacity ratio more than:
             o   0.04 at an intersection that works at LOS C without the project.
             o   0.02 at an intersection that works at LOS D without the project.
             o   0.01 at an intersection that works at LOS E/F without the project.
        For all study intersections, traffic related to the proposed project results in an increase of more than
         five seconds or adds more than 50 vehicles per hour in the AM or PM peak hour at an intersection
         that will operate at LOS E or F in the No Project condition (excluding excepted intersections #11,
         #20, and #21);

No single LOS standard is appropriate for unsignalized intersections (intersections #9, #16, #17, #18, and
#26), which shall be evaluated on a case-by case basis to determine if signal warrants are met.




                                                                                                               18

Additionally, a construction impact to the circulation system will be significant if it adversely affects
transportation circulation or infrastructure conditions. Impacts specific to construction would be significant
if:

         The construction activity causes substantial adverse effects to vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle
          circulation;
         The construction activity causes substantial adverse effects to pavement conditions.

In the context of Checklist Item d), for the purposes of determining significant impacts, the following criteria
will be observed:

         The project results in interference with traffic flow on public streets at site access driveways via
          queuing at adjacent intersections;
         The project results in potential internal circulation conflicts for pedestrians or motorists; and
         The project results in insufficient or inadequate accessibility for delivery or service vehicles that
          would interfere with traffic flow.

In the context of Checklist Item f), for the purposes of determining significant impacts, the following criteria
will be observed:

         The project results in potential conflicts for pedestrians and bicyclists;
         The project does not satisfy Americans with Disabilities Act requirements;
         The project fails to provide adequate bicycle and pedestrian access;
          The project exacerbates a current unsafe pedestrian or bicycle condition; and
          The project causes transit demand above the levels able to be adequately provided by local transit
           operators.

2.      EXISTING CONDITIONS

This chapter describes the Existing Conditions of the roadway facilities, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities, and
transit service near the Project site. It also presents existing traffic volumes and operations for the study
intersections with the results of level of service calculations.



EXISTING STREET SYSTEM

Regional vehicular access to the Project area is provided by State Route 12 (SR-12) and State Route 29 (SR-
29) while local access is provided via Rio Del Mar, Newell Drive, and Rolling Hills Drive. Interstate 80 (I-80)
and State Route 37 (SR-37) facilitate regional access to SR-12 and SR-29; these and other major roadways
in the study area are described as follows. Local facilities are briefly described in Table 3.

Interstate 80 (I-80) is an east-west divided freeway with four westbound lanes and four eastbound lanes. It
is part of the Interstate Highway System, providing regional access to and from Sacramento, Solano, Contra
Costa, Alameda, and San Francisco Counties. The posted speed limit along I-80 is 65 miles per hour (mph).

State Route 12 (SR-12) is an east-west, two- to four-lane state highway that connects to I-80 in Fairfield and
to U.S. 101 in Santa Rosa. SR-12 passes to the northeast of the site, merging with State Route 29 between
Airport Boulevard and State Route 121. A 3-mile stretch of SR-12 was recently widened east of SR-29 from
two to four lanes. SR-12 provides access to the Project site from Solano and Sacramento Counties to the
east and Napa and Sonoma Counties to the west. The posted speed limit along SR-12 varies from 55 mph
to 60 mph in the vicinity of the Project.

State Route 29 (SR-29) is a north-south, four-lane divided state highway that connects Interstate 80 to the
cities of Vallejo, American Canyon, and Napa to the north. SR-29 passes to the west of the site and will
provide the primary regional access for the Project. The posted speed limit along SR-29 varies from 50 mph
to 55 mph in the vicinity of the Project.

State Route 37 (SR-37) is an east-west, four-lane freeway in the vicinity of the Project that connects to
Interstate 80 in Vallejo and to U.S. 101 in Novato. SR-37 passes to the south of the City of American Canyon.
The posted speed limit on SR-37 is 65 mph.

State Route 121 (SR-121) is a north-south, two- to four-lane state highway that connects to State Route
128 northeast of the City of Napa and to State Route 37 near Novato. SR-121 passes to the north of the
site, merging with SR-29 and SR-12 briefly. The posted speed limit on the street is 55 mph.



                                                                                                              21
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




State Route 221 (SR-221) is a north-south, four-lane divided state highway that connects SR-29 to SR-121
southeast of downtown Napa. SR-221 passes north of the site. The posted speed limit on the street in the
vicinity of SR-29 is 55 mph.

Several roadway network changes are called for by the Napa County General Plan, the American Canyon
General Plan Circulation Element Update, and MTC’s Transportation 2035 Plan for the San Francisco Bay
Area. The most recent document summarizing the planned roadway network changes is the State Route


                                                                                                                    22

29 Gateway Corridor Improvement Plan, published in October 2014 by the NVTA (then NCTPA). These
documents call for widening of SR-29 to three lanes in each direction from the SR-221 interchange to the
southern County Line. A flyover ramp would be constructed for traffic traveling from southbound SR-221
(Napa-Vallejo Highway) to southbound SR-12 / SR-29. A grade-separated diamond interchange is planned
at the SR-29 / SR-12 / Airport Boulevard intersection. Additionally, an extension of Newell Drive to connect
the existing section to SR-29 and provide additional north-south vehicle capacity through the City is
proposed in the Circulation Element.

With respect to the Soscol flyover ramp, Caltrans has studied potential improvements to this intersection
and released a Draft EIR in April 2015 that studies two alternatives: a partial and a fully grade-separated
interchange. The partial grade-separated solution would involve a flyover in the southbound direction only,
allowing southbound traffic on SR-221 to continue free-flow traffic onto southbound SR-29. The traffic
signal for other turning movements would be left in place. The fully grade-separated interchange would
eliminate the traffic signal and construct a single-lane connector ramp for southbound Soscol traffic to flow
onto northbound SR-29, with movement onto Soscol Ferry Road restricted to right-in/right-out only. The
State Route 29 Gateway Corridor Improvement Plan recommends the full interchange configuration for the
SR-29/SR-221 (Soscol) intersection, which is consistent with Caltrans’s preference.

The Napa Pipe EIR analysis also shows several potential improvements in the vicinity of the project.
Mitigation measures include adding a second eastbound right-turn lane at the intersection of SR-29 / SR-
12 / SR-121, though this improvement is not yet planned nor funded. A second northbound left-turn lane
is proposed at the intersection of SR-29 and South Kelly Road, and a separate study is evaluating the
addition of a dedicated eastbound right-turn lane from Devlin Road to SR-29 at this location.

Many of these improvements have been contemplated previously by the City, the County, and Caltrans, and
would be needed with or without development of the project. There is currently no timeline for construction
of many of these improvements, and other than the Devlin Road segments mentioned above, none have
been assumed in this analysis, as most could not be documented to be approved and funded.

Lastly, the City of American Canyon Traffic Impact Fee (TIF) Program was updated in early 2015. The
program is structured to cover approximately 40 percent of the estimated cost of the included
improvements and relies on Federal and State funding for the balance of the cost. Projects included in the
program include:

      Widening of SR-29 from the south City limits (just south of Kimberly Drive) to the north City limits
       (just south of South Kelly Road) and the associated intersection improvements at:

        o    Kimberly Drive
        o    American Canyon Road

                                                                                                          23

      Extending the existing Main Street

      Extending the existing Devlin Road

      Class I bicycle facilities along the River to Ridge, San Francisco Bay, Vine, Silver Oak, and Entrada
       Trails.

The transportation impact analysis does not include the completion of any of these projects, except for the
scenarios that explicitly state assumptions regarding Devlin Road extensions.



EXISTING PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES AND OBSERVATIONS

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signals and off-street pedestrian paths. Most
streets on the east side of SR-29 in the new residential neighborhoods provide sidewalks on both sides of
the street, while SR-29 and many of the non-residential roads do not provide sidewalks on either side of
the street. Some study intersections provide crosswalks and pedestrian signals, but usually not for all four
approaches. No significant pedestrian and vehicle conflicts were noted.

During data collection, few pedestrians were observed near the Project site.           Pedestrians were most
noticeable in the AM peak hour near American Canyon High School. Currently, there are no direct
connections from the new residential areas east of SR-29 to the Walmart retail area between Eucalyptus
Drive and Napa Junction Road. Pedestrians would be forced to walk to Donaldson Way and along SR-29
to access these retail areas. SR-29 has no sidewalk on the east side for a significant portion of this distance.

The NVTA is currently preparing a countywide pedestrian plan, which includes specific plans for each of the
cities within the County. The Plan is anticipated to be published in 2016.

                                                                                                               24
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS

The Circulation Element of the City of American Canyon General Plan calls for three pedestrian grade-
separated crossings across SR-29 at American Canyon Road, Donaldson Way, and Napa Junction Road.
Beyond those improvements, the Plan “supports safe, complete and well-connected neighborhood street,
bicycle, and pedestrian access and connections that balance circulation needs with the neighborhood
context…The City’s Complete Streets shall enable safe, comfortable, and attractive access for all users:
pedestrians, motorists, bicyclists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities, in a form that is compatible with
and complementary to adjacent land uses, and promotes connectivity between uses and areas.” Another
stated goal is to develop a Pedestrian Master Plan to ensure that a complete sidewalk network is installed
and that locations make sense within the context of the adjacent land uses and surrounding streets.



EXISTING BICYCLE FACILITIES AND OBSERVATIONS

Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on guidelines and design standards established
by Caltrans in the Highway Design Manual (Chapter 1000: Bikeway Planning and Design) and other design
documents. Bicycle facilities comprise paths (Class I), lanes (Class II), routes (Class III), and boulevards (Class
IIIA) as described below and shown on the accompanying figures.

      Class I Bikeway (Bicycle Path) provides a completely separate right-of-way and is designated for the
       exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized. Class I
       paths are typically eight to ten feet wide excluding shoulders and are generally paved.




                                                                                                                25
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




      Class II Bikeway (Bicycle Lane) provides a restricted right-of-way and is designated for the use of
       bicycles with a striped lane on a street or highway. Bicycle lanes are generally four to six feet wide.
       Adjacent vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permitted.




      Class III Bikeway (Bicycle Route) provides for a right-of-way designated by signs or pavement
       markings (sharrows) for shared use with pedestrians or motor vehicles. Sharrows are a type of
       pavement marking (bike and arrow stencil) placed to guide bicyclists to the best place to ride on the
       road, avoid car doors, and remind drivers to share the road with cyclists.




      Class IIIA Bikeway (Bicycle Boulevard) is a modified bicycle route providing convenient and efficient
       through route for cycles of all skill levels. A bike boulevard includes signage, pavement markings,
       and in some cases, traffic calming (e.g., mid-block closures to vehicles), and bike lanes.

      Class IV Bikeway (Cycletrack/Protected Bicycle Lanes) is a relatively new designation that provides a
       right-of-way designated exclusively for bicycle travel within a roadway. These facilities are protected
       from other vehicle traffic with devices, including, but not limited to, grade separation, flexible posts,
       inflexible physical barriers, or parked cars.




                                                                                                             26

CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON BICYCLE PLAN

For local reference, the American Canyon Bicycle Plan (January 2012), prepared by the NVTA (then NCTPA),
provides an assessment of current conditions as well as proposed improvements to the bike network. The
Plan was developed as part of the Napa County Bicycle Plan (2012), a component of the Napa County
Transportation Authority’s Countywide Bicycle Plan Update. The document serves as a guide for the
development of bikeways, bicycle policies, bicycle programs, and bicycle facility design standards to make
bicycling throughout Napa County

Existing Class I bicycle facilities within one-half mile of the Project site include Shenandoah Drive from Silver
Oak Park to Granite Springs Way, east through Vintage Ranch neighborhood, and north along Newell Drive
to Donaldson Way, and SR-29 from Eucalyptus Drive to Napa Junction Road.

The Plan also identifies several proposed bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the site. A network of Class I paths
would provide north-south access to the site via the railroad right-of-way along the western border of the
Project site, a portion of SR-29, as well as along the proposed Vine Trail alignment which extends north of
Newell Drive through the Project site. Proposed east-west Class I paths include one along Watson Lane that
follows the Vine Trail alignment and another that follows the River to Ridge Trail alignment along Eucalyptus
Drive across SR-29, where it would drop south and cut east through the southern portion of the Project site.
The Ridge Trail alignment also follows a portion of the Newell Drive extension and creates a loop through
the open space to the east of the Project site.

Several proposed Class II bike lanes would connect to the overall bikeway network in the vicinity of the
Project, including east-west lanes along Donaldson Way to Newell Drive, along Eucalyptus Drive from
Wetlands Edge Road to the proposed Class I at Theresa Avenue, and along Hess Road. North-south lanes
are proposed along SR-29 from American Canyon Road to north of South Kelly Road as well as along a
continuous series of residential streets from Cassayre Drive to Lombard Road. The City currently does not
have any Class III bicycle routes.

No significant bicycle and vehicle conflicts were noted; the relationship between the number of facilities
and the number of bicyclists is difficult to determine, though it does help to minimize conflicts.


SOLANO COUNTYWIDE BICYCLE PLAN

The Solano Countywide Bicycle Plan (2012) is a component of the long-range Solano Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP) and serves as a guide for bikeway facilities and expenditures through the horizon
year 2035. The main goal is to create a connected bicycle network throughout the County of Solano,
consisting of bikeway routes and signage as well as support programs like bicycle lockers and showers. The


                                                                                                                 27
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




Plan also makes policy and program recommendations for local application that intend to encourage,
implement, and promote bicycle transportation within for each jurisdiction. Projects shown on the Proposed
System map, consisting of approximately 148 miles of bikeway facilities, are ranked by prioritization for
funding sources on the state and federal levels, programmed through the Solano Transportation Authority
(STA). Several of these proposed facilities travel near the study area, including:

        Broadway Street (#61 Alameda Street to Napa County Line)

        Broadway to 4 lanes and Pedestrian/Bicycle Path (#70 Napa County Line to Curtola Parkway)

        American Canyon Road (#72 Hiddenbrooke Parkway to Solano-Napa County Limit)

        Suisun Valley Road (#91 Solano-Napa County Line to Mangels Boulevard)

        Jameson Canyon Corridor Bicycle-Pedestrian Route (#99 Red Top Road to Napa County Line)

        Jameson Canyon Road Bicycle Route (#100 Red Top Road to Napa County Line)


EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE

Existing public transit routes in the vicinity of the Project site are shown in Figure 3 and summarized in
Table 4. There is one park-and-ride facility planned for the City of American Canyon, though it is not yet
built.


NAPA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY

The NVTA is a joint powers agency that operates the VINE local bus, community shuttle, and paratransit
services for Napa County. There are three VINE regional routes which operate in the vicinity of the Project
site and are summarized in Table 4. Additionally, the NVTA operates an American Canyon Transit (ACT)
route that operates solely within American Canyon.

Route 11 operates between downtown Napa and downtown Vallejo, with the nearest stop at the
intersection Rio Del Mar and SR-29 approximately one-quarter of a mile from the site. The route operates
from 4:00 a.m. to 9:20 p.m. on weekdays, from 6:30 a.m. to 7:50 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 8:00 a.m. to
7:20 p.m. on Sundays. Route 21 operates between downtown Napa and downtown Fairfield, with the
nearest stop at the intersection of Airport Boulevard and Devlin Road approximately 3.8 miles from the
Project site. The route operates from 6:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on weekdays only. Route 29 operates between
Calistoga and El Cerrito del Norte BART along SR-29, with the nearest stop at the American Canyon post
office approximately 1 mile from the site. The route operates from 4:40 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on weekdays only.




                                                                                                        28

ACT is a deviated fixed-route bus service aimed at getting local residents to shopping and healthcare
facilities within American Canyon. ACT connects to VINE Routes 11 and 29 and operates from 6:00 a.m. to
8:30 a.m. and 3:35 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. on weekdays only. The route generally runs along Mini Drive, Broadway,
American Canyon Road, Newell Drive, Donaldson Way, SR-29, Rio Del Mar, and Elliott Drive in a loop. The
route runs in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions.


SOLANO COUNTY TRANSIT (SOLTRANS)

Solano County Transit is a joint powers authority that provides local and express bus and paratransit services
for Vallejo, Benicia, and Fairfield. There is one local bus route that stops in the vicinity of the Project site and
is summarized in Table 4. Route 1 operates between residential areas in northwest Vallejo and the Vallejo
Transit Center in downtown Vallejo, with the nearest stop at the intersection of Mini Drive and Elliot Drive
approximately 2 miles from the site. The route operates from 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on weekdays, from 6:45
a.m. to 7:10 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sundays.

PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS

The Napa County Short Range Transit Plan (June 2013) helps the Napa County Transportation and Planning
Agency determine the most efficient and effective use of current and future resources to meet future
projected transit needs for Napa County. This document includes a service improvement plan for the ten-
year planning horizon out to 2022. The service improvement plan consists of four basic elements: Local
Napa Fixed Route Service, Countywide Routes, Community Shuttles, and Paratransit VINEGo Service.




                                                                                                                     29
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study
June 2016




Recently Route 10, which ran from Calistoga to Vallejo, was split into two segments to reduce
unpredictability of the travel time and improve on-time performance. A new Route 11 was created from
Vallejo to the park-and-ride lot at Redwood Road and Solano Avenue in Napa, and Route 10 now runs
between Calistoga and Napa Valley College. This was the only planned improvement to the Countywide
Routes. Route 21 is a new intercity route from Napa to Suisun City that began in mid-2013. It links NVTA
routes to Solano County’s transit agencies as well as Amtrak’s Capital Corridor and Greyhound bus lines.
No other changes are planned to the Regional Routes. No changes are planned to the Local Napa Fixed
Routes that would impact the Project.

NVTA is also planning to convert ACT from a fixed-route service to a door-to-door service during non-peak
periods. Riders will be able to call ACT and request transportation to any location within the City limits. The
cost savings would increase the frequency of Route 11 during peak demand hours. There is no planned
date for these changes.

The Watson Ranch Specific Plan also indicates that a future transit route could be considered along Newell
Drive and the east-west connector to SR-29. This would likely be an extension of ACT and the roadway
cross-sections have been designed to accommodate future transit vehicles and stops, though there are no
plans from the transit providers to provide service internal to the Project.

EXISTING INTERSECTION VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS

Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak period intersection turning
movement counts were conducted at the study locations on Wednesday, May 28, 2014 and Tuesday, June
3, 2014 with area schools in-session. The single hour with the highest traffic volumes during each count
period was identified as the peak hour. Existing lane configurations and signal controls were obtained
through field observations. The peak hour volumes are presented on Figure 4 along with the existing lane
configurations and traffic control devices (stops signs or traffic signals). Detailed vehicle, pedestrian, and
bicycle count data are contained in Appendix A.

Existing intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak hour turning movement volumes were
used to calculate the levels of service for the key intersections during each peak hour.

American Canyon Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Guidelines do not require an adjustment of new turning
movement counts to account for daily or seasonal variation. Other jurisdictions, such as Napa County, do
require an adjustment of turning movement counts to account for these variations. Based on the time of
year and day of week that the data were collected, these adjustments would increase each measured count
by approximately 2 to 3 percent using Napa County guidelines. These adjustments were not made for this
study because they would have a negligible effect on the average vehicle delay at each study intersection,
which would not change LOS results.

The volumes shown for intersections on SR-29 between Napa Junction Road (#6) and American Canyon
Road (#11) do not match the traffic count worksheets because the VISSIM analysis software requires that
volumes balance exactly between adjacent intersections. That is, the number of vehicles leaving one
intersection must be equal to the number of vehicles entering the next. The adjustments made to the raw
counts are within the typical day-to-day variation of vehicle volumes, and volumes were typically adjusted
to increase the lower count in order to provide a conservative analysis.



EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE

Field observations conducted during the peak periods were used to validate the results of the AM and PM
peak hour Synchro and VISSIM analysis. Travel time runs on SR-29 were also conducted to calibrate the
VISSIM models. The travel time runs are included in Appendix A.

During the AM peak hour, there is some congestion through the corridor, particularly in the northbound
direction. However, the travel time runs show that vehicles did not have to wait through more than one


                                                                                                           32
Watson Ranch Specific Plan – Final Transportation Impact Study

cycle at any intersection through the City, corroborating the LOS C results through the corridor. During the
PM peak hour, southbound vehicles are queued at Napa Junction Road. The signals at Rio Del Mar and
Eucalyptus Drive intersections occasionally create localized queuing through the City, but the metering at
Napa Junction Road allows these intersections to generally operate acceptably.

Each VISSIM model was validated to Caltrans standards for microsimulation model variation.                    Each
intersection served 99 to 101 percent of its counted demand in the AM peak hour and 97 to 99 percent of
the vehicles counted at the intersections in the PM peak hour. Both were also calibrated to within 15 percent
of the travel times collected in the field, per the calibration targets set forth in Guidelines for Applying Traffic
Microsimulation Modeling Software (California Department of Transportation, 2002). The model was also
calibrated to try to match existing vehicle queues, particularly in the southbound direction on SR-29 where
significant queuing was observed. The SR-29 southbound queue from Napa Junction Road extended north
of SR-12/Airport Boulevard during the PM peak period.

The VISSIM models show that peak hour speeds through the corridor are much less than uncongested off-
peak speeds in both peak hours. In the AM peak hour, the average travel speed is 30 miles per hour in the
northbound direction and 31 miles per hour in the southbound direction. In the PM peak hour, the average
travel speed is 30 miles per hour in the northbound direction and 22 miles per hour in the southbound
direction. The posted speed limit on SR-29 varies from 50 to 55 mph in the study area.

Synchro calculations show the intersection of SR-29 / South Kelly Road (#4) operating at LOS B in the PM
peak hour because the model does not adjust the capacity of the intersection to account for the
downstream queue. Given that the capacity is constrained by the queue from the Napa Junction Road
intersection, the southbound approach is in queue back to the Airport Boulevard / SR-12 intersection. As
a result of this queue, the intersection of SR-29 / South Kelly Road (#4) has been designated LOS F in the
PM peak hour.




                                                                                                                 33

The results of the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are presented in Table 5. Appendix B contains the
corresponding LOS calculation sheets. The results of the LOS calculations indicate that the following
intersections do not currently operate at acceptable levels of service according to their designated LOS
standard:

       (#1) SR-29 / SR-12 / SR-121 (AM and PM peak hours)
       (#2) SR-29 / SR-12 / SR-221 / Soscol Ferry Road (AM and PM peak hours)
       (#3) SR-29 / SR-12 / Airport Boulevard (AM and PM peak hours)
       (#4) SR-29 / South Kelly Road (PM peak hour)
       (#6) SR-29 / Napa Junction Road (PM peak hour)
       (#13) SR-29 / Meadows Drive (PM peak hour)
       (#24) Fairgrounds Drive / SR-37 Westbound Ramps (AM and PM peak hours)

Additionally, the only unsignalized intersection that currently meets the California MUTCD Peak Hour
Warrant Volume for Urban Areas is the (#9) SR-29 / South Napa Junction Road / Poco Way intersection,
during the AM peak hour.
