                                       Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed-use building located at the southwest corner of
the 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street intersection in downtown Seattle. As necessary,
mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce significant transportation
related impacts that the project may have on the surrounding transportation system.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the southwest corner of Second Avenue and Stewart
Street intersection, in downtown Seattle as shown on Figure 1. The proposed project would
develop up to 177 residential apartment units and approximately 2,755 square feet of ground
floor retail.

The proposed project would provide a total of approximately 145 parking spaces and 74
bicycle spaces. Access to the parking garages would be provided via the existing alley
accessed off Stewart Street and Pine Street. Figure 2 illustrates the preliminary site plan. It is
anticipated that the development would be constructed and occupied by 2019.

The existing building on the site would be removed as part of the project. The existing
building consists of approximately 8,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 square feet of
retail.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with City of Seattle Department of Planning and
Development (DPD) staff and is consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the
study area. Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed projects, the following
intersections were selected for analysis:

    1. 3rd Avenue and Stewart Street
    2. 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street
    3. 1st Avenue and Stewart Street

Additionally, the alley access locations on Stewart Street and Pine Street were analyzed
under future (2019) with-project conditions. This study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour
when transportation impacts are anticipated to be highest. The report first describes existing
and future (2019) without-project conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the
street system, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2019)
with-project conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding
transportation system were identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the
future without-project conditions.

        Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing (2015) and future (2019) without-project conditions within the
study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system, planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service.

Street System
The following describes the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed project
and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.
Existing
Characteristics of the existing street system in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is in the immediate vicinity of three to
four lane arterials. All of the streets are one-way streets with the exception of 1st Avenue and
3rd Avenue.

Future
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) and WSDOT improvements, no funded transportation projects are identified to be
completed by the development of the project.

The Center City Connector is is propose as a modern streetcar line that will link over a dozen
Seattle neighborhoods, running through downtown and connecting the South Lake Union and
First Hill Streetcar lines. A portion of the line is anticipated to operate along Stewart Street
from 1st Avenue towards McGraw Square and SDOT is currently evaluating the design and
operations of the system. Given that the project is not fully funded and the specific details of
the design are not known, no changes have been made in the analysis related to how
operations may be effected in the study area. These elements are being addressed by SDOT
through the on-going analysis but the addition of the streetcar is anticipated to provide
enhanced multi-modal connectivity and improve overall transportation connectivity.

Traffic Volumes
The following sections summarize the traffic volumes for existing and future without-project
conditions.
Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in July 2015. Figure 3 illustrates the
existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, rounded to the
nearest 5 vehicles. Detail traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.
Future
Future (2019) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 1.5 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes
at each study intersection. The growth rate determined by discussions with Seattle DPD.
Traffic from the following pipeline projects in the project vicinity were also included in the
future without-project volume forecasts:

        2013 3rd Avenue: This project would develop 65 residential units and 1,000 square
         feet of commercial space.
        2116 4th Avenue: This project would develop 339 residential units and a 142-room
         hotel with 1,824 square feet of support retail.
        2134 Western Avenue: This project would develop 152 residential units with 6,000
         square feet of retail.
        204 Pine Street: This project would develop 398 multifamily dwelling units with 4,300
         square feet of retail.
        3rd Ave and Lenora: This project would develop 384 residential units, 196,000
         square feet of office, and 7,000 square feet of retail.
        1931 2nd Ave: This project would develop a 205-room hotel.

Future (2019) without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.


Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. Traffic operations for an
intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A through
F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and
long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria and
definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of
the intersections.




                                                                                                  5

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
(2015) and future (2019) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized
in Table 2. Trip generation is documented in the subsequent Project Impact section of this
study. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, all signalized intersections currently operate at LOS B during the
weekday PM peak hour. In 2019, with the anticipated growth in traffic, the intersections are
anticipated to experience slight increases in delay over current levels but would continue to
operate at LOS B.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from
the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2012
and December 31, 2014. In addition to the study intersections, collision data along Stewart
Street, Pine Street, 2nd Avenue, and 3rd Avenue in the study area were analyzed to evaluate
the vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle safety. This information is summarized in Table 3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high accident location (HCL) status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. As shown in Table 3 within the
analysis period, all signalized intersections and roadway segments had 2 or less collisions
per year and do not meet SDOT’s HCL criteria.

In addition, SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates
of list of “high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The
review screens the previous year’s collision for signalized intersections with 10 or more
collisions in a year and locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions. SDOT’s Draft
2014 Candidate Locations report has not identified any HCLs in the study area consistent
with the collision history review presented.


Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.
Existing
Sidewalks are provided on all streets in the study area. Marked crosswalk exists at all the
study intersections as well as other intersections in vicinity of the proposed project site. On-
street bicycle lanes are provided on 2nd Avenue along the northeast side of the street. The
2nd Avenue cycle track currently starts at Pike Street and ends at Yesler Way.
Future
Existing bicycle lane on 2nd Avenue will be converted to a cycle track between the current
terminus at Pike Street to Broad Street in 2016. The Seattle Bicycle Master Plan
Implementation Plan 2015-2019 also includes cycle tracks along 5th Avenue from Olive Way
to Denny Way in 2016 and 4th Avenue from Cedar Street to S King Street/
2nd Avenue Extension S in 2017. The 2015 – 2020 Adopted CIP includes multimodal corridor
improvements along 3rd Avenue between S Jackson Street and Denny Way such as

Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.

Existing
Bus transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit, Community
Transit, and Sound Transit. The nearest bus stop to the proposed development is located on
the west side of 2nd Avenue between Stewart Street and Pine Street providing 15 different
bus routes. Within ¼-mile of the site, King County Metro operates 47 routes, Sound Transit
operates 6 routes, and Community Transit operates 7 routes.

Within less than a ¼-mile walking distance of the proposed project during weekday peak
commute periods (6:00 – 9:00 AM and 3:00 – 6:30 PM), 3rd Avenue restricts through traffic to
transit vehicles only. 3rd Avenue is served by RapidRide C, D, and E lines as well as multiple
frequent transit lines to North, Central, and South Seattle neighborhoods. Additional transit
stops are also located on 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue, Lenora Street, and Virginia Street. The
Westlake Station in the Downtown Transit Tunnel is approximately four blocks from the site
and has frequent bus and Central Link light rail service as well as peak hour bus commuter
routes connecting the site to not only Seattle but the Puget Sound region.
Future
The proposed Center City Connector streetcar is projected to open by 2019 and anticipated
to run on Stewart Street from 1st Avenue to McGraw Square. The system is projected to
carry up to 30,000 weekday riders and will serve the City of Seattle’s three intermodal hubs
including Westlake Intermodal Hub, Colman Dock Intermodal Hub, and King Street
Intermodal Hub. The Connector will provide convenient transfers to the 3rd Avenue Transit
Spine at both ends of Downtown, to Link Light Rail via multiple Downtown Seattle Transit
Tunnel (DSTT) station entries, and to Sounder Commuter Rail at King Street Station. The line
is planned to operate from 5:00 – 1:00 AM Mondays – Saturdays and 6:00 – 11:00 PM on
Sundays. It is anticipated to provide 10-minute headways during peak periods on all days.

                                    Project Impacts
This section documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding street system and
identifies potential mitigation measures where necessary.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site. The net new trips generated takes into
account the current trips on the network, which are being generated by the existing uses on-
site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then estimating
the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level
of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




Total person trips were developed for the existing and proposed land uses based on trip rates
from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Average vehicle occupancy (AVO) was
estimated from the Trip Generation Manual for the existing general office (#710) and the
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating
Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed residential apartments and retail uses.



                                                                                                  11

Residential person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the
total person trips by the estimated mode splits from the US Census 2009-2013 American
Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting Characteristics.1 The survey shows a 20
percent auto mode split for census tract 81 where the project is located. After applying the
auto mode split, residential person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by
assuming an AVO of 1.16.2

The Commute Seattle’s 2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split report summarizes Commute
Trip Reduction (CTR) data by Seattle neighborhood. The data shows, for the Belltown
neighborhood, 30 percent of employee trips were made by auto (25 percent drove alone and
5 percent carpooled), 51 percent by transit, and 19 percent walking, biking, or other modes.
After applying the auto mode split, office person trips were then converted back to vehicle
trips by using average vehicle occupancies of 1.17.3

The retail would serve the local area including residents and employees living and working
nearby. This would result in a high proportion of walking trips to and from the surrounding
neighborhood. The analysis assumes that 15 percent of the retail customers would drive to
the site. The AVO rate used was consistent with the retail rate of 1.48 found in National
Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating Techniques
for Urban Planning.

Appendix D provides the detailed trip generation calculation. Table 4 summarizes the
estimated weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed and
existing land uses.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based on guidance
from the Director’s Rule 5-2009, OnTheMap, as well as a review of existing travel patterns,
planned improvements, and previous studies conducted in the area.

OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more
likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the expected project outbound and inbound vehicle trip
distribution for the proposed project respectively, to the surrounding local and regional street
system. The weekday PM peak hour trips were assigned to the study area based on the
travel patterns and the location of the site access. The project would provide access via the
alley way between 1st Avenue and 2nd Avenue on Pine Street and Stewart Street. The
distribution and assignment considers the primary travel routes within the gridded street
system where project impacts would be greatest. It is recognized that drivers may take
alternative routes; however, it is anticipated that impacts along these facilities would be less
than disclosed in this analysis.

The project traffic was added to 2019 future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic
volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2019 with-project traffic
volumes are shown on Figure 7.

Traffic Volume Impact
Table 5 summarizes the project traffic volume impact at the study intersections during the
weekday PM peak hour for the project site.

As shown in Table 5, the percent traffic volume impacts are less than 1 percent at the study
intersections and between 3 to 6 percent at the access alley locations. The higher project
shares are due to the low traffic volumes at those respective study intersections. Overall the
project volume impacts identified at the study intersections are within the range of daily
fluctuations in traffic, which can be up to 5 percent. The project would have the greatest
impact at the alley access on Stewart Street representing approximately 6 percent of the PM
peak hour traffic volumes.


Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as described for
existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters such as
channelization and traffic control were consistent with those used in the evaluation of future
without-project conditions. A comparison of future without and with-project weekday PM peak
hour traffic operations is summarized for the project site in Table 6. Detailed LOS worksheets
are provided in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 6, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with little to no change in calculated delays or LOS.


Alley Operations and Impact
The proposed project includes a lower and upper level garage. Access to each garage would
be provided via the alley accessed off Stewart Street and Pine Street.

The alley south of the proposed project accessed off Stewart Street and Pine Street (See
Figure 2) operates as a two-way alley and contains two garage driveways associated with the



                                                                                                                              17

101 Stewart Street Building (approximately 90,000 square feet office and commercial
building). One of the existing driveways (north driveway) is directly across from the proposed
garage entries for the 2nd and Stewart project. The south driveway is approximately 25 feet
south of the north driveway. Field observations were conducted at this alley during the PM
peak (4:00 – 6:00 p.m.) in order to analyze existing alley operations and the proposed
project’s impact.

During the peak PM two-hour period, there were 34 total vehicles observed using the alley.
Of the 34 vehicles, 4 vehicles were going to/from the north driveway, 13 vehicles going
to/from the south driveway, and the remaining 17 vehicles were either passing or unloading.
Overall, there was minimal loading activity which included two trucks parked/unloading in the
vicinity of the north driveway for approximately 5 minutes each.

The proposed project is anticipated to generate 23 gross new PM peak hour trips which is
approximately a 68 percent increase over the existing alley volumes. Included as part of the
project is a trash and residential loading area which allows those activities to occur on-site
and not in the alley.

Table 7 summarizes the anticipated alley operations, which as mentioned above does not
account for any intersection modifications due to the streetcar. The operations at the site
accesses were analyzed consistent with the above analysis. At side-street stop-controlled
intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour of traffic
and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection.

As shown in Table 7, both alley accesses are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better under
with-project conditions.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include East of CBD (Screenline
12.12) and South of Lake Union (Screenline 8) as shown in Table 8. As a conservative
estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the
screenlines would extend across the screenlines included in this analysis.




                                                                                                                           18

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
demand of the project, and parking code requirements.
Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by an upper and lower level garage with
a total of 145 stalls. Access to each parking garage would be provided via the alley accessed
off Stewart Street and Pine Street. As opportunities for transit, car share, etc. increase and
with employment in the immediate vicinity of the site, it is anticipated vehicle ownership and
the need for parking will decrease.
Demand
The peak parking demand is expected to be below national averages due the project’s
proximity to transit service and its relative location in Downtown, a high-density urban village
with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The peak parking demand for
the proposed project was estimated based on data provided in ITE Parking Generation (4th
Edition), local mode of travel data consistent with the trip generation analysis, and local
vehicle ownership data.4 This approach is consistent with approved traffic studies conducted
in the vicinity of the site. Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix E. The peak parking
demand occurs overnight.

The site is located in census tract 81. An analysis was completed to estimate the
approximate on-site peak parking demand of the proposed development accounting for each
land use’s different time of peak parking demand over the course of a typical day. Detailed
calculations are provided in Appendix E.

The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the apartment use (0.49
vehicles per unit) is based on average vehicle ownership5 from US Census data. Based on
the proposed mix of apartment units,6 the associated parking rates are shown in Table 9. A
visitor parking demand rate of 0.05 vehicles per unit was assumed based on data provided in

Note: du = dwelling units, ksf = 1,000 square feet


As shown in Table 9, the estimated peak parking demand associated with residential parking
is approximately 96 vehicles, and the peak parking demand associated with retail is
approximately 2 vehicles, totaling 98 vehicles. The peak parking demand could be
accommodated by the proposed 145 stall parking garage and could have a parking surplus of
47 stalls.

Parking Code Analysis
This section outlines the parking code requirements for vehicular and bicycle parking.

Off-Street Vehicle Parking
The project includes 145 parking spaces for the residential and retail uses. Per Seattle
Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there is no minimum parking requirement the development
as the project is located within the downtown urban center.

Bicycle Parking
Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

SMC Section 23.49.019, Table A outlines the bicycle parking siting and quantity
requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for residential,
and retail uses. Bicycle parking is not required for retail uses under 10,000 square feet.
Required bicycle parking rate is reduced in half after the first 50 parking spaces provided per
land use. The bicycle parking requirements are shown in Table 10Table 10.

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the mixed-use development
located at 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street in the Downtown neighborhood of Seattle. General
findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would construct 177 residential apartment units and 2,755
           square feet of commercial space.
          After accounting for the existing office use on the project site, the development is
           anticipated to generate 170 net new vehicular weekday daily trips with 14
           net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 17 net new trips
           during the PM peak hour.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via the alley between 1st
           and 2nd Avenue.
          All of the off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better
           with the project with minimal increases in delay.
          The two alley access locations at Stewart Street and Pine Street would operate at
           LOS C and A respectively.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The parking supply for the proposed project is 145 vehicle parking stalls and
           exceeds the peak parking demand.
          The project would be required to provide 70 long-term bicycle parking spaces. The
           project would provide 74 long-term bicycle parking spaces, which would meet the
           required parking supply.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
