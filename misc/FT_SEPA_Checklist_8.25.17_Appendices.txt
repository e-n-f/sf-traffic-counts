The purpose of this Environmental Checklist is to identify and evaluate probable environmental
impacts that could result from the Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle
Ship Supply Improvement Project and to identify measures to mitigate those impacts. “In
2015, the Port of Seattle initiated a planning process concerned with the upland assets of the
Fishermen’s Terminal property. The objective was to determine how the uplands can best
support the homeporting activity of the commercial fishing fleet. The evolving needs of the fleet
were considered along with the aging structures on the uplands. A comprehensive stakeholder
outreach program was part of the planning process. The Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway,
West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply Improvement Project would involve redevelopment of
the Gateway site in up to 86,250 sq. ft. of marine sales and services, with accessory office and
warehouse uses, the West Wall site in up to 48,200 sq. ft. of maritime flex-industrial and 33,000
sq. ft. of exterior open storage and the Seattle Ship Supply in up to 26,000 sq. ft. of workforce
and maritime incubator uses.
                                             1
The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) requires that all governmental agencies consider
the environmental impacts of a proposal before the proposal is decided upon. This
Environmental Checklist has been prepared in compliance with the SEPA Rules, effective April
4, 1984, as amended (Chapter 197-11), Washington Administrative Code; and Port of Seattle
SEPA Resolution No. 3650.

This document is intended to serve as SEPA review for site preparation work, building
construction and operation of the proposed development comprising the Fishermen’s Terminal
Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply Improvement Project. Analysis associated
with the proposed project contained in this Environmental Checklist is based on plans for the
project, which are on-file with the Port of Seattle. While not construction-level in detail, the
schematic plans accurately represent the eventual size, location and configuration of the
proposed structures and are considered adequate for analysis and disclosure of environmental
impacts.

This Environmental Checklist is organized into three major sections. Section A of the Checklist
(starting on page 1) provides background information concerning the Proposed Action (e.g.,
purpose, proponent/contact person, project description, project location, etc.). Section B
(beginning on page 9) contains the analysis of environmental impacts that could result from
implementation of the proposed project, based on review of major environmental parameters.
This section also identifies possible mitigation measures. Section C (page 43) contains the
signature of the proponent, confirming the completeness of this Environmental Checklist.

Relevant project analyses that served as a basis for this Environmental Checklist include: the
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Worksheet (EA, 2017), Historic/Cultural Resources Analysis (CRC,
2017); and Transportation Impact Analysis (Transpo Group, 2017). These reports are on-file at
the Port of Seattle, and are included as appendices to this SEPA Checklist.

       The Port of Seattle is proposing redevelopment in three portions of the approximately
       76-acre Fishermen’s Terminal. Proposed redevelopment at the Gateway, West Wall
       and Seattle Ship Supply sites is described below and summarized in Table 1.

       Gateway

       Building, Uses and Design

          The Gateway redevelopment would consist of a new up to 45-foot high, 86,250-sq. ft.
          building. The proposal would include: 21,000 sq. ft. of marine sales and services,
          55,000 sq. ft. of warehouse and 10,250 sq. ft. of office uses (see Figure 1 for the
          conceptual site plan). Building design would consider contextual materials that relate
          to the surrounding maritime industrial setting.

       Circulation and Parking

          Parking would be provided for the Gateway redevelopment within the existing
          surface parking stalls in Fishermen’s Terminal.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply Improvement Project
       West Wall

       Building, Uses and Design

          The West Wall redevelopment would consist of a new up to 35-foot high, 48,200-sq.
          ft. building. Maritime flex-industrial uses consisting of light-industrial small business
          uses supporting water-related activities are proposed in the new building. Such uses
          could include warehouse, light manufacturing, general commercial, and accessory
          office. The proposal would also include 33,000 sq. ft. of exterior open storage (see
          Figure 1 for the conceptual site plan). Like the new Gateway building, building
          design would consider contextual materials that relate to the surrounding maritime
          industrial setting.

       Circulation and Parking

          Parking for 20 vehicles and a bike lane would be provided along 21st Avenue W.
          Parking for additional vehicles would be provided for the West Wall redevelopment
          within the existing surface parking stalls in the Fishermen’s Terminal.

       Seattle Ship Supply

       Building, Uses and Design

          The Seattle Ship Supply redevelopment would consist of renovating the existing
          26,000-sq. ft. building and constructing a new up to 35-foot high, approximately
          8,000-sq. ft. addition for workforce and maritime incubator uses including uses that
          further maritime job generation, and could include maritime training space. The
          incubator space could include workshop/warehouse space for light fabrication and
          accessory office space with business support resources for early stage maritime-
          related businesses (see Figure 1 for the conceptual site plan). Like the new
          Gateway and West Wall buildings, building design would likely consider contextual
          materials that relate to the surrounding maritime industrial setting, although the
          design has yet to be finalized.

       Circulation and Parking

          Parking for vehicles would be provided for the Seattle Ship Supply redevelopment
          within the existing surface parking stalls in Fishermen’s Terminal.

         Flat, rolling, hilly, steep slopes, mountainous, other:

           Fishermen’s Terminal, including the three project sites (Gateway, West Wall, and
           Seattle Ship Supply), is relatively flat. However, on the City of Seattle GIS
           Environmentally Critical Area Map layers, a designated Steep Slope area runs from
           north to south along the west side of the West Wall site.

      b. What is the steepest slope on the site (approximate percent slope)?

           The steep slope area adjacent to the West Wall site is the steepest slope on the
           Fishermen’s Terminal site and is essentially a vertical slope.

      c. What general types of soils are found on the site (for example, clay, sand, gravel,
         peat, muck)? If you know the classification of agricultural soils, specify them and
         note any agricultural land of long-term commercial significance and whether the
         proposal results in removing any of these soils.

           Fishermen’s Terminal is entirely fill with marine deposits approximately 15 feet below
           existing grade. Underlying the soft clay and organic soils are glacial deposits consisting
                                                                 2
           of hard silt and clay and very dense sand and gravel.

           No agricultural land of long-term commercial significance is present at the terminal.

      d. Are there surface indications or history of unstable soils in the immediate
         vicinity? If so, describe.

         The Puget Sound region is a seismically active region; thus, Fishermen’s Terminal could
         experience seismic activity, which may cause surface rupture, liquefaction and
         subsidence and landslides. All of the terminal east of 21st Avenue W is a Liquefaction
         Prone area, 3 including the proposed Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply
         sites. Liquefaction Prone areas are environmentally critical areas usually associated with
         a shallow groundwater table that lose substantial strength during earthquakes.
      e. Describe the purpose, type, and approximate quantities and total affected area of
         any filling, excavation, and grading proposed. Indicate source of fill.

           Grading and site disturbance would be required for the Fishermen’s Terminal
           Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply Improvement Project; estimates are
           provided below (see Table 2 for details). Ground and site disturbance will take place in
           existing improved, impervious areas. As shown in this table, construction of the three
           site areas (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply) would require a total of

        approximately 37,870 CY of cut and the same amount of fill. A total of approximately
        37,260 SY of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) would be removed and approximately 21,320 SY of
        HMA would be replaced. A total of 2,950 SY of demolition would be required, all on the
        Gateway site (all three buildings on this site would be demolished and removed). An
        approved source would be used for the fill necessary for site redevelopment.

        1. HMA areas - assumed that all asphalt would be demolished and replaced
        2. Grading - assumed a minimum 1.5-foot thick cut section for all areas except under existing
        buildings and the West Wall building pad.
        3. West Wall building site – conservatively assumed removal of 15 feet of unsuitable material
        in the building footprint area only (does not include areas for general storage or other onsite
        improvements).

        The anticipated foundation size, depth and spacing for the proposed buildings at the
        Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply sites are described in Table 3.

   f.   Could erosion occur as a result of clearing, construction, or use? If so, generally
        describe.

        Erosion is possible in conjunction with any construction activity. Site work would expose
        soils, but the implementation of a Temporary Erosion Sedimentation Control (TESC)

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
        plan would minimize potential impacts. Once the buildings are operational, no erosion is
        anticipated because soils would not be exposed.

     g. About what percent of the site will be covered with impervious surfaces after project
        construction (for example, asphalt or buildings)?

        Approximately 98 percent of the Fishermen’s Terminal would be covered in impervious
        surfaces after project construction, slightly more than under existing conditions.
        Pervious surfaces that would be disturbed would primarily include landscaping areas.
        The City of Seattle Department of Construction and Inspection’s (SDCI) GIS indicates
        that approximately 2.9 percent of the terminal is covered in tree canopy. 4 Some of this
        canopy would be removed for redevelopment of the Gateway site, and a small amount
        of pervious area/vegetated area on the rockery could be removed for redevelopment on
        the West Wall site.

     h. Proposed measures to reduce or control erosion, or other impacts to the earth, if
        any:

        The following proposed mitigation measure applies to redevelopment at all the project
        sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply).

             Comprehensive Drainage Control Plans (including Construction Best Management
              Practices and Erosion and Sediment Control Plans) would be submitted as part of
              Building Permit applications, in accordance with City of Seattle requirements.

2.      Air
     a. What type of emissions to the air would result from the proposal (i.e., dust,
        automobile, odors, industrial wood smoke) during construction and when the
        project is completed? If any, generally describe and give approximate quantities
        if known.

        The proposed projects could result in localized increases in air emissions (primarily
        carbon monoxide and dust) due to construction vehicles, equipment and activities.

        To evaluate the climate change impacts of the proposed projects, Greenhouse Gas
        Emissions Worksheets were prepared to estimate the emissions footprint for the lifecycle
        of the projects on a gross-level basis. The emissions estimates use the combined
        emissions from the following sources:

                 Embodied Emissions – extraction, processing, transportation, construction and
                  disposal of materials and landscape disturbance;
                 Energy-related Emissions – energy demands created by the development after it
                  is completed; and,
                 Transportation-related Emissions – transportation demands created by the
                  development after it is completed.

  Improvement Project
          The Worksheet estimates are based on building use and size. The estimated lifespan
          emissions for each of the proposed redevelopment projects are listed below (see
          Appendix A to this Checklist for the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Worksheets)

          Gateway
                                     5
          Approximately 63,395 MTCO2e lifespan emissions.

          West Wall
          Approximately 94,743 MTCO2e lifespan emissions.

          Seattle Ship Supply
          Approximately 24,974 MTCO2e lifespan emissions.

          The estimated lifespan emissions for the three projects would total approximately
          183,112 MTCO2e.

          The proposed projects would be designed to conform to applicable regulations and
          standards of agencies regulating air quality in Seattle, including: the Environmental
          Protection Agency (EPA), Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) and the
          Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA).

      b. Are there any off-site sources of emissions or odor that may affect your proposal?
         If so, generally describe.

          There are no off-site sources of air emissions or odors that may affect the proposed
          projects.

      c. Proposed measures to reduce or control emissions or other impacts to air, if any:

          The following proposed mitigation measures apply to redevelopment at all the project
          sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply). These measures could be
          implemented to control emissions and/or dust during construction:

             Using well-maintained equipment would reduce emissions from construction
              equipment and construction-related trucks as would avoiding prolonged periods of
              vehicle idling.

             Using electrically operated small tools in place of gas powered small tools, wherever
              feasible.

             Trucking building materials to and from the project site could be scheduled and
              coordinated to minimize congestion during peak travel times associated with
              adjacent roadways.

     MTCO2e is defined as Metric Ton Carbon Dioxide Equivalent; equates to 2204.62 pounds of CO2. This is a
    standard measure of amount of CO2 emissions reduced or sequestered. Carbon is not the same as Carbon
    Dioxide. Sequestering 3.67 tons of CO2 is equivalent to sequester one ton of carbon.

3.      Water
     a. Surface:
        1) Is there any surface water body on or in the immediate vicinity of the site
           (including year-round and seasonal streams, saltwater, lakes, ponds,
           wetlands)? If yes, describe type and provide names. If appropriate, state what
           stream or river it flows into.

           Yes, Fishermen’s Terminal is located adjacent to Salmon Bay and Lake Washington
           Ship Canal, which connect to Puget Sound.

        2) Will the project require any work over, in, or adjacent to
           (within 200 feet) the described waters? If yes, please describe and attach
           available plans.

           Gateway
           The Gateway project would not require work over, in or adjacent to (within 200 feet)
           of Salmon Bay.

           West Wall
           The West Wall project is located approximately 70 feet west of Salmon Bay and is in
           the Urban Maritime Shoreline Environment. The proposal would require work within
           this area (e.g., grading, asphalt removal and construction). However, no work over or
           in the water would be required.

           Seattle Ship Supply
           The Seattle Ship Supply project is located approximately 60 feet south of Salmon
           Bay and is in the Urban Maritime Shoreline Environment. The proposal would require
           work within this area (e.g. grading, asphalt removal and construction). However, no
           work over or in the water would be required.

        3) Estimate the amount of fill and dredge material that would be placed in or
           removed from surface water or wetlands and indicate the area of the site that
           would be affected. Indicate the source of fill material.

           No fill or dredge material would be placed in or removed from any surface water
           body with the proposed projects.

        4) Will the proposal require surface water withdrawals or diversions? Give
           general description, purpose, and approximate quantities if known.

           No. The proposed projects would not require any surface water withdrawals or
           diversions.

  Improvement Project
       5) Does the proposal lie within a 100-year floodplain? If so, note location on the
          site plan.

          No, the project sites do not lie within a 100-year floodplain and are not identified as a
          flood prone area on the City of Seattle Environmentally Critical Areas map layers.

       6) Does the proposal involve any discharges of waste materials to surface
          waters? If so, describe the type of waste and anticipated volume of discharge.

          No. There would be no discharge of waste materials to surface waters.

   b. Ground:
      1) Will ground water be withdrawn, or will water be discharged to ground water?
         If so, give a general description of the well, proposed uses and approximate
         quantities withdrawn from the well. Will water be discharged to groundwater?
         Give general description, purpose, and approximate quantities if known.

          No groundwater would be withdrawn or water discharged to ground water.

       2) Describe waste material that will be discharged into the ground from septic
          tanks or other sources; industrial, containing the following chemicals;
          agricultural; etc.). Describe the general size of the system, the number of such
          systems, the number of houses to be served (if applicable), or the number of
          animals or humans the system(s) are expected to serve.

          Waste material would not be discharged into the ground from septic tanks or other
          sources. The proposed buildings would connect to the City’s sewer system and
          would discharge directly to the sewer system.

   c. Water Runoff (including storm water):
      1) Describe the source of runoff (including storm water) and method of collection
         and disposal, if any (include quantities, if known). Where will this water flow?
         Will this water flow into other waters? If so, describe.

          Existing and new impervious surfaces constructed on the three sites are and would
          continue to be the source of runoff from the proposed projects.

       2) Could waste materials enter ground or surface waters? If so, generally
          describe.

          No. The proposed stormwater drainage control systems and associated mitigation
          measures would prevent waste materials from entering ground water or surface
          waters.

  Improvement Project
       3) Does the proposal alter or otherwise affect drainage patterns in the vicinity of
          the site? If so, describe.

          No, the projects would not alter or otherwise affect drainage patterns in the site
          vicinity.

   d. Proposed measures to reduce or control surface, ground, and runoff water
      impacts, if any:

       The following proposed mitigation measures apply to redevelopment at all the project
       sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply).

             Stormwater from new impervious surfaces would be mitigated per the City’s
              current stormwater code.

             The proposed projects would require City approval of Comprehensive Drainage
              Control Plans (including Construction Best Management Practices, Erosion and
              Sediment Control approvals) as part of the building permit processes.

  Improvement Project
     b. What kind and amount of vegetation will be removed or altered?
        Gateway
        Ornamental landscaping in the existing project area would be removed for the proposed
        project. Some of the trees located in the parking area onsite would be removed as well.
        The project would adhere to the City of Seattle’s mitigation requirements if any
        exceptional trees are removed.

        West Wall
        Existing groundcover on the rockery in the west portion of the West Wall site may need
        to be removed for the proposed project.

        Seattle Ship Supply
        No vegetation would be removed for the proposed project at the Seattle Ship Supply
        site.

     c. List threatened or endangered species known to be on or near the site.

        No known threatened or endangered plant species are located on or proximate to the
        project sites.

     d. Proposed landscaping, use of native plants, or other measures to preserve or
        enhance vegetation on the site, if any:

        Landscaping would be provided for all three projects that would meet the requirements
        of the Seattle Land Use Code.

     e. List all noxious weeds and invasive species known to be on or near the site.

        English ivy is an invasive species that is present on the Gateway and West Wall sites.
        Milfoil could be present beneath the docks and in the water in Salmon Bay adjacent to
        the project sites.

5.      Animals
     a. Circle (underlined) any birds and animals that have been observed on or near the
        site or are known to be on or near the site:
        birds: songbirds, hawk, heron, eagle, other: seagulls, pigeons.
        mammals: deer, bear, elk, beaver, other: small mammals.
        fish: bass, salmon, trout, herring, shellfish.

        Birds and small mammals tolerant of urban conditions may use and may be present on
        and near Fishermen’s Terminal. Mammals likely to be present include: raccoon, eastern
        gray squirrel, mouse, rat, opossum, muskrat and feral cats.

        Birds common to the area include: European starling, house sparrow, rock dove,
        American crow, seagull, western gull, Canada goose, American robin, and house finch.

  Improvement Project
        Salmonid species, including Chinook, coho and sockeye salmon and steel head trout,
        are present in Salmon Bay. Other fish species and benthic animals occupy the bay as
        well.

     b. List any threatened or endangered species known to be on or near the site.
        .
        Chinook salmon and Puget Sound steelhead trout are listed as threatened under the
        federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). Puget Sound coho salmon are considered an
        ESA species of concern.

     c. Is the site part of a migration route? If so, explain.

        Yes. Anadromous salmonids living in the Cedar-Sammamish Basin use Salmon Bay as
        part of a migratory passageway to and from saltwater. Adult salmon use the bay and
        Ship Canal system as a migration corridor to upstream spawning grounds. No in water
        work or over water structures are proposed in Salmon Bay for the Fishermen’s Terminal
        Redevelopment projects, and the proposed stormwater control systems would minimize
        impacts on fisheries resources.

        The entire Puget Sound area is within the Pacific Flyway, which is a major north-south
        flyway for migratory birds in America—extending from Alaska to Patagonia. Every year,
        migratory birds travel some or all this distance both in spring and in fall, following food
        sources, heading to breeding grounds or travelling to overwintering sites. The proposed
        buildings would be of a similar height to adjacent structures; therefore, no impacts on the
        Pacific Flyway migration route are expected.

     d. Proposed measures to preserve or enhance wildlife, if any:

        The following proposed mitigation measure applies to redevelopment at all the sites
        (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply).

           Temporary and permanent stormwater control system plans (including construction
            BMPs and erosion and sediment control approvals) would be implemented, which
            would limit stormwater impacts on fisheries resources.

     e. List any invasive animal species known to be on or near the site.

        Invasive species found in King County include European starling, house sparrow and
        eastern gray squirrel.

6.      Energy and Natural Resources
     a. What kinds of energy (electric, natural gas, oil, wood stove, solar) will be used to
        meet the completed project’s energy needs? Describe whether it will be used for
        heating, manufacturing, etc.

        Electricity and natural gas are the primary sources of energy that would serve the
        proposed projects. During operation, these energy sources would be used for project
        heating, cooling, hot water and lighting.

   b. Would your project affect the potential use of solar energy by adjacent
      properties? If so, generally describe.

       No. The proposed project would not affect adjacent properties use of solar energy.

   e. What kinds of energy conservation features are included in the plans of this
      proposal? List other proposed measures to reduce or control energy impacts, if
      any:

       The following proposed mitigation measure applies to redevelopment at all the project
       sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply).

          Where feasible, building systems could include high efficiency mechanical systems,
           rain water harvesting, solar hot water, photovoltaics, stormwater control through
           green roofs and/or landscape features.

7. Environmental Health
   a. Are there any environmental health hazards, including exposure to toxic
      chemicals, risk of fire and explosion, spill, or hazardous waste that could occur as
      a result of this proposal? If so, describe.

       Exposure to hazardous site materials (soil and groundwater) and building materials
       could occur with the Fisherman’s Terminal Redevelopment project.

       1) Describe any known or possible contamination at the site from present or past
          uses.

           Soil and Groundwater
           Many locations at Fishermen’s Terminal could be considered Areas of Concern
           (AOC) for soil and groundwater contamination from past uses. However, it is likely
           that many of these areas have no residual contamination. There are three different
           categories of AOCs:

              Potential Sources of Petroleum Contamination: this includes above-ground and
               underground storage tanks, piping, garages and net tarring facilities.

              Shops and Industrial Process Areas: this includes non-descript “shops” and a
               “factory” and better described facilities, including machine shops, paint shops,
               boiler shops, a tin shop, a battery shop, a toll shop and boilers. These shops and
               areas may have used chemicals that could result in soil or groundwater
               contamination, if released.

              Other Possible Contaminant Sources: this includes historic fills, an incinerator, a
               foundry, a kiln and two blacksmith shops. Electrically powered shop equipment

                 that have heavy power demand may require transformers and capacitators with
                 the possibility of PCB releases.

             Below are descriptions of the Areas of Concern:

             Gateway
             Former shops and industrial process areas are present in the west part of the
             Gateway site and at the south end of a former canal that passed through the site
             (between the vacant bank building and Net Shed 8). A potential source of petroleum
             contamination, as well as former shops and industrial process areas are located
             between Net Shed 7 and Net Shed 6 (see Figure 4). 6

             West Wall
             No Areas of Concern were identified at the West Wall site. However, given the past
             industrial and commercial uses at Fishermen’s Terminal, soil and groundwater
             contamination could be present at this location.

             Seattle Ship Supply
             Former shops and industrial process occurred in the Seattle Ship Supply building.
             Other possible contaminant sources are present in the south part of the site (see
             Figure 4). 7

             Buildings

             Gateway
             Limited “good faith” inspections of the three existing buildings on the Gateway site
             (bank building/C-12, Net Shed 7 and Net Shed 8) were conducted. These
             inspections detected asbestos, including in the roofing at the net sheds, and in
             asbestos board panels, tile, coating/mastic and exterior soffit texture at the bank
             building. 8

             Lead based paint was detected in the metal siding, flashing, piping ladders,
             equipment, entry doors, bollards and standpipes at the net sheds, and throughout
             the interior and on the bollards to the north of the bank building. 9

  Improvement Project
             West Wall
             No buildings are present on the West Wall site that would contain
             contaminants.

             Seattle Ship Supply
             A limited “good faith” inspection of the one existing building on the Seattle Ship
             Supply site (Building C-9) was conducted. This inspection detected asbestos,
             including in sealants, pipe wrapping, ceiling and floor tiles, a fire door, insulation and
             wallboard joints, of the building. 10

             Lead based paint was detected throughout the interior and exterior of the Seattle
             Ship Supply building. 11

         2) Describe existing hazardous chemicals/conditions that might affect project
            development and design. This includes underground hazardous liquid and gas
            transmission pipelines located within the project area and in the vicinity.

             See the identified soil/groundwater and building contamination described above and
             shown in Figure 4.

         3) Describe any toxic or hazardous chemicals that might be stored, used, or
            produced during the project’s development or construction, or at any time
            during the operating life of the project.

             No toxic or hazardous chemicals are anticipated to be produced during the projects’
             construction or operation. Hydraulic oil and fuel would be used and could be stored
             onsite during construction of the projects. If handled improperly, oil and fuel spills
             could occur.

         4) Describe special emergency services that might be required.

             No special emergency services are anticipated to be required because of the
             projects. As is typical of urban development, it is possible that normal fire, medical
             and other emergency services may, on occasion, be needed from the City of Seattle.

         5) Proposed measures to reduce or control environmental health hazards, if any:

             The following proposed mitigation measures apply to redevelopment at all the project
             sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply).

                 Contaminated soil and/or asphaltic concrete pavement would be characterized
                  as part of site clearing, grading or general excavating to select an appropriate off-
                  site disposal location.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
             A site-specific health and safety plan would be prepared that includes the safety
              requirements of WAC 296-843, Hazardous Waste Operations, and WAC 296-
              155, Safety Standards for Construction Work, to minimize the potential for
              workers to be exposed to hazardous materials during construction and to
              address appropriate handling and disposal of any soil with contaminant
              concentrations greater than the MTCA cleanup levels.

             During construction activities, possible contaminants in soil could become
              entrained in stormwater. Stormwater treatment and monitoring would be
              conducted during demolition and/or construction activities.

             If unanticipated contamination is discovered, the project would need to comply
              with applicable cleanup provisions, based on MTCA regulations.

             Spill prevention and response planning would be conducted prior to the start of
              construction to prevent and, if needed, respond to hydraulic oil or fuel spills.

             Asbestos-containing material (ACM) and presumed asbestos-containing material
              (PACM) that could be impacted by demolition/renovation activities would be
              removed by a licensed asbestos abatement contractor prior to disturbance. The
              asbestos work would be performed in compliance with Washington State worker
              protection and environmental protection regulations. See WAC 292-62, WAC
              296-65 and Puget Sound Clean Air Agency Regulation III, Article 4 for additional
              information.

             Necessary precautions (e.g., exposure assessments, respiratory protection)
              would be taken to prevent or minimize worker exposure to lead, as outlined in
              WAC 296-155-176. Demolition waste that contains lead would be characterized
              and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Dangerous Waste
              Regulations (WAC 173-303).

             Conventional dust control measures would be implemented to minimize the
              exposure of workers and the immediate surrounding populations to construction-
              generated dust.

   b. Noise
      1) What types of noise exist in the area that may affect your project (for example:
         traffic, equipment operation, other)?

          Traffic noise associated with adjacent streets is relatively high at certain times of day,
          particularly along 15th Avenue W immediately east of the site—a major arterial with
          access to downtown Seattle. The traffic noise is not expected to adversely affect the
          proposed projects. The project vicinity contains numerous industrial noise sources
          from both Port tenants, nearby industrial facilities and the facility location in a working
          maritime industrial area.

       2) What types and levels of noise would be created by or associated with the
          project on a short-term or a long-term basis (for example: traffic, construction,
          operation, other)? Indicate what hours noise would come from site.

Environmental Checklist                                                       22
Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
          The proposed project would create construction activity and equipment noise related
          to demolition of buildings and building construction.

          The project size is zoned for Industrial uses and potentially affected sensitive
          receivers in the project vicinity include residences to the west and east of the site.
          The nearest residences west of the site are located approximately 965 feet from the
          West Wall building site and 1,020 feet from the Gateway building site. East of the
          site, the nearest sensitive receivers are 1,266 feet from the Gateway site, and 2,000
          feet from the West Wall site. Commercial development occurs on Fishermen’s
          Terminal and adjacent to the planned development sites at distances of 70 feet or
          more.

          Construction noise would be short-term and would occur during daytime hours.
          Typical construction noise activities would include grading, demolition and building
          construction and would employ equipment such as dump trucks, excavators, pavers,
          generators and compressors. The foundations for the Gateway and West Wall
          building will likely require piling support to achieve necessary strength to support the
          buildings. Pile driving would occur between 965 and 2,000 feet from the West Wall
          building at the nearest residences, and 1,020 and 1,265 feet from the Gateway
          building to the nearest residence. The proposed projects would comply with
          provisions of Seattle’s Noise Code (SMC, Chapter 25.08); no noise variances are
          anticipated.

          The unique nature of pile driving noise could result in the loudest sounds being
          audible at the residences nearest this activity. This noise could be perceived by
          some people as intrusive and possibly annoying, but the low overall sound levels and
          compliance with Seattle’s noise code would minimize the potential for significant
          impacts.

          Once the buildings are operational, no significant long-term noise impacts are
          anticipated; the developments would comply with provisions of the City of Seattle’s
          Noise Ordinance.

       3) Proposed measures to reduce or control noise impacts, if any:

       The following proposed mitigation measure applies to redevelopment at all the project
       sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply).

             The project would comply with provisions of the City’s Noise Ordinance (SMC
              25.08); specifically: construction hours would be limited to standard construction
              hours (non-holiday) from 7 AM to 10 PM and Saturdays and Sundays from 9 AM
              to 10 PM. If extended construction hours are necessary, the applicant would
              apply for a noise variance.

8. Land and Shoreline Use
   a. What is the current use of the site and adjacent properties? Will the proposal
      affect current land uses on nearby or adjacent properties? If so, describe.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
           Fishermen’s Terminal is a commercial fishing facility that accommodates over 600
           vessels. Recreational moorage is also provided at the terminal. There are 20 buildings
           located on the upland portion of the terminal, with approximately 227,000 sq. ft. of office,
           retail, restaurant, industrial and warehouse space (see Figure 3). Most building tenants
           have ties to the fishing fleets or the broader maritime industry.

           Fishermen’s Terminal occupies approximately 76 acres (about half of which is upland
           area and half of which is docks/water), and is generally bounded by other industrial and
           commercial areas, including: marinas and warehouses to the north, across Salmon Bay;
           the Salmon Bay Terminals to the east; the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF)
           Interbay rail yard to the south; and commercial and retail office buildings to the west of
           the site.
           Fishermen’s Terminal is located within one of two designated Manufacturing/Industrial
           Centers in the City of Seattle – the Ballard-Interbay-Northend Manufacturing/Industrial
           Center (BINMIC). These areas are home to the city’s industrial businesses, and are
           designated as regional resources for retaining and attracting jobs, and maintaining a
           diversified economy. 12 A more detailed description of land and shoreline uses at and
           around each project site is provided below. The potential for each project to affect
           current land uses is also discussed.

           Gateway
           The Gateway site currently contains two net shed storage buildings, a vacant bank
           building and surface parking areas. Net Sheds 7 and 8 occupy the east side of the site
           and are each approximately 11,400 sq. ft. The bank is a one-story, approximately 3,370-
           sq. ft. building and occupies the west side of the site. Land uses surrounding the site
           include:
                North - W Nickerson Street and the one-story Nordby Building (Building C-2),
                   which consists of retail shops and restaurants, as well as office spaces for
                   UnCruise Adventures and the Inlandboatmen’s Union;
                East - net shed buildings (Net Sheds 6, 5 and 9);
                South - the Emerson Street Bike Trail and BNSF Interbay rail yard is located to
                   the south, across W. Emerson Place; and
                West - a two-story office building (Building C-14).


           West Wall
           The West Wall site currently contains a fenced in, open storage area for marine
           supplies. Land uses surrounding the site include:
               North - additional open space storage and a materials recycling and disposal
                  station;
               East - working berths, loading space and marina slips/docks;
               South - a surface parking area and the two-story Westwall building (Building C-
                  3); and
                                                                                              st
               West - a vegetated/landscaped slope and sidewalk area adjacent to 21 Avenue
                  W 13 immediately to the west, with retail and office buildings further to the west.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
        Seattle Ship Supply
        The Seattle Ship Supply site is currently occupied by the Seattle Ship Supply building
        (Building C-9); a surface parking area and Substation No. 6. The three-story,
        approximately 12,454-sq. ft. ship supply building is in the north part of the site and is
        presently used for storage. Land uses surrounding the site include:
            North – Dock 4 and the marina;
            East – a one-story storage warehouse and retail building (Building C-10);
            South – a one-story building with retail and office space (Building I-8); and
            West – net shed buildings (Net Sheds 3 and 4).


        The proposed Fisherman’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
        Improvement Project would be developed as marine sales and services, office and
        warehouse uses (on the Gateway site); maritime flex industrial 14 and exterior open
        storage (on the West Wall site); and workforce and maritime incubator uses 15 (on the
        Seattle Ship Supply site). These uses would be allowed by the Gateway site’s IG2
        U/45 zoning classification, and the West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply sites’ IG1 U/45
        zoning classification and Urban Maritime Shoreline Master Program (SMP) designation.
        They would also be consistent with the types and character of the land uses in the
        surrounding area on and offsite. The height, bulk and scale of the proposed buildings
        would be consistent with the sites’ zoning classifications and SMP designation and
        existing development in the area. Also, because of the topography of the site, the
        proposed building at the West Wall site would be as much as 20 feet lower than
        surrounding land uses, which would minimize height/bulk/scale impacts. Therefore, the
        proposed redevelopment is not expected to negatively affect nearby or adjacent
        properties.

     b. Has the site been used as working farmlands or working forest lands? If so,
        describe. How much agricultural or forest land of long-term commercial
        significance will be converted to other uses as a result of the proposal, if any? If
        resource lands have not been designated, how many acres in farmland or forest
        land tax status will be converted to nonfarm or nonforest use?

        No, the site has not been used as working farmlands or forest lands
        for over 100 years.

          1)   Will the proposal affect or be affected by surrounding working farm or
               forest land normal business operations, such as oversize equipment
               access, the application of pesticides, tilling, and harvesting? If so, how:

               No. The site is in an urban area and would not affect or be affected by working
               farm or forest land; no working farm or forest land near this urban site.


14  Maritime flex-industrial development would include light-industrial small business uses that support
water-related activities. The flex-component could include warehouse, light manufacturing, general
commercial, and accessory office.
15 Workforce and maritime incubator uses would include uses that further maritime job generation and
could include maritime training space. Incubator space could include workshop/warehouse space for light
fabrication and accessory office space with business support resources for early stage maritime-related
businesses.

   Improvement Project
   c. Describe any structures on the site.
      As previously described, the Gateway site contains two net sheds (N-7 and N-8), both
      approximately 11,400 sq. ft., and a vacant one-story, approximately 3,370 sq. ft. bank
      building (C-12). The Seattle Ship Supply site contains the three-story, 12,454-sq. ft.
      Seattle Ship Supply building and Substation No. 6. No buildings are present on the West
      Wall site.

   d. Will any structures be demolished? If so, what?

        Yes, all structures on the Gateway site would be demolished with proposed
        redevelopment (Net Sheds N-7, N-8 and the bank building/C-12). The existing building
        on the Seattle Ship Supply would be retained and renovated and the substation would
        be retained. An approximately 8,000 sq. ft. addition would be constructed on the south
        side of the Seattle Ship Supply building.

   f.   What is the current zoning classification of the site?

        The project sites are currently zoned as follows:

              West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply: Industrial General 1 Unlimited/45 (IG1
               U/45)
              Gateway: Industrial General 2 Unlimited/45 (IG2 U/45).

        Fishermen’s Terminal is also within the Ballard-Interbay-Northend Manufacturing
        Industrial Center (BINMIC).         As noted above, this is one of two designated
        Manufacturing/Industrial Centers in the City of Seattle. These areas are home to the
        city’s thriving industrial businesses, and are designated as important regional resources
        for retaining and attracting jobs, and maintaining a diversified economy.

   f.   What is the current comprehensive plan designation of the site?

        The Future Land Use Map in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan identifies Fishermen’s
        Terminal as a Manufacturing Industrial Center.

   g. If applicable, what is the current shoreline master program designation of the
      site?

        The West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply sites are located within the Urban Maritime
        Shoreline Master Program (SMP) designation. The Gateway site is not located in any
        SMP designation.

   h. Has any part of the site been classified as a critical area by the city or county? If
      so, specify.

        Based on the SDCI GIS mapping, Fisherman’s Terminal contains the following
        Environmentally Critical Areas.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
        Gateway
        The Gateway site is located within a liquefaction prone area. The site is also located
        within the archaeological buffer zone as defined in SMC 25.05.675H, Director’s Rule 2-
        98 (see Section 13, Historic and Cultural Preservation and Appendix B for details).

        West Wall
        40% steep slope areas are located along the west edge of the West Wall site, adjacent
        to 21st Avenue W. This area corresponds to an existing rockery and vegetated area in
        this location. The site is also located within the archaeological buffer zone as defined in
        SMC 25.05.675H, Director’s Rule 2-98 (see Section 13, Historic and Cultural
        Preservation and Appendix B for details).

        Seattle Ship Supply
        The Seattle Ship Supply site is located within a liquefaction prone area. Most of the site
        is also located waterward of the archaeological buffer zone, but portions of the east and
        south edges of the site are within the buffer zone (see Section 13, Historic and Cultural
        Preservation and Appendix B for details).

   i.   Approximately how many people would reside or work in the completed project?

        The project would not contain any residential units; therefore, no people would reside in
        the completed projects. The proposed Fisherman’s Terminal Redevelopment could
        provide a total of approximately 429 jobs: 241 jobs in the Gateway project, 107 jobs in
        the West Wall project, and 80 jobs in the Seattle Ship Supply project (see Table 4 for
        details).

         j.    Approximately how many people would the completed project displace?

               The completed development project would not displace any people.

         k. Proposed measures to avoid or reduce displacement impacts, if any:

               No displacement impacts would occur and no mitigation measures are necessary.

          l.   Proposed measures to ensure the proposal is compatible with existing and
               projected land uses and plans, if any:

               The project is compatible with existing and projected land uses and plans, and no
               mitigation is necessary.

          m. Proposed measures to ensure the proposal is compatible with nearby agricultural
             and forest lands of long-term commercial significance, if any:

               The project site is not located near agricultural or forest lands and no mitigation
               measures would be necessary.

    9.         Housing
         a. Approximately how many units would be provided, if any? Indicate whether high,
            middle, or low-income housing.

               No housing units would be provided.

         b. Approximately how many units, if any, would be eliminated? Indicate whether
            high, middle, or low-income housing.

               No housing presently exists onsite and none would be eliminated.

         c. Proposed measures to reduce or control housing impacts, if any:

               No housing impacts would occur and no mitigation measures would be necessary.

10.            Aesthetics
         a. What is the tallest height of any proposed structure(s), not including antennas;
            what is the principal exterior building material(s) proposed?

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
           Gateway
           Based on the site’s IG2 U/45 zoning, the proposed building on the Gateway site would
           be a maximum of 45 feet high. Existing structures on the Gateway site include the one-
           story bank building and the 1-story net sheds.

           West Wall
           Based on the site’s IG1 U/45 zoning and Urban Maritime SMP designation, the proposed
           building on the West Wall site would be a maximum of 35 feet high.

           Seattle Ship Supply
           Based on the site’s IG1 U/45 zoning and Urban Maritime SMP designation, the proposed
           addition on the Seattle Ship Supply site would be a maximum of 35 feet high. The
           existing Ship Supply Building is 3-stories.

           Building design for the proposed buildings would likely consider contextual materials that
           relate to the surrounding maritime industrial setting, although the design has not been
           finalized at this time.


       b. What views in the immediate vicinity would be altered or obstructed?

           The City’s public view protection policies are intended to “protect public views of
           significant natural and human-made features: Mount Rainier, the Olympic and Cascade
           Mountains, the downtown skyline, and major bodies of water including Puget Sound,
           Lake Washington, Lake Union and the Ship Canal, from public places consisting of
           specified viewpoints, parks, scenic routes and view corridors identified in Attachment 1”
           to the SEPA code. 16 It is also the City’s policy to protect views of designated historic
           landmarks. 17 And it is City policy to protect public views of the Space Needle from
           designated public places. 18 The Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and
           Seattle Ship Supply Improvement Project are not expected to result in significant
           impacts on views from City-designated public viewpoints, parks, scenic routes or view
           corridors of significant natural and human-made features; views of the Space Needle
           from City-designated public places; or views of City-designated historic landmarks, as
           described below.

           Designated Viewpoints and Designated Views of the Space Needle

           The nearest City-designated viewpoints are Commodore Park, approximately one mile
           northwest of Fishermen’s Terminal and Lawton Playground, approximately ½ mile west
           of the terminal. The nearest designated view of the Space Needle is from Kerry Park on
           the south side of Queen Anne hill, approximately two miles southeast of the terminal.
           Views from these viewpoints would not change with the proposed redevelopment
           projects because of the distance from the viewpoints and topographic separation.

  Improvement Project
       Scenic Routes

       City-designated scenic routes near Fishermen’s Terminal include:
                 th
            15 Avenue W to the east;
            W Emerson Street/Place to the south; and,
                 st
            21 Avenue W to the west of the terminal.


       The projects are not expected to affect protected views to the water from either 15th
       Avenue W or W Emerson Street/Place. The 15th Avenue W right-of-way is elevated
       above the site, and the proposed new buildings would not be expected to affect views
       toward the water from this roadway. From W Emerson Street/Place, views of the water
       are largely blocked by existing development and vegetation under existing conditions.
       The proposed Gateway building and addition to the Seattle Ship Supply building
       would, therefore, represent a continuation of this existing condition.

       The proposed approximately 48,200 sq. ft. and up to 35-foot tall building at the West
       Wall site would obscure a portion of the view of Salmon Bay from 21st Avenue W. Views
       to the east are partially obstructed from certain locations due to the presence of existing
       trees and vegetation under existing conditions. With proposed redevelopment, views of
       the water along an approximately 450 ft. span of the roadway would be replaced by
       views of the new building. Assuming the existing view of the water available from 21st
       Ave. W from W Emerson Street to the NW Dock is approximately 90 percent (minus 10
       percent for the existing C-3 Building), the view could be reduced by approximately 35
       percent following redevelopment. Approximately 55 percent of the existing view would
       remain.

       Views of Landmarks

       The nearest City-designated historic landmark is Salmon Bay Bridge approximately one
       mile to the northwest of Fishermen’s Terminal. Views toward the bridge would not be
       impacted by the proposed projects because of the distance and topographical
       separation.

       The Ballard Bridge located to the east of the site is listed in the National Register of
       Historic Places. Impacts to the viewshed of the bridge are not anticipated with proposed
       redevelopment of Fishermen’s Terminal due to the extensive development of the Ballard
       and Interbay neighborhoods over the past century, which has already significantly
       altered the surrounding landscape of this resource.

   c. Proposed measures to reduce or control aesthetic impacts, if any:

       No significant aesthetic/views impacts are anticipated with the proposed projects and no
       mitigation measures are proposed.

11.    Light and Glare
   a. What type of light or glare will the proposal produce? What time of day would it
      mainly occur?



Environmental Checklist                                                     30
Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
       At times during the construction process, area lighting of the job sites (to meet safety
       requirements) may be necessary, which will be noticeable proximate to the project sites.
       In general, however, light and glare from construction of the proposed projects are not
       anticipated to adversely affect adjacent land uses.

       Once operational, interior and exterior building lighting could at times be visible from
       adjacent land uses and streets. The amount of light and associated glare is not
       expected to differ substantially from that which presently occurs from other
       buildings/structures of similar height on and near the project sites. Stationary sources of
       light would include interior lighting, building and parking entrance lighting; pedestrian-
       level façade lighting; and security lighting.

       Sources of glare would also include any mirrored and/or glazed building facade
       materials.

       Shadows

       Seattle’s SEPA policies aim to “minimize or prevent light blockage and the creation of
       shadows on open spaces most used by the public.” 19          Areas of the City outside
       Downtown that are to be protected include:

              publicly-owned parks;
              public schoolyards;
              private schools which allow public use of schoolyards during non-school hours;
               and
              publicly owned street ends in shoreline areas.

       There are no protected open space areas that are proximate to Fishermen’s Terminal
       where the projects could block light or cast shadows.

   b. Could light or glare from the finished project be a safety hazard or interfere with
      views?

       No light or glare safety hazards or view interferences are anticipated.

   c. What existing off-site sources of light or glare may affect your proposal?

       No off-site sources of light or glare are anticipated to affect the proposed Fishermen’s
       Terminal Redevelopment.

   d. Proposed measures to reduce or control light and glare impacts, if any:

       No significant long term light or glare-related environmental impacts are anticipated,
       including for motorists on 15th Avenue W, W Emerson Street or 21st Avenue W, because
       of the proposed Fishermen’s Terminal Redevelopment projects, and no mitigation
       measures are necessary.

  Improvement Project
       However, the following mitigation measures would help to reduce overall light and glare
       from the projects as they relate to the neighborhood surrounding the site. These
       proposed measures apply to redevelopment at all the project sites (Gateway, West Wall
       and Seattle Ship Supply).

             Excessively-reflective surfaces (i.e. mirrored glass, or polished metals) that go
              beyond what is required to meet energy-related code provisions could be
              minimized on the exterior of the project buildings.

             Pedestrian-scale lighting would be provided consistent with code, function and
              safety requirements. Exterior lighting would include fixtures to direct the light
              downward and/or upward and away from off-site land uses.

             New exterior lighting could be provided by light fixtures with well shielded
              sources that have precise optical control to reduce impacts to neighboring
              properties.

12.    Recreation
   a. What designated and informal recreational opportunities are in the immediate
      vicinity?

       Fishermen’s Terminal offers year-round recreational opportunities, including:
       recreational moorage, self-guided walking tours and festivals, as well as retail shops and
       restaurants. There are sidewalks along W Emerson Place and 19th Avenue W, as well as
       sidewalks along internal streets and crosswalks at key locations within the terminal. The
       Emerson Bike Trail runs along the south side of W Emerson Place, with a connection to
       the terminal at 19th Avenue W. The Emerson Bike Trail links to the Ship Canal Trail near
       15th Avenue W, providing bicycle connectivity between the terminal and other areas of
       Seattle.

       Parks and recreational facilities near Fishermen’s Terminal and their distance from
       terminal are listed in Table 5.

   b. Would the proposed project displace any existing recreational uses?                   If so,
      describe.

       The project would not displace any existing recreational uses.

   c. Proposed measures to reduce or control impacts on recreation, including
      recreation opportunities to be provided by the project or applicant, if any:

       No significant recreation impacts are anticipated and no mitigation measures are
       necessary.

13.    Historic and Cultural Preservation

       A detailed Cultural Resources Assessment was prepared for the Fishermen’s Terminal
       Redevelopment projects by CRC in June 2017 (see Appendix B). The following
       responses summarize the findings in this report.

   a. Are there any buildings, structures, or sites, located on or near the site that are over
      45 years old listed in or eligible for listing in national, state, or local preservation
      registers located on or near the site? If so, specifically describe.

       The nearest City-designated historic landmark is Salmon Bay Bridge, located
       approximately one mile to the northwest of Fishermen’s Terminal. The Ballard Bridge,
       located to the east of the site, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places
       (NRHP).

       Below are summaries of historic/historic age buildings on the project sites.

       Gateway
       The three buildings on the Gateway site (the former bank building/Building C-12, Net
       Sheds 7 and 8) have not been previously inventoried, and therefore are not currently
       designated City Landmarks or historic resources. All three buildings are at least 25 years
       old, and meet the City of Seattle’s threshold for eligibility as a Seattle Landmark. Net
       Sheds N-7 and N-8 were constructed in 1943 and 1954, respectively. These two net
       sheds are significant on the local level and are potentially eligible as Seattle Landmarks.
       The vacant bank building/Building C-12 onsite was constructed in 1964, and meets the
       threshold for historic structures. However, the bank does not possess traits to support
       eligibility for listing on a historic register. The adjacent Nordby building to the east was
       constructed in 1955. It has not been inventoried, but meets the age threshold for historic
       structures. The bank building/Building C-12 and Net Sheds 7 and 8 would be
       demolished and removed with the proposed project.

       West Wall
       There are no buildings located within or adjacent to the West Wall site that are over 45
       years old listed in or eligible for listing in any historic registers.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
       Seattle Ship Supply
       The former Seattle Ship Supply building was constructed in 1918, but was determined
       ineligible for listing in the NRHP in 2003 due to extensive alterations and a lack of
       historical significance. However, the building is significant on a local level and is
       potentially eligible as a Seattle Landmark. Adjacent Building C-10 to the east
       (constructed in 1938) and Net Shed N-3 to the west (constructed in 1943) are at least 25
       years old and meet the threshold for historic structures; however, they are not listed on
       any historic registers. The ship supply building would be renovated and expanded with
       the proposed project.

   c. Are there any landmarks, features, or other evidence of Indian or historic use or
      occupation? This may include human burials or old cemeteries. Are there any
      material evidence, artifacts, or areas of cultural importance on or near the site?
      Please list any professional studies conducted at the site to identify such
      resources.

       Potential impacts to cultural resources with the proposed Fishermen’s Terminal
       Redevelopment projects were evaluated in the Cultural Resources Report (see
       Appendix B). Below are summaries of the ethnographic and historic context of
       Fishermen’s Terminal, and the potential for archeological sites at Fishermen’s Terminal
       and the project sites.

       Ethnographic Context

       Archeological sites dating to the early to mid-Holocene (the Holocene began about
       11,700 years before present) are more commonly found in the region. Human land use
       was generally structured around the value of natural resources available in the local
       environments, including fresh water, terrestrial and marine food resources, forests and
       suitable terrain. Fishermen’s Terminal is within the traditional territory of the Duwamish,
       a southern South Coast Salish people who spoke Southern Lushootseed; historically,
       members of the Suquamish and Muckleshoot Tribes also used this vicinity. A major
       Duwamish winter village was located on the north shore of Salmon Bay and the bay was
       a thoroughfare for Puget Sound peoples headed east to Lake Washington via canoe and
       portage seeking resources and trade with neighboring tribes. Inland peoples also
       travelled by trail to Salmon Bay in search of marine foodstuffs.

       Historic Context

       In the late 1700s, Euro-American exploration and settlement of the region began,
       including on the south shore of Salmon Bay. In 1855, following the signing of the Point
       Elliot Treaty and others, area tribes were forced to abandon their Puget Sound villages
       and relocate to reservations. In 1911, the Port of Seattle was created and in 1913,
       construction of Fishermen’s Terminal began. The terminal was envisioned as a harbor
       for Seattle’s fishing fleet. In 1917, the Ship Canal connecting Lake Union Bay and
       Salmon Bay and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks opened. The locks raised the water
       level of what was once east Salmon Bay approximately 21 feet and converted it to a
       fresh water environment. Over the subsequent decades, Fishermen’s Terminal was
       expanded and improved.

        Potential for Archaeological Sites at Fishermen’s Terminal

        Review of the local archaeological record and geomorphological setting indicates a high
        potential for archaeological sites to be located at Fishermen’s Terminal. While the
        terminal’s landscape has been modified by twentieth century development, near shore
        locations retain the potential to contain buried intact archaeological sites, which may
        have been capped by historic fill material or buried during seismic subsidence.

        SDCI GIS mapping identifies an archaeological buffer area that extends 200 feet from
        the U.S. Government Meander Line. The meander line provides the approximate
        location of the saltwater shoreline prior to recent fill episodes and landscape alterations.
        The buffer area represents the area where most potentially “archaeologically significant
        resources” are likely located. 20 Most of Fishermen’s Terminal is located within the
        Government Meander Line Buffer area.
        Below are descriptions of the likelihood of encountering cultural resource at the project
        sites:

        Gateway and West Wall
        The Gateway and West Wall sites are located within the archaeological buffer zone. In
        the past, these sites contained shoreline habitat that could have provided for longer-term
        occupation. Native Holocene sediments could potentially be capped beneath fill or
        buried seismic subsidence at this sites, which could contain buried intact archaeological
        sites

        Ship Supply Building
        Most of the Ship Supply site is located waterward of the archaeological buffer zone.
        However, the east and south parts of the site are within the archaeological buffer zone.

        (See Appendix B for details.)
    c. Describe the methods used to assess the potential impacts to cultural and historic
       resources on or near the project site. Examples include consultation with tribes
       and the department of archeology and historic preservation, archaeological
       surveys, historic maps, GIS data, etc.

        Potential impacts to historic and cultural resources were assessed by reviewing
        available project information, local environmental and cultural information and historical
        maps, as well as a site survey. Archaeological and historic data from the Washington
        State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) and the Washington
        Information System for Architectural and Archaeological Records Data (WISSARD) was
        reviewed. Contact was made with cultural resources staff of the Duwamish Tribe,
        Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, Snoqualmie Indian Nation and the Suquamish Tribe Nation on
        a technical staff-to-technical basis to inquire about project-related cultural information or
        concerns. The Suquamish Tribe responded and they did not have any specific concerns
        regarding the project at this time. On April 7, 2017, a field investigation was conducted,
        consisting of a surface survey and photo documentation of site conditions and historic
        structures anticipated to be impacted by proposed redevelopment (see Appendix B for
        details).

   d. Proposed measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for loss, changes to, and
      disturbance to resources. Please include plans for the above and any permits that
      may be required.

       The following proposed mitigation measures apply to redevelopment at all the project
       sites (Gateway, West Wall and Seattle Ship Supply), unless noted for a specific
       project(s).

          The applicant would develop and implement appropriate measures for historic
           buildings on the Gateway and Ship Supply sites in conjunction with the Seattle
           Historic Preservation Program, King County Preservation Program, DAHP, and other
           applicable parties. These measures could include the completion of Seattle
           Landmarks nomination forms to determine if the structures could be listed on the
           local register and/or completion of Level II Mitigation Documentation as defined by
           DAHP, which would include more detailed documentation of the structures’
           architecture and history, and supplemental interior and exterior photographs.

          An accurate as-built drawing of the Seattle Ship Supply building could be prepared,
           as this is not presently available, and, in-kind materials could be used or replaced for
           renovation/expansion of this structure.

          Interpretive information that would convey the historical significance of the structures
           to be removed (on the Gateway site) and renovated/expanded (on the Seattle Ship
           Supply site) could be used as public education tools and/or integrated into future
           planning and design efforts.

          Archaeological monitoring would be conducted for ground disturbance such as
           grading and excavation (including street improvements, utility installation, etc.) within
           the Holocene deposits at the Gateway and West Wall sites, as well as to the east
           and south of the Seattle Ship Supply building.

          In the event that resources of potential archaeological significance are encountered
           during excavation or construction associated with the proposed project, the proposed
           ‘Inadvertent Discovery Protocol’ identified in the Cultural Resources Report (see
           Appendix B) would be followed including:
           - work that is occurring in the portion of the site where potential archaeological
               resources are found would be stopped immediately;
           - agencies with jurisdiction over the property would be contacted;
           - the City of Seattle land use planner that is assigned to the project and the
               Washington State Archaeologist at DAHP would immediately be contacted; and
           - a final written report of the discovery completed.

          In the unlikely event that human remains are found within the project area, all activity
           would cease that could cause further disturbance to the remains, and the proposed
           ‘Protocols for Discovery of Human Remains’ identified in the Cultural Resources
           Report (see Appendix B) would be followed, including:
           - covering and securing the discovery; and
           - contacting effected law enforcement personnel.

14.    Transportation

       A detailed Transportation and Parking Memorandum was prepared for the Fishermen’s
       Terminal Redevelopment projects by Transpo Group in July, 2017 (see Appendix C).
       The following responses summarize the findings in this report.

   a. Identify public streets and highways serving the site or affected geographic area
      and describe the proposed access to the existing street system. Show on site
      plans, if any.

       Fishermen’s Terminal is bounded by three public streets: 15th Avenue W (and the Ballard
       Bridge) to the east, W Emerson Street/Place to the south and 21st Avenue W to the
       west. Primary access is provided via W Emerson Street/19th Avenue W. Secondary
       access is available at 21st Avenue W, and an industrial-user access off of16th Avenue W
       (see Figure 3). Below are descriptions of the roadways/access to the three project sites.
       Gateway
       The Gateway site is bounded by W Nickerson Street to the north, an alley between Net
       Sheds 6 and 7 to the east, W Emerson Street to the south (separated by a rockery) and
       19th Avenue W to the west. Currently, 18th Avenue W runs north-south and a parking lot
       driveway runs east-west through the middle of the site.

       West Wall
       The West Wall site is bounded by 20th Avenue W to the east and 21st Avenue W to the
       west (separated from the site by a rockery). No streets border the north or south ends of
       the site.

       Seattle Ship Supply
       The Seattle Ship Supply site is bounded by W Thurman Street to the north, 15th Place
       W to the east, W Nickerson to the south and 16th Avenue W to the west.

   b. Is site or affected geographic area currently served by public transit? If not, what
       is the approximate distance to the nearest transit stop?

       Yes, there are two transit routes operated by King County Metro near Fishermen’s
       Terminal. The nearest transit stop is along W Emerson Place approximately 750 feet to
       the west of the 19th Avenue W entrance to the terminal. This transit stop is served by
       Route 31. The terminal is also served by Rapid Ride Line D which operates along 15th
       Avenue W approximately 1,500 feet to the east of the 19th Avenue W entrance.

   c. How many additional parking spaces would the completed project have? How
      many would the project or proposal eliminate?

       There are presently 969 parking spaces within Fishermen’s Terminal. Of these, there are
       342 available spaces during the peak hour, of which 126 would be available for retail
       uses (two-hour parking) and 216 would be available for other proposed uses.

       In total, the three projects would eliminate 100 parking spaces at the terminal. The
       projects would result in a net of 126 two-hour available spaces and 216 other available
       spaces for the proposed development. During the peak hour, there would be a demand

  Improvement Project
        for 49 two-hour parking spaces and 76 eight-hour parking spaces with the projects. The
        2-hour parking has 126 available spaces, which could accommodate the anticipated 49
        vehicles associated with the proposed marine sales and services accessory retail. The
        available parking on-site for other uses is 216 spaces, which would fully accommodate
        the 76 vehicles anticipated for the accessory office, warehouse, and light industrial uses
        on-site (see Appendix C for details).


   d. Will the proposal require any new or improvements to existing roads, streets,
      pedestrian, bicycle or state transportation facilities, not including driveways? If
      so, generally describe (indicate whether public or private).

        The project would include construction of 20 on-street parking spaces along 21st Avenue
        W.

   e. Will the project or proposal use (or occur in the immediate vicinity of) water, rail,
      or air transportation? If so, generally describe.

        Given the project sites’ location at Fishermen’s Terminal, there may be some use of
        water transportation with various commercial and recreational boating services.

        Fishermen’s Terminal is situated to the north of the BNSF Railway Terminal. However, it
        is not anticipated that the projects would use rail transportation.

   f.   How many vehicular trips per day would be generated by the completed project or
        proposal? If known, indicate when peak volumes would occur and what
        percentage of the volume would be trucks (such as commercial and
        nonpassenger vehicles). What data or transportation models were used to make
        these estimates?

        In total, the Fishermen’s Terminal Redevelopment projects are estimated to generate
        1,020 net new weekday trips per day, with 175 trips occurring during the weekday AM
        peak hour and 51 trips occurring during the weekday PM peak hour. The trip generation
        estimate is based on methodology from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
        Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.

        Traffic operations at the following three intersections were analyzed:
                  th
            19 Avenue W/ W Emerson Place;
                  th
            16 Avenue W/W Emerson Place; and
            W Nickerson Street/W Emerson Place.


        The transportation analysis shows that the existing off-site transportation system would
        accommodate total proposed development of the three projects (Gateway, West Wall
        and Seattle Ship Supply). (See Appendix C for details).

   g. Will the proposal interfere with, affect or be affected by the movement of
      agricultural and forest products on roads or streets in the area? If so, generally
      describe.

Fishermen’s Terminal Gateway, West Wall, and Seattle Ship Supply
  Improvement Project
      The project would not interfere or be affected by the movement of agricultural and forest
      products on the roadway network near the site area.
   h. Proposed measures to reduce or control transportation impacts, if any.

       No impacts are anticipated and no mitigation is proposed.


15.    Public Services
   a. Would the project result in an increased need for public services (for example:
      fire protection, police protection, health care, schools, other)? If so, generally
      describe.

      No. The project would not result in an increased need for public services.
   b. Proposed measures to reduce or control direct impacts on public services, if any.

       While the potential increase in employees and visitors associated with the proposed
       projects could result in incrementally greater demand for emergency services, it is
       anticipated that adequate service capacity is available within the Interbay area and city
       as a whole to preclude the need for additional public facilities/services.

16.   Utilities
   a. Circle utilities currently available at the site: electricity, natural gas, water, refuse
      service, telephone, sanitary sewer, septic system, other.

       All utilities are currently available at the site and have adequate capacity to serve the
       proposed redevelopment projects.

   b. Describe the utilities that are proposed for the project, the utility providing the
      service, and the general construction activities on the site or in immediate vicinity
      that might be needed.

       Utilities and providers (in parentheses) proposed for the projects would include the
       following:

              Water – New domestic water connections and fire service connections to existing
               infrastructure at the Port (Seattle Public Utilities).
              Sewer – New side sewer connections to existing infrastructure at the Port
               (Seattle Public Utilities).
              Natural Gas – New gas service connections to existing Port infrastructure (Puget
               Sound Energy).
              Telecommunications – New telecommunications connections to existing
               infrastructure at the Port (Century Link, Comcast).
              Electrical – New electrical feed from existing infrastructure at the Port (Seattle
               City Light).
              Refuse/Recycling Service (Cleanscapes/Recology).

               DAHP PROJECT: 2017-04-02572

The attached short report form constitutes our final report for the above referenced project. CRC
completed updated and initial historic property inventory forms for four structures slated for
demolition (DAHP Properties 38460, 709702, 709703, and 709704). Based on CRC’s
investigations three of the four structures are significant on the local level and are potentially
eligible for nomination as Seattle Landmarks. These structures will be adversely impacted by
proposed project plans. Potential mitigation measures for these impacts are presented. CRC
recommends location specific archaeological monitoring during ground disturbing activity
should proposed project actions reach native Holocene sediments. Please contact our office
should you have any questions about our findings and/or recommendations.
