EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Transportation Impact Study (TIS) evaluates the impacts on the transportation network associated
with the proposed development of the SpringHill Suites hotel at the intersection of Shoreway Road and
Cormorant Drive in Belmont, California. Transportation impacts for ten intersections in close proximity to
the Proposed Project site were analyzed, along with three proximate US-101 freeway segments.

Traffic impacts for the identified study intersections and freeway segments were evaluated under the
following scenarios.

    Existing – Existing (2015) conditions based on recent traffic counts

    Existing Plus Project – Existing (2015) conditions plus Proposed Project-generated traffic

    Cumulative Without Project – Future forecast conditions (2040), which includes local and regional
    traffic growth

    Cumulative Plus Project – Future forecast conditions (2040) plus Proposed Project-generated traffic



FINDINGS

The study found that the Proposed Project would generate 90 AM peak hour vehicle trips (53 in and 37
out) and 102 PM peak hour vehicle trips (52 in and 50 out). It was determined that the Proposed Project
would have a minor effect on the peak hour intersection and freeway operations in the study area, based
on criteria established in the City of Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies (2012). Therefore, the
Proposed Project would result in a less-than-significant impact.



RECOMMENDATIONS

Although the Proposed Project would result in a less-than-significant impact to traffic operations, the
following site improvements were recommended to enhance access and circulation:


VEHICULAR ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

       Incorporate a loading zone with loading berth and area for turning and maneuvering vehicles.

       Identify a valet parking and/or taxi pickup station at the porte-cochere.


                                                                                                                 i

July 2015




        Designate a fire lane through the Proposed Project site.


PEDESTRIAN ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

        Provide additional openings in the landscaping surrounding the Proposed Project site along
         Shoreway Road and the private driveway on the south edge of the Proposed Project site to
         facilitate access from the surrounding street network.

        Construct a continuous sidewalk on the south and east edges of the Proposed Project site.

        Maintain tight curb radii at site driveways to minimize pedestrian crossing distances.

        Enhance the new pedestrian crossing of Cormorant Drive with high visibility markings, a raised
         crossing treatment, and advanced warning signage that is consistent with the mid-block
         pedestrian crossing on Shoreline Drive just east of the Proposed Project site. Additional crossing
         enhancements to consider could include actuated beacons and mid-block curb extensions.

        Consider relocating the new pedestrian crossing of Cormorant Drive further west to align the
         crossing with the driveway entry into the Proposed Project site at the vehicle median break. This
         would reduce the convenience of pedestrian access between the Proposed Project site and the
         Nikon Campus, but it could improve the safety of the crossing by aligning pedestrian crossings
         with vehicle turning movements at the driveway and making pedestrians more visible to drivers.


BICYCLE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

     •   Provide short-term bicycle parking for visitor use and long-term bicycle parking for employee use.

     •   Construct Class II bicycle lanes on Shoreway Road adjacent to the Proposed Project site to

         continue the existing facility one block further north.


TRANSIT ACCESS

     •   Coordinate with other local businesses or a local transportation management agency to offer a
         complimentary shuttle between the Proposed Project site and the Belmont and San Carlos
         Caltrain Stations to encourage transit use.

1.      INTRODUCTION

This Transportation Impact Study (TIS) provides a transportation impact analysis for the proposed
SpringHill Suites hotel development, located at the intersection of Shoreway Road and Cormorant Drive in

Belmont, California (herein referred to as the “Proposed Project”).


Consistent with the City of Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies (2012) (herein “City of Belmont

Guidelines”), the transportation impact analysis evaluates the Proposed Project’s potential impacts on the

nearby roadway system under two scenarios, Existing Plus Project and Cumulative Plus Project, and
discusses the adjacent transit, pedestrian, and bicycle networks. An assessment of the parking conditions,
site plan, and sight distances was also conducted.


This chapter summarizes the key attributes of the Proposed Project relating to transportation conditions,

outlines the report structure, and describes the methodology used for analysis. A detailed description of
the scope of work is provided in Appendix A.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Proposed Project site is located within the City of Belmont in San Mateo County, as shown in Figure

1. The Proposed Project would construct a four-story hotel with 169 rooms on a 3.39 acre site that is
currently undeveloped. Figure 2 depicts the conceptual site plan for the Proposed Project.

The Proposed Project would provide two vehicle access points to the site. One would be a driveway with
direct access off of Cormorant Drive, just west of the Proposed Project’s main lobby entrance; the other

would be a driveway located at the northeast corner of the site with access off of a private driveway
shared by ABS-CBN International. The Proposed Project would provide 170 parking spaces, including 5
handicap spaces.


The Proposed Project would provide a pedestrian walkway from the main lobby entrance to the Nikon

Campus entrance across Cormorant Drive, but it would not alter the existing four-foot sidewalks directly
adjacent to the Proposed Project site on Cormorant Drive and Shoreway Road. The Proposed Project

would not construct new sidewalks where they currently do not exist on the south and east edges of the

site.



STUDY LOCATIONS AND ANALYSIS SCENARIOS

Proposed Project impacts to the roadway facilities in the study area were determined by measuring the

effect that Proposed Project traffic would have on intersection and freeway operations in the vicinity of
the site during the weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and weekday evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak

periods. The weekday peak periods were chosen as a conservative analysis because they are typically the

periods with the highest adjacent roadway traffic and highest trip generation potential. Weekend peak
periods typically have lower vehicle volumes on adjacent roadways and more sporadic trips patterns (i.e.
trips are more spread out over the course of the weekend day and not as concentrated during the peak

period). The analysis periods for this study were selected with input from City of Belmont staff.


The following ten intersections were analyzed for this study, as shown on Figure 1. Similar to the analysis

periods, these locations were selected with input from City of Belmont staff. They were chosen due to
their proximity to the Proposed Project site and their current traffic levels.

    Cumulative Without Project – Future forecast conditions (2040), which includes local and regional

    traffic growth

    Cumulative Plus Project – Future forecast conditions (2040) plus Proposed Project-generated traffic



ANALYSIS METHODS

The operations of roadway facilities are described using the term “level of service” (LOS). LOS is a
qualitative description of traffic flow from a vehicle driver’s perspective based on factors such as speed,

travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels of service are defined ranging from LOS A (best
operating conditions) to LOS F (worst operating conditions). LOS E corresponds to operations “at

capacity.” When volumes exceed capacity, stop-and-go conditions result and operations are designated
as LOS F.

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

Traffic conditions at signalized intersections were evaluated using the method documented in Chapter 16
of the Transportation Research Board’s 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The HCM method

calculates control delay at an intersection based on inputs such as traffic volumes, lane geometry, signal

phasing and timing, pedestrian crossing times, and peak hour factors. Control delay is defined as the
delay directly associated with the traffic control device (i.e., a stop sign or a traffic signal) and specifically

includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. With
this method, operations are defined by the average control delay per vehicle (measured in seconds).

These delay estimates are considered meaningful indicators of driver discomfort and frustration, fuel

consumption, and lost travel time. The relationship between average control delay, driver’s perception of
traffic, and LOS for signalized intersections is summarized in Table 1. The City of Belmont Guidelines does

not define a specific acceptable level of service for signalized intersections, but it does specify a series of

significance thresholds that are described later in this report. Many communities select LOS D as the

threshold for acceptable operations, where LOS E and LOS F would be unacceptable.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

For unsignalized (all-way stop-controlled and side-street stop-controlled) study intersections, the

Transportation Research Board’s 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method for unsignalized
intersections was used. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized

intersections. At side-street stop-controlled intersections, the delay is calculated for each stop-controlled

movement, the left-turn movement from the major street, as well as the intersection average. The highest

movement/approach delay is reported for side-street stop-controlled intersections. The City of Belmont
Guidelines generally defines acceptable citywide unsignalized intersection operations as LOS D or better

during the morning and evening peak periods, although some exceptions apply, as described later.

FREEWAY SEGMENTS

Traffic conditions on freeway segments (basic, merge, and diverge) near the Proposed Project site were
evaluated using the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology. Service levels on each segment

were determined based on vehicle density and volume to capacity ratios, as calculated using the freeway

volumes and the ramp volumes at each study location. The operating characteristics of segments are
described using the concept of LOS. Table 3 summarizes the LOS criteria for basic segments, while Table

4 summarizes the LOS criteria for merge and diverge segments. Some on- and off-ramps are modeled as
basic segments when a lane is included on the mainline as a continuation of the ramp lane.

REGULATORY SETTING IN CITY OF BELMONT

The Belmont General Plan 1982 serves as the blueprint for the City’s future growth and development. The

City of Belmont is currently in the process of updating its General Plan and anticipates adoption of the
update in 2015. The following is the transportation goal of the General Plan:


    Goal 2: To accommodate each mode of transportation on a route designed and located to provide

    for the enjoyment and safety of the individual and to cause minimum interference with adjacent uses
    of land


The Circulation Element of the General Plan does not include any new major roadways or changes to the
existing system that would be relevant for this study.


CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (CALTRANS)

Caltrans is the state agency responsible for the construction, maintenance, and operation of interstate
freeways, freeway ramps, and state highways in California. Within the Proposed Project study area,

Caltrans manages US-101 and State Route 82 (El Camino Real). Fehr & Peers coordinated with Caltrans to
collect signal timing data for study intersections located on these facilities.

REGIONAL AGENCIES

The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is a regional planning agency consisting of members of
all nine counties and 101 cities within the Bay Area. The agency determines coordinated policies, provides

service programs (such as financing, risk management, and employee training), and advocates for

beneficial legislation. In collaboration with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, ABAG developed
the Bay Area’s first Sustainable Communities Strategy, called Plan Bay Area, which is a long-range,

integrated transportation and land use strategy that was approved in July 2013. The Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC) serves as the transportation planning, coordinating, and financing

agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. In April 2009, the MTC adopted the Transportation

2035 Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area, which specifies how some $218 billion in anticipated federal,
state and local transportation funds will be spent in the nine-county Bay Area during the next 25 years.

The vision for Transportation 2035 is to support a prosperous and globally competitive Bay Area

economy, provide for a healthy and safe environment, and promote equitable mobility opportunities for

all residents. More recently, the MTC worked with ABAG to develop the Plan Bay Area Sustainable
Communities Strategy as required by SB 375.


The City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG) is a county-level planning

agency consisting of members of all cities within San Mateo County. The agency studies issues that affect

quality of life (transportation, air quality, waste, etc.) and is the Congestion Management Agency for the

County. C/CAG recently published its 2013 Congestion Management Plan, which was developed to be

consistent with the recently adopted Plan Bay Area.



SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

The following transportation and circulation significance criteria are based on the City of Belmont
Guidelines.


Since the Proposed Project lies within City of Belmont jurisdiction, and many of the transportation
facilities that may be affected by the Proposed Project fall within the City, the City of Belmont’s impact
criteria were used to assess the Proposed Project’s impacts.

The City of Belmont Guidelines includes traffic level of service standards for signalized and unsignalized
intersections. These criteria and interpretations are presented below.


SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

The City of Belmont Guidelines defines a series of significant impact thresholds for signalized intersections

based on a combination of increases in control delay and the demand to capacity (V/C) ratio, which are

summarized in Table 5.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

All-Way Stop Intersections

The citywide LOS standard from the City of Belmont Guidelines for all-way stop sign controlled
intersections is LOS D. The City has also developed a series of significance thresholds for unsignalized

intersections based on average control delay, as summarized in Table 6.


Side-Street Stop Intersections

The citywide LOS standard from the City of Belmont Guidelines for side-street stop sign controlled

intersections is LOS D, and the significance thresholds in Table 6 apply for the stop-controlled
approaches. The guidelines also state that the criteria do not apply to low volume roadways, though it

does not specify when a roadway would be considered “low volume.”

OTHER INTERSECTION-LEVEL CRITERIA

The City of Belmont Guidelines also states that there would be a significant impact at an intersection if:


    •   The Proposed Project traffic causes the intersection to meet or exceed Caltrans signal warrant

        criteria. For intersections that already exceed signal warrant criteria, Proposed Project traffic

        increases the V/C ratio by 0.01.

    •   The Proposed Project traffic increases volumes to a level meeting or exceeding criteria for

        provision of a right or left-turn lane on an intersection approach. For intersections that already
        exceed turn lane warrant criteria, Proposed Project traffic increases peak hour volume by more

        than 1%.

    •   The Proposed Project creates or adds to an existing unsignalized intersection such that it does not

        have adequate sight lines based upon Caltrans criteria and/or criteria for City intersections.

    •   The Proposed Project traffic creates vehicle queues exceeding turn lane capacity or causes
        problematic back-ups of traffic on driveways or roadways on or off of the Proposed Project site.

        For intersections where this already occurs, Proposed Project traffic increases vehicle queues by

        1%


OTHER SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

In addition to the criteria listed above, the City of Belmont Guidelines defines specific significance criteria

for On-Site Roads and Frontage Improvements, Parking, Emergency Access, Policies and Plans, and Road
Hazards.


On-Site Roads and Frontage Improvements

The guidelines define on-site roads and frontage improvement impacts as significant if the Proposed

Project’s on-site circulation would not meet the City’s minimum standards for roadway or driveway design

or, in the opinion of the registered traffic engineer conducting the study, results in safety hazards to
pedestrians, bicyclists or vehicles.




                                                                                                                13
Transportation Impact Study for Belmont SpringHill Suites Hotel
July 2015




Parking

The guidelines define parking impacts as significant if the Proposed Project’s on-site vehicle or bicycle
parking supply would not be adequate to accommodate demand based upon City code criteria.


Emergency Access

The guidelines define emergency access impacts as significant if the Proposed Project site would have
inadequate emergency access.


Policies and Plans

The guidelines define policy and plan impacts as significant if the Proposed Project would conflict with

adopted policies, plans, or programs.


Road Hazards

The guidelines define road hazard impacts as significant if the Proposed Project would substantially
increase hazards to pedestrians, bicyclists or vehicles due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or
dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses.


FREEWAY SEGMENTS

The City of Belmont Guidelines does not specify formal guidelines for freeway significance criteria.

However, C/CAG’s Congestion Management Program (2013) specifies a LOS standard of E for US-101
within the Proposed Project area. In addition, C/CAG’s Policy on Traffic Impact Analysis (2006) provides the

following guidelines for determining significant traffic impacts on freeway segments:


For freeway segments currently in compliance with the adopted LOS standard:


     •   A Proposed Project is considered to have a CMP impact if the Proposed Project would cause the
         freeway segment to operate at a level of service that violates the standard adopted in the current
         Congestion Management Program (CMP).

     •   A Proposed Project would be considered to have a CMP impact if the cumulative analysis

         indicates that the combination of the Proposed Project and future cumulative traffic demand
         would cause the freeway segment to operate at a level of service that violates the standard

        adopted in the current Congestion Management Program (CMP) and the Proposed Project would
        increase traffic demand on the freeway segment by an amount equal to one (1) percent or more

        of the segment capacity or would causes the freeway segment volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio to
        increase by one (1) percent.


For freeway segments currently not in compliance with the adopted LOS standard:


    •   A Proposed Project would be considered to have a CMP impact if the Proposed Project would add

        traffic demand equal to one (1) percent or more of the segment capacity or cause the freeway
        segment volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio to increase by one (1) percent, if the freeway segment is

        currently not in compliance with the adopted LOS standard.

2.      EXISTING CONDITIONS

This chapter describes the transportation facilities in the Proposed Project study area, including the
surrounding roadway network, as well as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities. Existing intersection and

freeway segment operations are also described.



ROADWAY SYSTEM

The Proposed Project site is located at the intersection of Shoreway Road and Cormorant Drive. The site is

accessible to US-101 via Shoreway Road or Twin Dolphin Drive, both of which connect to the major east-
west roadways Ralston Avenue/Marine Parkway and Holly Street/Redwood Shores Parkway. These

roadways also provide connections to local office and residential areas, as well as to the Belmont and San

Carlos Caltrain Stations. Additional major north-south roadways within the study area include El Camino
Real and Old County Road.


US-101 is located just west of the Proposed Project site and is a major north-south freeway that provides

regional access. The freeway extends southward through San Jose and northward through San Francisco.

Near the Proposed Project site, US-101 provides four travel lanes and an auxiliary lane in the northbound
and southbound directions. Interchanges at Ralston Avenue and Holly Street provide access between US-

101 and the Proposed Project site via Shoreway Road or Twin Dolphin Drive. The posted speed limit on

US-101 is 55 mph. A bicycle/pedestrian bridge crosses US-101 just north of the Ralston Avenue

interchanges, providing access to the Bay Trail multiuse path.


Ralston Avenue is an east-west four-lane arterial roadway with a center median. The posted speed limit
on Ralston Avenue is 30 to 35 mph. Some on-street parking is provided on Ralston Avenue west of the
US-101 interchanges. SamTrans bus routes 60, 67, 260, and 261 operate along Ralston Avenue within the

study area. Ralston Avenue is a designated Class III bicycle route.


Marine Parkway is an east-west six-lane arterial roadway with a center median that begins where Ralston

Avenue ends at the US-101 northbound off-ramp interchange. The posted speed limit on Marine Parkway

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES

PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals. Immediately surrounding the

Proposed Project site, sidewalks are provided on both sides of Cormorant Drive/Shoreline Drive and on
the east side of Shoreway Road. There is no sidewalk on the west side of Shoreway Road or on the private

driveways that run adjacent to the south and east sides of the Proposed Project site. Pedestrian crossings

across Cormorant Drive are striped at Shoreway Road and at the existing driveways on the northeast

corner of the Proposed Project site. At the signalized study intersection Shoreline Drive/Twin Dolphin
Drive to the east of the Proposed Project site, pedestrian signal heads and curb ramps are provided where

crosswalks are striped. A crosswalk is not striped on the west leg of the intersection.


BICYCLE FACILITIES

Bicycle facilities in the study area include the following facility types:


    Bicycle Paths (Class I) – Paved trails that are separated from roadways;

    Bicycle Lanes (Class II) – Lanes on roadways designated for use by bicycles through striping,

    pavement legends, and signs; and

    Bicycle Routes (Class III) – Roadways designated for bicycle use by signs only; may or may not
    include additional pavement width and/or shared-lane markings (“sharrows”) for cyclists.


The Bay Trail is a multi-use Class I bicycle path that runs along Twin Dolphin Drive in the study area. The

Bay Trail is a 340-mile network of walking and bicycling paths around the Bay Area, with a planned
network of over 500 miles of trails. It is a high-quality regional pedestrian and bicycle facility with
convenient access to the Proposed Project site.

service to Belmont via a station located immediately north of Ralston Avenue between El Camino Real and

Old County Road. Only Local and Limited-stop trains serve the Belmont Caltrain Station, with four to five

Limited Trains serving the station in each direction during the morning and afternoon peak periods. For

access to Baby Bullet rail service, Caltrain provides a free shuttle from the Belmont Caltrain Station to the
Hillsdale Caltrain Station, which is served by two to three Baby Bullet trains in each direction during the

morning and afternoon peak periods. The Proposed Project site is an approximately 1.5-mile walk from

EXISTING TURNING MOVEMENT COUNTS

Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak period intersection turning
movement counts were conducted at the study intersections on Thursday, April 16, 2015. The counts

captured vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. At each study intersection, the hour with the highest
volumes, based on 15-minute count totals, was identified as the peak hour for analysis.


The highest AM and PM peak hour vehicle volumes were observed on Ralston Avenue and Holly

Street/Redwood Shores Parkway in the eastbound and westbound directions. Vehicle volumes were also

high along El Camino Real in the northbound and southbound directions during the PM peak hour. Peak
hour vehicle volumes at the ten study intersections are presented in Figure 5, along with existing lane

configurations and traffic control devices (i.e., stop signs and traffic signals). Full traffic count sheets are

provided in Appendix B.


Peak hour bicycle volumes in the study area ranged widely by intersection. Volumes were generally higher
during the AM peak hour than during the PM peak hour, with an average of 21 and 12 bicyclists per

intersection, respectively. AM peak hour counts ranged from one to 46 bicyclists, and PM peak hour

counts ranged from one to 25 bicyclists. The highest bicycle volumes were observed at intersections with

on-street bicycle facilities, such as Redwood Shores Parkway, and at intersections along Twin Dolphin

Drive.


With the exception of the intersection adjacent to the Belmont Caltrain Station, pedestrian volumes in the

study area were generally low. Recent counts observed at most 24 crossings during the AM peak hour and
31 crossings during the PM peak hour. Pedestrian volumes were significantly higher at the entrance to the

Belmont Caltrain Station, where nearly 100 pedestrians crossed per hour during both the AM and PM

peak hours.

EXISTING ROADWAY OPERATIONS

INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE

Existing intersection operations were evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hours using the
methods described in Chapter 1. Intersection analysis was based on the volumes, lane configurations and

traffic controls shown in Figure 5. Observed peak hour factors were used at all intersections for the
                     1
existing analysis.


The results of the intersection levels of service analysis are summarized in Table 8. As shown, all but one
of the study intersections operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak periods. The exception

is the intersection of Ralston Avenue and El Camino Real, which operates at LOS E during both the AM

and PM peak periods.


Detailed intersection LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix C. Field observations were
used to calibrate and confirm the calculated levels of service.

  The relationship between the peak 15-minute flow rate and the full hourly volume is the peak-hour factor (PHF), as defined in the
following equation: PHF=Hourly volume/(4 x volume during the peak 15 minutes of flow). The analysis of level of service is based on
peak rates of flow occurring within the peak 15 minutes of the peak hour, because substantial short-term fluctuations typically occur
during an hour.

SIGNAL WARRANTS

To assess the need for signalization of stop-controlled intersections, the California Manual on Uniform

Traffic Control Devices (California MUTCD) (Caltrans, 2014) presents eight signal warrants. The Peak Hour
Volume Signal Warrant was used in this study as a supplemental analysis tool to assess operations at
                                 2
unsignalized intersections. Based on this analysis, the unsignalized study intersection at Shoreline

 Unsignalized intersection warrant analysis is intended to examine the general correlation between existing conditions and the need
to install new traffic signals. Existing peak-hour volumes are compared against a subset of the standard traffic signal warrants

Drive/Cormorant Drive and the existing driveways at the northeast corner of the Proposed Project site
(Intersection 4) would not meet the Peak Hour Volume Signal Warrant for the Existing AM or PM peak

hours. Peak Hour Volume Signal Warrant worksheets are included in Appendix D.


FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE

Existing weekday AM and PM peak hour operations of the freeway mainline segments on US-101 and
ramp merge and diverge areas were evaluated using the methods described in Chapter 1. As shown in

Table 9, all freeway segments operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak
periods. Therefore, the freeway segments are operating in compliance with the adopted LOS standard set

by the C/CAG Congestion Management Program (LOS E or better for study segments).


Detailed freeway segment LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix E.

recommended in the California MUTCD and associated State guidelines. This analysis should not serve as the only basis for deciding
whether and when to install a signal. To reach such a decision, the full set of warrants should be investigated based on field-
measured traffic data and a thorough study of traffic and roadway conditions by an experienced engineer. Furthermore, the decision
to install a signal should not be based solely on the warrants because the installation of signals can lead to certain types of collisions.
The responsible State or local agency should undertake regular monitoring of actual traffic conditions and collision data and
conduct a timely re-evaluation of the full set of warrants in order to prioritize and program intersections for signalization.

3.         PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS

This chapter provides an overview of the Proposed Project components and addresses the Proposed
Project trip generation, distribution, and assignment characteristics. This allows for an evaluation of

Proposed Project impacts on the surrounding roadway network, which is discussed in the following
chapters. The amount of traffic associated with the Proposed Project was estimated using a three-step

process:


     1) Trip Generation – The amount of vehicle traffic entering/exiting the Proposed Project site was
           estimated.

     2) Trip Distribution – The direction trips would use to approach and depart the site was projected.

     3) Trip Assignment – The specific roadways and intersections trips would use were determined.


PROJECT TRIP GENERATION

Trip generation refers to the process of estimating the amount of vehicular traffic a project would add to

the surrounding roadway system. Estimates are created for the peak one-hour periods during the
morning and evening commute periods when traffic volumes on the adjacent streets are highest. Project

vehicle trip generation is typically estimated using rates that are published in the Institute of

Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition), using common land uses that best match
proposed project land uses.


For this study, the hotel land use category was used (ITE code 310). Information provided by the Project

Sponsor on the proposed number of hotel employees and their shift times allowed for the breakdown of
total trips into employee and guest trips. The Proposed Project would generate an estimated 90 AM peak
hour vehicle trips (53 in and 37 out) and 102 PM peak hour vehicle trips (52 in and 50 out), as shown in
Table 10.

PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

Trip distribution percentages for the Proposed Project were developed based on the location of the

Proposed Project site, the proposed uses for the site, travel routes based on the regional travel demand
model, and previous traffic studies in the area. Overall trip distribution for all trip types to and from the

Proposed Project site was generated as a weighted average of estimated trip distributions by trip type, as

outlined below:


     Hotel employee trip distribution was determined based on likely work trip patterns in the area and
     aligned with percentages presented in previous approved local studies, including the Autobahn
     project.

     Hotel guest check-in and check-out trip distribution was estimated based on the assumption that

     hotel guests would travel long distances to stay at a hotel and, therefore, would access the site from a
     local freeway. This captures guests arriving by car or by plane from their origin location, since trips to
     the Proposed Project site from major local airports would travel via US-101.

     Hotel guest day trip distribution was based on an analysis of the C/CAG 2013 travel demand model,
     which looked at the distribution of trips to/from a residential zone close to the Proposed Project site.

     This approach assumes that day trips of hotel guests would closely align with work trips of people
     living in the area.


Hotel guest trip types were assumed to be split 50/50 between check-in/check-out and day trips, based

on information provided by the Project Sponsor that the anticipated average length of stay would be two

nights. If the average guest stayed at the hotel for two nights, half of the trips every morning and every
evening would be check-in/check-out and half would be a day trip taken between the two nights.


Proposed Project trip distribution percentages were developed in collaboration with City of Belmont staff.

Table 11 summarizes trip distribution for the Proposed Project by type and overall. A detailed analysis of

trip distribution by type is provided in Appendix F.

4.      EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS

This chapter evaluates potential off-site traffic impacts under Existing Plus Project conditions.



EXISTING PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The Proposed Project vehicle turning movement volumes at study intersections were determined based
on the trip generation, trip distribution and trip assignment analysis discussed above. The Proposed

Project vehicle trips (Figure 6) were added to the existing observed peak hour traffic volumes (Figure 5)

to estimate the Existing Plus Project peak hour traffic volumes, as shown in Figure 7.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT ROADWAY OPERATIONS

INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE

Existing Plus Project intersection operations were evaluated based on the methodology and impact
criteria described in Chapter 1. Table 12 summarizes intersection levels of service under Existing and

Existing Plus Project conditions.


The study intersections would continue to operate at the same or similar levels of service with the

addition of Proposed Project traffic. Signalized intersections would continue to operate at LOS D or better

during both peak hours, with the exception of the intersection of Ralston Avenue and El Camino Real,

which would continue to operate at LOS E with an increased delay of approximately two seconds during
the AM peak hour. Therefore, the Proposed Project would result in a less-than-significant impact to

traffic operations at signalized and unsignalized study intersections.


Detailed intersection LOS calculation worksheets are presented in Appendix C.

Notes:
    1.    Signal = signalized intersection, SSS = side-street stop controlled intersection.
    2.    Traffic operations results include delay (seconds per vehicle) and LOS (level of service). LOS is based on delay thresholds
          published in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (Transportation Research Board, 2000). For side-street stop-controlled
          intersections, worst approach delay is shown.
    3. Bold denotes LOS E or LOS F.

SIGNAL WARRANTS

A Peak Hour Volume Signal Warrant analysis was conducted for Existing plus Project conditions at the

unsignalized study intersection at Shoreline Drive/Cormorant Drive and the existing driveways at the
northeast corner of the Proposed Project site (Intersection 4). Based on this analysis, the intersection
would not meet the Peak Hour Volume Signal Warrant for the Existing Plus Project AM or PM peak hours.

Peak Hour Volume Signal Warrant worksheets are included in Appendix D.


FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVEL OF SERVICE

Existing Plus Project freeway operations were evaluated based on the methodology and impact criteria

described in Chapter 1. Table 13 summarizes freeway segment levels of service under Existing and
Existing Plus Project conditions.

All freeway segments would continue to operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during the AM and PM
peak periods with the addition of Proposed Project traffic. Therefore, all freeway segments would

continue to operate in compliance with the adopted LOS standard set by the C/CAG Congestion
Management Program (LOS E or better for study segments), and the Proposed Project would result in a
less-than-significant impact to operations at study freeway segments.

5.      CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

This    chapter      discusses    Cumulative      traffic    conditions       without      and      with      the
Proposed Project. The future traffic conditions analysis considers the build-out of the Proposed Project as

well as other reasonably foreseeable new development and planned roadway improvements in the
surrounding areas.



CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC FORECASTS

The Cumulative scenario presented here represents year 2040 traffic forecasts. The forecasts were based

on growth projected in the C/CAG regional travel demand model run calibrated as part of the Lincoln
Centre Life Sciences Research Campus Project EIR in nearby Foster City. The C/CAG model included land

use changes (consistent with ABAG Projections 2013) and funded regional transportation projects. There

are no major future roadway improvements planned in the vicinity of the Proposed Project; however,

there is a significant amount of land use growth projected in the area.


Year 2040 represents a reasonable Cumulative baseline scenario as a timeline that would likely see all

pending/approved projects (including the Proposed Project) be completed and occupied. A scenario

reflecting conditions before year 2040 may fail to capture all reasonably anticipated growth around the

Proposed Project site, and a scenario beyond the year 2040 may deemphasize the Proposed Project trips
and potential Proposed Project impacts because of the assumption of continued growth in the area.


Raw intersection peak hour turning movement forecasts were developed using the Furness Method,

which is a link-level adjustment procedure that adds the percentage growth projected by the model
between the base year and the future year to the existing turning movement volumes. These results were
refined to produce intersection peak hour forecasts that accounted for volume balancing between

intersections and that were consistent with forecasts from other recently approved studies.


The resulting Cumulative Without Project forecasts, as well as Cumulative lane geometries and traffic

control devices, are presented in Figure 8. The peak hour Proposed Project volumes (Figure 6) were




                                                                                                               43

added to the Cumulative Without Project traffic volumes to determine Cumulative Plus Project traffic
volumes, as presented in Figure 9.


Freeway mainline and ramp forecasts were developed from the forecasts for the US-101/Holly Street
Interchange Project Approval and Environmental Document. That project utilized the C/CAG regional
travel demand models for 2010 and 2035 to develop Year 2038 forecasts. The Year 2038 forecasts were

linearly extrapolated two years to develop Year 2040 mainline and ramp forecasts.
