Executive Summary

This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared for the proposed
office development located at 401-409 Alberto Way in Los Gatos, CA. The project site is located on the
northwest corner of the intersection of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road (State Route 9) and Alberto Way.
Existing uses on the project site consist of 30,000 square feet of office buildings. The project would
demolish the existing buildings and replace them with a 93,500 1square foot office complex. Access to the
project site would be provided via two driveways located on Alberto Way.
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the Town of Los Gatos and the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA) Congestion Management Plan (CMP). The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM peak hour
levels of service for five (5) signalized intersections two (2) freeway segments, and four (4) freeway ramps
at the interchange of SR 17 and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Two of the study intersections are CMP
intersections.
Per CMP technical guidelines, a freeway segment level of service analysis is required when a project
would add trips greater than one percent of a segment’s capacity. Although the proposed project would
add trips greater than one percent of capacity on southbound SR 17 from Lark Avenue to Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road during the AM peak hour, this freeway segment is currently operating at an acceptable
LOS D during the AM peak hour. The increase in segment trips would not significantly impact the freeway
LOS. Project impacts on other transportation categories, such as vehicle queuing, pedestrian, bicycle and
transit facilities, site access and on-site circulation, were determined on the basis of engineering
judgment.

Project Trip Generation
Daily and peak-hour trip generation estimates for the proposed project are based on trip rates published
in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition for a general office building. The proposed new buildings
are expected to generate 181 trips (159 in and 22 out) during the AM peak hour and 183 trips (31 in and
152 out) during the PM peak hour.
The existing buildings on the site are partially occupied and are generating traffic. Therefore, the traffic
generated by the project will not be entirely new trips. Hexagon counted the site driveways to determine
the number of trips currently being generated. The current trip generation is 42 trips during the AM peak
hour and 81 trips during the PM peak hour. The difference between the project trips and the existing trips
were added to the road network. This equates to 139 net new trips during the AM peak hour and 102 net
new trips during the PM peak hour.

  Since the initiation of the traffic study, the project size has been slightly reduced to 92,800 square feet. This report
analyzes the project assuming its original size of 93,500 square feet. Thus, the study slightly overstates the added
traffic due to the project.


                                                                                                        iii | Page

Intersection Levels of Service
The intersection level of service analysis concluded that all study intersections would operate at
acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) under all study scenarios. Therefore, the proposed project
would have an insignificant impact on intersection levels of service.
Intersection levels of service results are summarized in Table ES-1.

Operations Analysis
Operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts. Therefore, they are included for informational
purposes.
In order to accommodate left turn queues with the project, Hexagon recommends extending the
eastbound left-turn pocket on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road to 250 feet. The existing 150 foot left-turn
storage space would be insufficient to contain the queue with the project. With the proposed improvement
to extend the eastbound left-turn lane to 250 feet, the 95th percentile queue during both the AM and PM
peak hours would be sufficiently contained within the turn pocket. The applicant has agreed to make this
improvement. Based on community input, Hexagon also recommends restriping the southbound leg of
Alberto Way to include a right-turn lane and a shared left-through lane. Although not required to mitigate
project impacts, the applicant has agreed to make this improvement. A dedicated right-turn lane would
allow right-turn vehicles to bypass left-turn vehicles and turn onto westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
when Alberto Way has the red light and there are sufficient gaps to perform the turn.
The driveway on the east side of Alberto Way for the Best Western Inn is located approximately 125 feet
north of the intersection. The queuing analysis shows that during the PM peak hour under all but the
existing conditions, the 95th percentile queue on the southbound right-turn lane on Alberto Way (between
150 and 200 feet) would block vehicles at the Best Western driveway from turning into the right-turn lane.
The 95th percentile queue in the southbound shared left-through lane on Alberto Way would not block the
Best Western driveway. The 95th percentile queue during the PM peak hour in the southbound right-turn
lane on Alberto Way would comprise eight vehicles. It is expected that the existing signal at the Alberto
Way intersection would be able to clear all vehicles within each cycle. Right-turn vehicles on Alberto Way
also will be able to turn onto westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road when there are sufficient gaps in
westbound traffic on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Therefore, it is expected that vehicles at the Best
Western driveway would be able to turn onto Alberto Way with minimal delays.

Recommendations
Although not related to project impacts, Hexagon recommends that the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road at Alberto Way be upgraded, as well as interconnected to the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
at Los Gatos Boulevard. These improvements would improve vehicle progression on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road, which would help left-turn vehicles turning onto Alberto Way maneuver out of the eastbound
through lanes on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road and into the left-turn lane. This would improve the eastbound
left-turn green phase utilization on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, and reduce the potential for left-turn
vehicles having to wait extra cycles to be able to clear the intersection and lengthening the left-turn
queue. The project applicant has agreed to make these improvements.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
The project site is not connected to nearby bicycle facilities. Access to the project site via Los Gatos
Boulevard would require bikers to share the road with vehicles for 800 feet on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road,
which would be adequate for experienced cyclists. The lack of bicycle facilities leading to the site means
that inexperienced cyclists would not be encouraged to ride to the project. The Town’s planned Complete
Streets project on Los-Gatos-Saratoga Road (Highway 9) could improve conditions for cyclists. The
project would be required to contribute to this project via the Town’s traffic impact fee.
At the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, the project voluntarily proposes to
restripe the southbound leg of Alberto Way to include a right-turn lane and a shared left-through lane. The
stop-bar for the shared left-through lane would be set back for a bike box. The voluntarily proposed bike
box would increase bicyclist visibility for drivers and enhance bicyclist safety crossing the intersection.
The conceptual drawings for the proposed off-site improvements are shown on Figure 14 in Chapter 4.
Pedestrian activity could occur between the site and downtown Los Gatos, located approximately ½ mile
west, and the closest bus stops, located ½ mile to the west and ¼ mile to the east. While adequate, the
pedestrian facilities could be improved. There are no sidewalks or crosswalks on the south side of Los
Gatos-Saratoga Road through the SR 17 interchange, only on the north side. The project would be
required to pay a transportation impact fee, which could be used to upgrade the pedestrian facilities in the
area.
As shown on Figure 12 in Chapter 4, the project applicant voluntarily proposes to provide detached
sidewalks with a landscape buffer on Alberto Way along the project site frontage, as well as on the north
side of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road between Alberto Way and the SR 17 northbound on-ramp. Detached
sidewalks with a landscape buffer would provide a wider buffer area between pedestrians and on-street
vehicles.
There is no transit service on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road in front of the site. The closest service is about ¼
mile east on Los Gatos Boulevard or ½ mile west at N. Santa Cruz Avenue. Sidewalks are present to
facilitate pedestrian movements between the project site and these transit stops.

Recommendations
While not required to improve Level of Service or to mitigate impacts related to traffic, it is recommended
that the proposed project implement the voluntary improvements to provide the bike box on Alberto Way
at the intersection with Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, as well as the detached sidewalks with a landscape
buffer on Alberto Way along the project site frontage, and on the north side of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
between Alberto Way and the SR 17 northbound on-ramp.

Site Access and Circulation
Site Access
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveways with regard to corner sight
distance and traffic volumes. The proposed project would have one full-access driveway and one exit-
only driveway on Alberto Way. The northern full-access driveway would provide access to a 7-space
surface parking lot as well as the two-level below-grade parking garage. The 7-space surface parking lot
would have a one-way semicircular drive aisle, connecting to the southern exit-only driveway. Queuing
analysis has indicated that neither driveway would be blocked by the southbound queue at the
intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Therefore, access to the project driveways
would be adequate under all analyzed scenarios.
Corner Sight Distance
Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on Alberto Way is
25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 150 feet. The site plan
shows no tall landscaping or signs near either driveway that would block a driver’s view. Sight distance
for the southern driveway would be adequate. Alberto Way is slightly curved at the two driveway
locations, but the curves do not block a driver’s view 150 feet down the road. No tall landscaping or signs
exist near the driveways that would obstruct a driver’s view. On-street parking is currently permitted
between the two driveways. The parked vehicles block a driver’s view at the south exit-only driveway,
thereby obstructing visibility of southbound vehicles on Alberto Way, and block a driver’s view of
northbound vehicles at the north full-access driveway.

Recommendations
Parking on southbound Alberto Way between the two driveways should be prohibited to ensure adequate
sight distance.

On-Site Circulation
All driveway and drive-aisle widths are at least 24 feet wide, and comply with the minimum requirements
established in the Town of Los Gatos Code of Ordinances Section 29.10.155. All parking stalls within the
parking garage are 18 feet in length (16 feet with 2 feet overhang) and 8 feet 6 inches in width, which
meet the town’s requirements.

Emergency Vehicles, Truck Access and Circulation
The site plan shows that the trash pick-up area is at the northern driveway just before the ramps.
Garbage trucks would exit using the south exit-only driveway via the semi-circular surface drive-aisle. All
driveways and drive-aisles are at least 24 feet wide, which are adequate for emergency vehicle access
and circulation.

Parking
For office use at the project site, the Town of Los Gatos Municipal Code Section 29.10.145 requires
parking to be provided at the rate of 1 parking space per 250 square feet of gross floor area. The project
proposes two office buildings totaling 92,800 square feet, which by code would be required to provide 372
parking spaces. The project site plan provides 395 parking spaces. Parking provision as shown on the
current project site plans would meet the Town standards.
Per the California Building Code (CBC) Table 11B-6, eight (8) accessible spaces are required for parking
garages with 301 to 400 parking spaces. Of the required accessible parking spaces, one van accessible
space is required. As shown on the site plan, the project would provide eight (8) accessible parking
spaces, of which two (2) are accessed via the southern driveway, and the remaining six (6) are located in
the upper level of the below-grade garage near the elevators. The project site plan does not label which
one of the eight (8) parking spaces is van accessible.
The proposed restriping of Alberto Way would eliminate on-street parking spaces on Alberto Way along
the Best Western frontage. Hexagon also has recommended to prohibit parking on Alberto Way along the
project building frontage for sight distance issues exiting the project site. There is approximately 70 feet of
on-street parking along the Best Western frontage, and approximately 130 feet of on-street parking along
the project frontage. Combined, the proposed project would eliminate approximately eight vehicle-spaces
of on-street parking on Alberto Way. The five parking spaces along the project frontage could be
accommodated by the project parking garage. The removed parking spaces along the Best Western
frontage are assumed to be accommodated by its own parking facility.

Recommendations
The project is recommended to identify the van accessible parking space within the eight accessible
parking spaces. Hexagon recommends the project prohibit parking on Alberto Way along the project
frontage to enhance sight distance for exiting vehicles.

Introduction

This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared for the proposed
office development located at 401-409 Alberto Way in Los Gatos, CA. The project site is located on the
northwest corner of the intersection of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road (State Route 9) and Alberto Way.
Existing uses on the project site consist of 30,000 square feet of office buildings. Portions of the buildings
are being used as medical offices. The project would demolish the existing buildings and replace them
with a 93,500 2square foot office complex. Access to the project site would be provided via two driveways
located on Alberto Way.
Figure 1 shows the study area and project site location. Figure 2 shows the proposed site plan.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the Town of Los Gatos and the Santa Clara County Congestion Management
Program (CMP). The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM peak hour levels of service for five (5)
signalized intersections, two (2) freeway segments, and four (4) freeway ramps at the interchange of SR
17 and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Two of the study intersections are CMP intersections.

  Since the initiation of the traffic study, the project size has been slightly reduced to 92,800 square feet. This report
analyzes the project assuming its original size of 93,500 square feet. Thus, the study slightly overstates the added
traffic due to the project.

                                                                                                          1 | Page

   4. Southbound off-ramp to eastbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of
adjacent street traffic. The AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM,
and the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these
periods on an average weekday that the most congested traffic conditions occur.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
   Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were based on new traffic counts
                  conducted in the year 2015, while schools were in session, the 2014 CMP count data,
                  and previous studies.
   Scenario 2:    Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                  existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
                  developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet completed developments
                  was provided by the Town of Los Gatos.
   Scenario 3:    Background plus Project Conditions. Background traffic volumes with the project were
                  estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the traffic generated by the
                  proposed project less the trips generated by the existing uses. Background plus project
                  conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine
                  potential project impacts.
   Scenario 4:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing traffic volumes with the project were
                  estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the traffic generated by the proposed
                  project less the trips generated by the existing uses. Existing plus Project conditions
                  were evaluated relative to existing conditions in order to determine the effects the
                  project would have on the existing roadway network.
   Scenario 5:    Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative conditions include traffic growth projected to occur
                  due to the approved development projects and other proposed but not yet approved
                  (pending) development projects. The added traffic from pending development projects
                  was provided by the Town of Los Gatos.

   Scenario 6:    Cumulative plus Project Conditions. Cumulative plus project traffic volumes were
                  estimated by adding to cumulative traffic volumes the trips associated with the
                  proposed project less the trips generated by the existing uses. Cumulative plus project
                  conditions were evaluated relative to cumulative conditions in order to determine
                  potential project impacts.

Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, the Town of Los Gatos, VTA’s
CMP database, and field observations. The following data were collected from these sources:

   existing traffic volumes,
   approved and pending project trips,
   intersection lane configurations, and
   signal timing and phasing.

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are
described below.
Town of Los Gatos Intersections
The Town of Los Gatos level of service methodology for signalized intersections is the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) method. This method is applied using the TRAFFIX software. The 2000 HCM
operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time
for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersection level of service
methodology, the Town of Los Gatos methodology employs the CMP default values for the analysis
parameters. The Town of Los Gatos level of service standard for all signalized intersections is LOS D or
better. The correlation between average control delay and level of service for signalized intersections is
shown in Table 1.
CMP Intersections
The designated level of service methodology for the CMP also is the 2000 HCM operations method for
signalized intersections, using TRAFFIX. The only difference in level of service standards is that in the
Town of Los Gatos the standard is LOS D or better, and the CMP level of service standard for signalized
intersections is LOS E or better. However, CMP intersections within the Town of Los Gatos are evaluated
according to Town of Los Gatos standards.
Freeway Segments
Per CMP technical guidelines, a freeway segment level of service analysis is required when a project
would add trips greater than one percent of a segment’s capacity. Although the proposed project would
add trips greater than one percent of capacity on southbound SR 17 from Lark Avenue to Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road during the AM peak hour, this freeway segment is currently operating at an acceptable
LOS D during the AM peak hour. The increase in segment trips would not significantly impact the freeway
LOS. A simple freeway segment capacity evaluation to substantiate this determination is presented in
Table 2.
Freeway Ramps
A freeway ramp analysis was performed in order to verify that the freeway ramps would have sufficient
capacity to serve the expected traffic volumes with and without the project. This analysis consisted of a
volume-to-capacity ratio evaluation of the freeway ramps at the study interchange. The ramp capacities
were obtained from the Highway Capacity Manual 2000, and considered the free-flow speed and number
of lanes on the ramp. The study ramps are currently not metered during either the AM or PM peak hours.

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the green
     A      phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to the very                               10.0 or less
            low vehicle delay.

            delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
    C                                                                                                                        20.1 to 35.0
            of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the intersection
            without stopping.
            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
            result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle

            lengths, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
            individual cycle failures are noticeable.

            This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
     E      generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-                                 55.1 to 80.0
            to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
     F                                                                                                                    greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also
            be major-contributing causes of such delay levels.

2.
Existing Conditions

This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the project site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Also
included are the existing levels of service of the study intersections.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided by SR 17. Local access to the project site is provided via
Los Gatos-Saratoga Road (SR 9), N. Santa Cruz Avenue, University Avenue, Alberto Way, Los Gatos
Boulevard and Caldwell Avenue. These facilities are described below.
SR 17 is a four-lane freeway in the vicinity of the study area. It extends south to Santa Cruz and north to
I-280 in San Jose, at which point it makes a transition into I-880, which extends to Oakland. Access to the
project site is provided via SR 17’s interchange with Los Gatos-Saratoga Road (SR 9). The SR 17
northbound on-ramp from westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road forms the western boundary of the
project site.
Los Gatos-Saratoga Road (SR 9) is a four lane arterial roadway adjacent to the project site. It extends
from Los Gatos Boulevard in a northwesterly direction. At the town boundary of Los Gatos and Monte
Sereno, it changes name to Saratoga-Los Gatos Road. Saratoga-Los Gatos Road transitions to
Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road at the intersection of Big Basin Way (which is the continuation of SR 9) and
Saratoga Avenue. Los Gatos-Saratoga Road has a median that begins east of the SR 17 interchange
and continues to Massol Avenue. Los Gatos-Saratoga Road forms the southern boundary of the project
site.
N. Santa Cruz Avenue is a two-lane roadway that runs in a north-south direction and serves as the
primary commercial street in downtown Los Gatos. Santa Cruz Avenue extends from SR 17 in the south
to Blossom Hill Road, where it transitions to Winchester Boulevard, which continues north as a four-lane
arterial through Los Gatos, Campbell, and San Jose to its terminus in Santa Clara. Within the Los Gatos
central business district, N. Santa Cruz Avenue has two lanes and on-street parking.
University Avenue is a two-lane roadway that runs parallel to N. Santa Cruz Avenue. It extends from
Main Street to Lark Avenue.
Alberto Way is a two-lane roadway that runs parallel to SR 17. It extends from Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
northward approximately 2,000 feet to a dead-end. Alberto Way forms the eastern boundary of the project
site, and provides direct access to the project site.
Los Gatos Boulevard is a four to six-lane north-south arterial that extends from SR 85 south to Main
Street. North of SR 85 and south of Loma Alta Avenue, Los Gatos Boulevard changes designation to
Bascom Avenue and Main Street, respectively. Los Gatos Boulevard has four lanes between SR 85 and
Lark Avenue, then widens to six lanes between Lark Avenue and Blossom Hill Road. Within the project
vicinity, the roadway is two-lanes wide.
Caldwell Avenue/Kennedy Road is a two-lane residential roadway that begins at Los Gatos Boulevard
and runs west to Bella-Vista Avenue. Kennedy Road begins at Los Gatos Boulevard and runs east
through the hills to Shannon Road. Kennedy Road is a two-lane residential street. Caldwell Avenue and
Kennedy Road form a somewhat offset intersection with Los Gatos Boulevard that is signalized.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
A Class I bicycle trail, the Los Gatos Creek Trail, is located near the project site, running in a north-south
direction just west of Highway 17. A Class II bikeway (defined as a striped bike lane on the street) is
present on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, extending westward from just east of the University Avenue
intersection. A Class II bikeway is present on eastbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road between the Bella
Vista Avenue overpass and Los Gatos Boulevard. Bike lanes are also present on Los Gatos Boulevard
within the project vicinity. Although none of the residential streets near the project site is designated as
bike routes, due to their low traffic volumes, many of them are conducive to bicycle usage. Existing
bicycle facilities are shown on Figure 3.
Pedestrian facilities consist mostly of sidewalks along both the commercial and residential streets in the
vicinity of the project site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are located at all of
the signalized intersections in the study area, except on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road at the intersections
with Alberto Way and with Los Gatos Boulevard. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push
buttons are present only on the north and east legs of the Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
intersection, and on the west and south legs of the Los Gatos Boulevard and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
intersection. Sidewalks are on both sides of all roadways within the project vicinity, except Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road between University Avenue and Los Gatos Boulevard does not have a sidewalk on the
south side of the street.

Existing Transit Services
Existing transit service to the project site is provided by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). VTA provides bus service near the project area via Routes 48 and 49. Existing transit services are
shown on Figure 4.
Local Route 48 operates on N. Santa Cruz Avenue, University Avenue, and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road in
the study area. It runs from the Los Gatos Civic Center to the Winchester Transit Center in Campbell with
30-minute headways in the AM and PM peak hours. Route 48 operates between 6:30 AM and 8:30 PM.
The closest Route 48 bus stop to the project site is located on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road west of
University Avenue, approximately ½ mile west of the project site.
Local Route 49 operates on Los Gatos Boulevard in the study area. It runs from the Los Gatos Civic
Center to the Winchester Transit Center in Campbell with 30-minute headways in the AM and PM peak
hours. Route 49 operates between 6:30 AM and 8:40 PM. The closest bus stop is near Caldwell Avenue,
about ¼ mile from the project site.
The Winchester Transit Center, the northern terminus of Route 48 and 49, is a station for VTA’s light rail
transit (LRT) service. The LRT line that terminates at the Winchester Transit Center provides service to
downtown Mountain View, via downtown San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were confirmed by observations in the field and
are shown on Figure 5. Recent improvements at the intersection of University Avenue and Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road include the addition of a second left turn lane on the southbound approach and a
separate right turn lane on the northbound approach. These improvements, plus the changes made in
signal controls and phasing so that all left turns are protected, have been incorporated into the TRAFFIX
analysis for this intersection.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new traffic counts conducted in January and May 2015, and
the 2014 VTA’s CMP TRAFFIX database. The existing traffic volumes at the study intersections include
the traffic being generated by the existing buildings on the site.
The existing AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes are shown graphically on Figure 6. The traffic
count data are included in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis show that, measured against the Town of Los
Gatos and CMP level of service standards, all of the signalized study intersections currently operate at an
acceptable level of service (LOS D) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The results of the
intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 3.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Existing Freeway Ramp Capacity Analysis
This analysis consisted of a volume-to-capacity ratio evaluation of four freeway ramps at the interchange
of SR 17 and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. The ramp capacities were obtained from the Highway Capacity
Manual 2000, which considers both the free-flow speed and the number of lanes on the study ramps.
During both the AM and PM peak hours, all ramps are currently not metered. The peak-hour freeway
ramp volumes were obtained from personal communication with Caltrans staff (Jordan Chan) on
September 17, 2015. Table 4 shows the peak hour ramp volumes.
The ramp analysis showed that all freeway ramps currently have sufficient capacity to serve the existing
traffic volumes. All study ramps have a volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio that is well below 1.0, which means
that the existing traffic demand is far lower than the ramp capacity.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions were observed in the field to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic
problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the
level of service analysis does not accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.

Los Gatos-Saratoga Road at N. Santa Cruz Avenue and University Avenue
At the Town’s request, Hexagon performed field observations at the intersections on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road at N. Santa Cruz Avenue and at University Avenue on a regular weekday during the AM and PM
peak hours once before the summer break in May, and once after the summer break in November. In
general, congestion in the AM peak hour is observed in the westbound direction on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road from the SR 17 ramps to west past Santa Cruz Avenue. The congestion is mainly caused by the
two lanes into one lane merging point on westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road west of N. Santa Cruz
Avenue. Vehicles typically require two signal cycles to clear the N. Santa Cruz Avenue and University
Avenue intersections. The eastbound left-turn vehicles on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road turning onto N.
Santa Cruz Avenue also required two signal cycles to clear. Because of queuing issues on westbound
Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, congestion is also observed on N. Santa Cruz Avenue and University Avenue
in both directions. Queues on these side streets extend to the upstream intersections and require more
than two signal cycles to clear. Northbound left-turn vehicles out of N. Santa Cruz Avenue and University
Avenue are also observed blocking the intersection to avoid waiting an additional cycle.




                                                                                                           15 | Page
401-409 Alberto Way – Final Transportation Impact Analysis                               August 2, 2016


During the PM peak hour, congestion is observed in the eastbound direction on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road from west of Ridgecrest Avenue to University Avenue. Vehicles typically require more than two
signal cycles to clear the N. Santa Cruz Avenue and University Avenue intersections. The westbound left-
turn vehicles on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road turning onto University Avenue required two signal cycles to
clear. Because of the queuing issue on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, there are instances when the
southbound left-turn movements on University Avenue and on N. Santa Cruz Avenue getting onto
eastbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road also experienced lengthy delays. Other movements on University
Avenue and on N. Santa Cruz Avenue are able to clear the intersection within one signal cycle.

Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
During the AM peak period, heavy traffic volume was observed only on the eastbound leg of Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road. There was spillback from the downstream intersection on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road at
Los Gatos Boulevard. As a result, the inner eastbound through lane on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road queues
to the SR 17 southbound on-ramp, and the outer eastbound through lane on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
queues onto the SR 17 northbound off-ramp. Because of the spillback issue from Los Gatos Boulevard,
the eastbound through movement on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road requires several signal cycles to clear
the queue.
During the PM peak period, the westbound through movement on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road receives
moderate queues that extend toward the location of the Bella Vista Avenue overpass, but all clear within
one signal cycle. No other operational issues were observed.

Los Gatos Boulevard and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
During the AM peak period, heavy traffic volume was observed on the eastbound leg of Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road. The eastbound left-turn lane on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road feeds onto northbound Los
Gatos Boulevard, but because of spillback issues at the downstream intersection at Caldwell Avenue, the
eastbound left-turn lane on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road requires 3 cycles to clear. The right-turn lane on
Los Gatos-Saratoga Road is queued only to the location of the Bella Vista Avenue overpass, and clears
within one signal cycle. No significant issues were observed on other movements.
During the PM peak period, heavy traffic volumes were observed on the southbound through movement
on Los Gatos Boulevard and eastbound left-turn movement on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Both
movements required two signal cycles to clear. No other operational issues were observed.

Los Gatos Boulevard and Caldwell Avenue/Kennedy Road
During the AM peak period, a crossing guard is present on the west and south crosswalks. There are
heavy pedestrian (school children) movements on the west and south crosswalks. The northbound
through movement on Los Gatos Boulevard constantly queues towards Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, and
causes significant delays on the eastbound movement on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. The southbound
through movement on Los Gatos Boulevard constantly queues towards Nino Avenue, but all vehicles
clear within one signal cycle. The westbound left-turn movement on Kennedy Road is consistently
queued and requires two to three cycles to clear. Right turns on red are prohibited for the northbound,
eastbound, and westbound movements, but few vehicles obeyed the signs. There were no significant
issues observed during the PM peak period.
This study recognizes that during both the AM and PM peak period, several study intersections have
specific movements that require multiple cycles to clear. However, vehicles on other movements at these
intersections do not experience delays longer than one signal cycle. The level of service definition and
methodology represents an average of all movements at an intersection. Thus, if one movement is
congested, but the other movements do not experience lengthy delays, the average level of service can
be acceptable.

Existing Traffic Conditions on Alberto Way
Alberto Way is an approximately 34-foot wide road that dead-ends to the north. There are five on-street
parking spaces along the project frontage and another three spaces across the street in front of the Best
Western hotel.
Hexagon conducted intersection counts at the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos Saratoga Road
in May 2015. Alberto Way carried 65 inbound trips and 79 outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and
83 inbound trips and 103 outbound trips during the PM peak hour. The existing buildings on the study
project site generated 29 inbound and 13 outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 34 inbound and
47 outbound trips during the PM peak hour, which represents approximately 30% of all traffic during the
AM peak hour, and 45% of all traffic during the PM peak hour on Alberto Way. Existing peak hour traffic
volume on Alberto Way is relatively low, with an average of one to two vehicles on the road per minute.
After the initial 500 feet of the road, where all traffic associated with the study project site have turned off
the road, peak hour traffic volume on Alberto Way is reduced to approximately one vehicle per minute.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed project. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise volumes from
existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in the vicinity of the site.
This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes and the resulting
traffic conditions. The background scenario predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as
approved development projects are built and occupied.

Background Transportation Network
It was assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would be the
same as the existing network.

Background Traffic Volumes
Approved developments are those developments that have been approved by local agencies, are under
construction, or are built but not yet occupied. The approved project list was obtained from the Town of
Los Gatos and is included in Appendix B. Based on a review of traffic studies prepared for these projects,
a recent TRAFFIX file provided by the Town of Los Gatos, the types and sizes of these developments,
and their distances from the project site, the following approved developments are expected to add traffic
to at least one of the study intersections during at least one of the peak hour periods:
    1.    Albright Way: Replace 250,000 s.f. of office with 485,000 s.f. of office
    2.    Bentley Silicon Valley Auto Dealer: expansion from 26,085 s.f. to 31,909 s.f.
    3.    550 Hubbell Way: 4 single-family homes
    4.    375 Knowles Drive: 33 single-family homes
    5.    16005 Los Gatos Blvd: Demolish auto dealer and construct residential/commercial mixed-use
    6.    55 Los Gatos-Saratoga Road: Demolish 3 hotel rooms and add commercial mixed-use
    7.    Placer Oaks Road: 9-unit residential subdivision
    8.    2585 Samaritan Drive (Stanford Cancer Center): Construct 74,800 s.f. additional medical office
    9.    Highlands of Los Gatos: Residential subdivision
    10.   135 Riviera Drive: 50 additional units at Riviera Terrace Apartments
    11.   Lunardi’s Supermarket: 6,204 s.f. expansion
    12.   North 40 Specific Plan: 270 residential units, 250,000 s.f. office/hotel, and 400,000 s.f. of retail
Background peak hour traffic volumes were calculated by adding to existing volumes the estimated traffic
from the approved developments. Vehicle trips from each of the approved projects were obtained from
the TRAFFIX file provided by the Town of Los Gatos or from the project’s traffic impact study. The
estimated trips were assigned to the study intersections according to the distributions and assignments
identified in the Town’s TRAFFIX file or the relevant traffic studies.
Background traffic volumes are shown graphically on Figure 7.

Intersection Levels of Service under Background Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are shown in Table
5. The results show that, measured against the Town of Los Gatos and CMP level of service standards,
all of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D) during both the AM
and PM peak hours of traffic under background conditions.

Project Conditions
This chapter describes the roadway traffic operations under existing plus project conditions and
background plus project conditions, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts
caused by the project. The background plus project scenario is analyzed according to the VTA’s CMP
guidelines. The existing plus project scenario is presented for information purposes only. Existing plus
project traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were to be occupied prior to the other
approved projects in the area. However, it is unlikely that this traffic condition would occur, since some of
the other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely be built and occupied
during the time this project is going through the development review process.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. Impacts on intersections are based
on the significance criteria and level of service standards of the jurisdiction in which the intersection is
located. For this analysis, significance criteria for impacts on intersections are based on the Town of Los
Gatos level of service standard. As noted above, LOS D is an acceptable level of traffic operation at
signalized intersections in Los Gatos.
A project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at an intersection if, for either
peak hour, either of the following conditions occurs:
    1. The addition of project traffic causes an intersection operating at LOS A, B, or C under no-project
       conditions to degrade more than one letter grade under with-project conditions, or
    2. The level of service at an intersection is LOS D or worse under no-project conditions and the
       addition of project traffic causes a degradation of level of service to LOS E or F.
The project shall mitigate any intersection project impact so that the level of service will remain at an
acceptable level (LOS D).
As noted above, the CMP standard for an acceptable level of service is LOS E or better. The CMP
definition of a significant impact states that a project is said to create significant adverse impact on traffic
conditions at a CMP-designated signalized intersection if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions, or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS F under background conditions
       and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the intersection to
       increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by one
       percent (.01) or more.




                                                                                                21 | Page
401-409 Alberto Way – Final Transportation Impact Analysis                                                          August 2, 2016


An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average delay
for critical movements (i.e., the change in average delay for critical movements is negative). In this case,
the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

Project Description
The project site is located at 401-409 Alberto Way in Los Gatos, CA, on the northwest corner of the
intersection of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road (State Route 9) and Alberto Way. Existing uses on the project
site consist of 30,000 square feet of office buildings. A portion of the buildings is occupied for medical
office uses. The project would demolish the existing buildings and replace them with a 93,500 square foot
office complex. Access to the project site would be provided via two driveways located on Alberto Way.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures are described below.

Trip Generation
Daily and peak-hour trip generation estimates for the proposed project are based on trip rates published
in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition for a general office building. The proposed new buildings
are expected to generate 181 trips (159 in and 22 out) during the AM peak hour and 183 trips (31 in and
152 out) during the PM peak hour.
The existing buildings on the site are partially occupied and are generating traffic. Therefore, the traffic
generated by the project will not be entirely new trips. Hexagon counted the site driveways to determine
the number of trips currently being generated. The current trip generation is 42 trips during the AM peak
hour and 81 trips during the PM peak hour. The difference between the project trips and the existing trips
were added to the road network under both background plus project and existing plus project conditions.
This equates to 139 net new trips during the AM peak hour and 102 net new trips during the PM peak
hour. The trip generation estimates are shown on Table 6.

The buildings at the project site are currently partially occupied. The buildings have been fully occupied in
the past. Therefore, project trip generation could also credit the trips generated by the project site
assuming full occupancy. Using the ITE trip rates, the existing buildings on the project site at the entitled
full occupancy are estimated to generate 47 trips (41 in and 6 out) during the AM peak hour and 45 trips
(8 in and 37 out) during the PM peak hour. The net increase in project trips would be 134 trips during the
AM peak hour and 138 trips during the PM peak hour. Trip generation assuming full occupancy is shown
on Table 7. These estimates are shown for informational purposes only. The traffic study is based on
crediting the existing driveway counts.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed project was estimated based on existing travel patterns on
the surrounding roadway system, and the locations of complementary land uses. The project trip
distribution pattern is shown on Figure 8.
The project trips were assigned to the roadway network based on the directions of approach and
departure, the roadway network connections, and the location of project driveways.
Figure 9 presents the net project trips at each study intersection.

Intersection Traffic Volumes
Project impacts were evaluated relative to both (1) background traffic volumes and (2) existing traffic
volumes. For the background plus project scenario, the net new trips generated by the project were
added to the background traffic volumes (described in Chapter 3) to derive the background plus project
traffic volumes. Figure 10 shows the intersection turning-movement volumes under background plus
project conditions. For the existing plus project scenario, the net new trips generated by the project were
added to the existing traffic volumes (described in Chapter 2) to derive the existing plus project traffic
volumes. Figure 11 shows the intersection turning-movement volumes under existing plus project
conditions.

Transportation Network
This analysis assumes that the transportation network under project conditions would be the same as
under existing and background conditions, except at the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road, where the project proposes restriping Alberto Way to include a dedicated right-turn lane
and a shared left-through lane. Parking spaces on Alberto Way along the Best Western Inn frontage
would be removed under the proposed restriping of Alberto Way. Detached sidewalks with a landscape
buffer would be provided on Alberto Way along the project frontage, as well as on the north side of Los
Gatos-Saratoga Road between Alberto Way and SR 17. The project also proposes off-site improvements
to the eastbound left-turn lane on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road at Alberto Way, upgrading the signal at this
intersection, as well as interconnecting this signal to the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road at Los Gatos
Boulevard. At the time of this report, improvement options are being considered. The proposed
intersection off-site improvements at Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road are shown on Figure 12.

Background plus Project Conditions Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus project conditions show
that, measured against the Town of Los Gatos and CMP level of service standards, all of the signalized
study intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D) during both the AM and PM
peak hours of traffic (see Table 8) under background plus project conditions.
At the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, the level of service presented in Table
8 assumes the proposed improvement to restripe Alberto Way to include a dedicated right-turn lane and a
shared left-through lane. When analyzed without the proposed improvement on Alberto Way, this
intersection would continue to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours with minimal
changes to critical delay and critical V/C.
As discussed in Chapter 2, field observations indicate that the intersections on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
at Santa Cruz Avenue and at University Avenue experience longer queues and delays on certain
movements than the LOS calculations indicate. This is because the LOS is an average of all movements,
some of which operate acceptably. The added project traffic at these two intersections would not cause
significant intersection impacts because the increase in critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio would be
less than 0.01 and the increase the average critical movement delay would be less than 4 seconds. The
traffic added at these intersections would also be going in the off-peak direction.
The Town of Los Gatos has also identified intersection improvements at these two intersections that
would be funded by the Town’s Traffic Impact Fee.
Therefore, none of the intersections would be significantly impacted by the project.

Existing Plus Project Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are
summarized in Table 9. The results of the analysis show that all study intersections would continue to
operate at acceptable levels (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours under existing plus
project conditions.
At the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, the level of service presented in Table
9 assumes the proposed improvement to restripe Alberto Way to include a dedicated right-turn lane and a

Project Conditions Freeway Ramp Analysis
Freeway ramp volumes under existing plus project conditions were estimated by adding project trips to
the existing volumes obtained from Caltrans. Table 10 shows the peak hour ramp volumes under existing
plus project conditions.
The ramp analysis under existing plus project conditions shows that the selected ramps would continue to
have sufficient capacity to serve the projected traffic volumes under existing plus project conditions.
Therefore, the project impact on freeway ramps would be less than significant.

Notes:
1. Ramp capacities were obtained from the Highway Capacity Manual 2000, and considered the free-flow speed, and the number of lanes on the ramp.
2. Existing peak hour volumes are obtained from personal communication with Caltrans staff Jordan Chan on September 17, 2015.



Freeway Ramps under Cumulative Conditions
The volume throughput of the studied freeway ramps are limited by the constraints of nearby
intersections. As Table 10 shows, all ramps currently operate well-below capacity. Under cumulative
conditions, even if the ramp volumes increase by 20%, they would still operate below capacity. Therefore,
the project impact on freeway ramps under cumulative conditions would be less than significant.

Cumulative Conditions
This chapter describes cumulative traffic conditions both with and without the proposed project.
Cumulative conditions reflect the traffic conditions that are projected to occur in the future if all of the
development projects that have been proposed in the study area were constructed and occupied.
Cumulative traffic volumes reflect traffic generated by the approved development projects (as included in
the Background scenario) and other proposed but not yet approved (pending) development projects. This
chapter describes the procedure used to determine cumulative traffic volumes and the resulting traffic
conditions, as well as the cumulative plus project conditions.

Roadway Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under cumulative conditions would be the
same as that described under existing conditions.

Pending Developments
Pending developments are those that have been proposed to local agencies but have not been approved.
The pending project list was obtained from the Town of Los Gatos and is included in Appendix B. Based
on a review of traffic studies prepared for these projects, a recent TRAFFIX file provided by the Town of
Los Gatos, the types and sizes of these developments, and their distances from the project site, the
following pending developments are expected to add traffic to at least one of the study intersections
during at least one of the peak hour periods:

Cumulative (No Project) Traffic Volumes
Cumulative peak hour traffic volumes were calculated by adding to background volumes the estimated
traffic from the pending developments. Vehicle trips for each of the pending projects were obtained from
the TRAFFIX file provided by the Town of Los Gatos or from the project’s traffic impact study. The
estimated trips were assigned to the study intersections according to the distributions and assignments
identified in the Town’s TRAFFIX file or the relevant traffic studies. Cumulative traffic volumes are shown
graphically on Figure 13.

Cumulative (No Project) Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under cumulative conditions without the proposed
project are summarized in Table 11. Under cumulative conditions, all signalized study intersections are
expected to operate at LOS D during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Cumulative Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The net new peak hour trips generated by the project were added to cumulative traffic volumes to obtain
cumulative plus project traffic volumes (see Figure 14). The net project trips and the trip distribution
pattern used to assign them to the roadway system were discussed in Chapter 4. Traffic volumes for all
components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.




                                                                                                34 | Page

Intersection LOS Under Cumulative Plus Project Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under cumulative plus project conditions show that
the study intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D) during both the AM and
PM peak hours of traffic (see Table 11).
At the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, the level of service presented in Table
11 assumes the proposed improvement to restripe Alberto Way to include a dedicated right-turn lane and
a shared left-through lane. When analyzed without the proposed improvement on Alberto Way, this
intersection would continue to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours with minimal
changes to critical delay and critical V/C.
Even though the project would not have a significant impact on the study intersections, it would be
required to pay a Traffic Impact Fee, as does all new development in the Town of Los Gatos. The Town’s
Traffic Impact Fee is unrelated to whether or not a project has any impacts under CEQA, and is required
of all new development projects that generate additional trips on the Town’s roadway network. The
current fee is $879 per new trip generated, as approved by the Town Council on March 24, 2014. The
project is expected to generate a net new 700 daily trips. The associated traffic impact fee is $615,300.
The purpose of the fee is to help fund transportation projects that are needed to accommodate vehicle trip
growth. Among the projects that will be funded with Traffic Impact Fees are three that are on SR 9, near
the project site:

       Intersection Improvements at SR 9 and N. Santa Cruz Avenue;

       SR 9 - Los Gatos Creek Trail connector – New path and bridge for bikes and pedestrians;

       Complete Streets Improvements – SR 9 from University Avenue to Los Gatos Blvd.

Other Transportation Issues

This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project site, including:
    Operations analysis – vehicle queuing and storage at selected intersections,
    Potential impacts to transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
    Site access, on-site circulation, and
    Parking.
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the Town of Los Gatos, the analyses
in this chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods
employed by the traffic engineering community.
Although operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts, they do describe traffic conditions that are
relevant to describing the project environment.

Operations Analysis
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of
“n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

         P (x n)      n e – ()
                             n!
Where:

         P (x n)  probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane

         n  number of vehicles in the queue per lane

         Average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
             per hour)
The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand left-turn movements at
intersections where 10 or more project trips were added. Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson
probability distribution. The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is
used to estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles for a particular movement; (2)
the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25
feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement to determine if adequate storage is available to
accommodate the 95th percentile queues. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future
storage requirements at intersections.


                                                                                             38 | Page
401-409 Alberto Way – Final Transportation Impact Analysis                                August 2, 2016


Vehicle queues were analyzed at the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road for the
southbound leg of Alberto Way and the eastbound left-turn movement on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. The
southbound leg of Alberto Way was analyzed to determine whether queues would block the proposed
southern driveway location (215 feet north of the intersection). The vehicle queuing estimates at these
two locations are provided in Table 12. Hexagon performed field observations at this intersection to
determine the average queue length. The reported existing queue lengths match our observations.
In order to accommodate left turn queues with the project, Hexagon recommends extending the
eastbound left-turn pocket on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road to 250 feet. The existing 150 feet left-turn
storage space would be insufficient to contain the queue with the project. With the proposed improvement
to extend the eastbound left-turn lane to 250 feet, the 95th percentile queue during both the AM and PM
peak hours would be sufficiently contained within the turn pocket. The applicant has agreed to make this
improvement. Based on community input, Hexagon also recommends restriping the southbound leg of
Alberto Way to include a right-turn lane and a shared left-through lane. Although not required to mitigate
project impacts, the applicant has agreed to make this improvement. A dedicated right-turn lane would
allow right-turn vehicles to bypass left-turn vehicles and turn onto westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
when Alberto Way has the red light and there are sufficient gaps to perform the turn.
The driveway on the east side of Alberto Way for the Best Western Inn is located approximately 125 feet
north of the intersection. The queuing analysis shows that during the PM peak hour under all but the
existing conditions, the 95th percentile queue on the southbound right-turn lane on Alberto Way (between
150 and 200 feet) would block vehicles at the Best Western driveway from turning into the right-turn lane.
The 95th percentile queue in the southbound shared left-through lane on Alberto Way would not block the
Best Western driveway. The 95th percentile queue during the PM peak hour in the southbound right-turn
lane on Alberto Way would comprise eight vehicles. It is expected that the existing signal at the Alberto
Way intersection would be able to clear all vehicles within each cycle. Right-turn vehicles on Alberto Way
also will be able to turn onto westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road when there are sufficient gaps in
westbound traffic on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Therefore, it is expected that vehicles at the Best
Western driveway would be able to turn onto Alberto Way with minimal delays.

Recommendations
Although not related to project impacts, Hexagon recommends that the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road at Alberto Way be upgraded, as well as interconnected to the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
at Los Gatos Boulevard. These improvements would improve vehicle progression on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road, which would help left-turn vehicles turning onto Alberto Way maneuver out of the eastbound
through lanes on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road and into the left-turn lane. This would improve the eastbound
left-turn green phase utilization on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, and reduce the potential for left-turn
vehicles having to wait extra cycles to be able to clear the intersection and lengthening the left-turn
queue. The project applicant has agreed to make these improvements.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
The project site is not connected to any existing bike facility within the immediate project vicinity. Nearby
bicycle facilities within the project vicinity include bike lanes on both sides of Los Gatos Boulevard, on
eastbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road between the Bella Vista Avenue overpass and Los Gatos
Boulevard, and on both sides of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road west of Wraight Avenue. The Los Gatos
Creek Trail runs parallel to SR 17 on the west side, but provides no access to the project site.
The Town of Los Gatos 2020 General Plan proposed a list of bicycle facility improvements within the
Town of Los Gatos. Since the publication of the General plan, all proposed improvements relative to
enhancing bicycle connectivity of the project site have been completed. The Highway 9 Safety
Improvement Project has identified a connecting ramp from the Los Gatos Creek Trail to Los Gatos-
Saratoga (SR 9) at University Avenue as part of their Phase II projects. At the time of this report, funding
remains to be secured for the proposed connecting ramp.
Access to the project site via Los Gatos Boulevard would require bikers to share the road with vehicles for
800 feet on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, which would be adequate for experienced cyclists. The lack of
bicycle facilities leading to the site means that inexperienced cyclists would not be encouraged to ride to
the project. The Town’s planned Complete Streets project on Los-Gatos-Saratoga Road (Highway 9)
could improve conditions for cyclists. The project would be required to contribute to this project via the
Town’s traffic impact fee.
At the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, the project voluntarily proposes to
restripe the southbound leg of Alberto Way to include a right-turn lane and a shared left-through lane. The
stop-bar for the shared left-through lane would be set back for a bike box. The proposed bike box would
increase bicyclist visibility for drivers and enhance bicyclist safety crossing the intersection. The
conceptual drawings for the proposed off-site improvements are shown on Figure 12 in Chapter 4.
Pedestrian activity could occur between the site and downtown Los Gatos, located approximately ½ mile
west, and the closest bus stops, located about ½ mile to the west and ¼ mile to the east. While adequate,
the pedestrian facilities could be improved. There are no sidewalks or crosswalks on the south side of Los
Gatos-Saratoga Road through the SR 17 interchange, only on the north side. The project would be
required to pay a transportation impact fee, which could be used to upgrade the pedestrian facilities in the
area.
As shown on Figure 12 in Chapter 4, the project applicant voluntarily proposes to provide detached
sidewalks with a landscape buffer on Alberto Way along the project site frontage, as well as on the north
side of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road between Alberto Way and the SR 17 northbound on-ramp. Detached
sidewalks with a landscape buffer would provide a wider buffer area between pedestrians and on-street
vehicles.
There is no transit service on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road in front of the site. The closest service is about ¼
mile east on Los Gatos Boulevard or ½ mile west at N. Santa Cruz Avenue. Sidewalks are present to
facilitate pedestrian movements between the project site and these transit stops.

Recommendations
While not required to improve Level of Service or to mitigate impacts related to traffic, it is recommended
that the proposed project implement the voluntary improvements to provide the bike box on Alberto Way
at the intersection with Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, as well as the detached sidewalks with a landscape
buffer on Alberto Way along the project site frontage, and on the north side of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
between Alberto Way and the SR 17 northbound on-ramp.




                                                                                             42 | Page

Site Access and Circulation
This section describes the site access and circulation of the proposed project. This review is based on
project site plans prepared by Arc Tec Inc. dated October 5, 2015 (see Figure 2).

Site Access
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveways with regard to corner sight
distance and traffic volumes. The proposed project would have one full-access driveway and one exit-
only driveway on Alberto Way. The northern full-access driveway would provide access to a 7-space
surface parking lot as well as the two-level below-grade parking garage. The 7-space surface parking lot
would have a one-way semicircular drive aisle, connecting to the southern exit-only driveway. Queuing
analysis (Table 12) has indicated that neither driveway would be blocked by the southbound queue at the
intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Therefore, access to the project driveways
would be adequate under all analyzed scenarios.
Corner Sight Distance
The project access points should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight distance, thereby
ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles traveling on
adjacent roadways. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a driver’s ability to locate a gap in
traffic and see oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists. Adequate corner sight distance (sight distance
triangles) should be provided at all site access points in accordance with the City’s standards. Sight
distance triangles should be measured approximately 15 feet back from the traveled way.
Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on Alberto Way is
25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 150 feet.
Alberto Way is slightly curved at the two driveway locations, but the curves do not block a driver’s view
150 feet down the road. No tall landscaping or signs exist near the driveways that would obstruct a
driver’s view. On-street parking is currently permitted between the two driveways. The parked vehicles
block a driver’s view at the south exit-only driveway, thereby obstructing visibility of southbound vehicles
on Alberto Way, and block a driver’s view of northbound vehicles at the north full-access driveway.

Recommendations
Parking on southbound Alberto Way between the two driveways should be prohibited to ensure adequate
sight distance.

On-Site Circulation
All driveway and drive-aisle widths are at least 24 feet wide, and comply with the minimum requirements
established in the Town of Los Gatos Code of Ordinances Section 29.10.155. All parking stalls within the
parking garage are 18 feet in length (16 feet with 2 feet overhang) and 8 feet 6 inches in width, which
meet the town’s requirements.

Emergency Vehicles, Truck Access and Circulation
The site plan shows that the trash pick-up area is at the northern driveway just before the ramps.
Garbage trucks would exit using the south exit-only driveway via the semi-circular surface drive-aisle. All
driveways and drive-aisles are at least 24 feet wide, which are adequate for emergency vehicle access
and circulation.




                                                                                            43 | Page
401-409 Alberto Way – Final Transportation Impact Analysis                                    August 2, 2016


Parking
For office use at the project site, the Town of Los Gatos Municipal Code Section 29.10.145 requires
parking to be provided at the rate of 1 parking space per 250 square feet of gross floor area. The project
proposes two office buildings totaling 92,800 square feet, which by code would be required to provide 372
parking spaces. The project site plan provides 395 parking spaces. Therefore, the parking provision as
shown on the current project site plans would meet the Town standards.
Per the California Building Code (CBC) Table 11B-6, eight (8) accessible spaces are required for parking
garages with 301 to 400 parking spaces. Of the required accessible parking spaces, one van accessible
space is required. As shown on the site plan, the project would provide eight (8) accessible parking
spaces, of which two (2) are accessed via the southern driveway, and the remaining six (6) are located in
the upper level of the below-grade garage near the elevators. The project site plan does not label which
one of the eight (8) parking spaces is van accessible.
The proposed restriping of Alberto Way would eliminate on-street parking spaces on Alberto Way along
the Best Western frontage. Hexagon also has recommended to prohibit parking on Alberto Way along the
project building frontage for sight distance issues exiting the project site. There is approximately 70 feet of
on-street parking along the Best Western frontage, and approximately 130 feet of on-street parking along
the project frontage. Combined, the proposed project would eliminate approximately eight vehicle-spaces
of on-street parking on Alberto Way. The five parking spaces along the project frontage could be
accommodated by the project parking garage. The removed parking spaces along the Best Western
frontage are assumed to be accommodated by its own parking facility.

Recommendations
The project is recommended to identify the van accessible parking space within the eight accessible
parking spaces. Hexagon recommends the project prohibit parking on Alberto Way along the project
building frontage to enhance sight distance for exiting vehicles.

7.
Conclusions

This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the Town of Los Gatos and the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA) Congestion Management Plan (CMP).
Per CMP technical guidelines, a freeway segment level of service analysis is required when a project
would add trips greater than one percent of a segment’s capacity. Although the proposed project would
add trips greater than one percent of capacity on southbound SR 17 from Lark Avenue to Los Gatos-
Saratoga Road during the AM peak hour, this freeway segment is currently operating at an acceptable
LOS D during the AM peak hour. The increase in segment trips would not significantly impact the freeway
LOS. Project impacts on other transportation categories, such as vehicle queuing, pedestrian, bicycle and
transit facilities, site access and on-site circulation, were determined on the basis of engineering
judgment.

Intersection Levels of Service
The intersection level of service analysis concluded that all study intersections would operate at
acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) under all study scenarios. Therefore, the proposed project
would have an insignificant impact on intersection levels of service.




                                                                                          45 | Page

Operations Analysis
Operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts. They are included for informational purposes.
In order to accommodate left turn queues with the project, Hexagon recommends extending the
eastbound left-turn pocket on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road to 250 feet. The existing 150 feet left-turn
storage space would be insufficient to contain the queue with the project. With the proposed improvement
to extend the eastbound left-turn lane to 250 feet, the 95th percentile queue during both the AM and PM
peak hours would be sufficiently contained within the turn pocket. The applicant has agreed to make this
improvement. Based on community input, Hexagon also recommends restriping the southbound leg of
Alberto Way to include a right-turn lane and a shared left-through lane. Although not required to mitigate
project impacts, the applicant has agreed to make this improvement. A dedicated right-turn lane would
allow right-turn vehicles to bypass left-turn vehicles and turn onto westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
when Alberto Way has the red light and there are sufficient gaps to perform the turn.
The driveway on the east side of Alberto Way for the Best Western Inn is located approximately 125 feet
north of the intersection. The queuing analysis shows that during the PM peak hour under all but the
existing conditions, the 95th percentile queue on the southbound right-turn lane on Alberto Way (between
150 and 200 feet) would block vehicles at the Best Western driveway from turning into the right-turn lane.
The 95th percentile queue in the southbound shared left-through lane on Alberto Way would not block the
Best Western driveway. The 95th percentile queue during the PM peak hour in the southbound right-turn
lane on Alberto Way would comprise eight vehicles. It is expected that the existing signal at the Alberto
Way intersection would be able to clear all vehicles within each cycle. Right-turn vehicles on Alberto Way
also will be able to turn onto westbound Los Gatos-Saratoga Road when there are sufficient gaps in
westbound traffic on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Therefore, it is expected that vehicles at the Best
Western driveway would be able to turn onto Alberto Way with minimal delays.

Recommendations
Although not related to project impacts, Hexagon recommends that the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road at Alberto Way be upgraded, as well as interconnected to the signal on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
at Los Gatos Boulevard. These improvements would improve vehicle progression on Los Gatos-Saratoga
Road, which would help left-turn vehicles turning onto Alberto Way maneuver out of the eastbound
through lanes on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road and into the left-turn lane. This would improve the eastbound
left-turn green phase utilization on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, and reduce the potential for left-turn
vehicles having to wait extra cycles to be able to clear the intersection and lengthening the left-turn
queue. The project applicant has agreed to make these improvements.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
The project site is not connected to nearby bicycle facilities. Access to the project site via Los Gatos
Boulevard would require bikers to share the road with vehicles for 800 feet on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road,
which would be adequate for experienced cyclists. The lack of bicycle facilities leading to the site means
that inexperienced cyclists would not be encouraged to ride to the project. The Town’s planned Complete
Streets project on Los-Gatos-Saratoga Road (Highway 9) could improve conditions for cyclists. The
project would be required to contribute to this project via the Town’s traffic impact fee.
While not required as CEQA mitigation or to address traffic operations, the project voluntarily proposes to
restripe the southbound leg of Alberto Way to include a right-turn lane and a shared left-through lane. At
the intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, the stop-bar for the shared left-through
lane would be set back for a voluntarily proposed bike box. The proposed bike box would increase
bicyclist visibility for drivers and enhance bicyclist safety crossing the intersection. The conceptual
drawings for the proposed improvements are shown on Figure 12 in Chapter 4.




                                                                                           46 | Page
401-409 Alberto Way – Final Transportation Impact Analysis                                 August 2, 2016


Pedestrian activity could occur between the site and downtown Los Gatos, located approximately ½ mile
west, and the closest bus stops, located about ½ mile to the west and ¼ mile to the east. While adequate,
the pedestrian facilities could be improved. There are no sidewalks or crosswalks on the south side of Los
Gatos-Saratoga Road through the SR 17 interchange, only on the north side. The project would be
required to pay a transportation impact fee, which could be used to upgrade the pedestrian facilities in the
area.
As shown on Figure 12 in Chapter 4, the project applicant voluntarily proposes to provide detached
sidewalks with a landscape buffer on Alberto Way along the project site frontage, as well as on the north
side of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road between Alberto Way and the SR 17 northbound on-ramp. Detached
sidewalks with a landscape buffer would provide a wider buffer area between pedestrians and on-street
vehicles.
There is no transit service on Los Gatos-Saratoga Road in front of the site. The closest service is about ¼
mile east on Los Gatos Boulevard or ½ mile west at N. Santa Cruz Avenue. Sidewalks are present to
facilitate pedestrian movements between the project site and these transit stops.

Recommendations
While not required to improve Level of Service or to mitigate impacts related to traffic, it is recommended
that the proposed project implement the voluntary improvements to provide the bike box on Alberto Way
at the intersection with Los Gatos-Saratoga Road, as well as the detached sidewalks with a landscape
buffer on Alberto Way along the project site frontage, and on the north side of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road
between Alberto Way and the SR 17 northbound on-ramp.

Site Access and Circulation
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveways with regard to corner sight
distance and traffic volumes. The proposed project would have one full-access driveway and one exit-
only driveway on Alberto Way. The northern full-access driveway would provide access to a 7-space
surface parking lot as well as the two-level below-grade parking garage. The 7-space surface parking lot
would have a one-way semicircular drive aisle, connecting to the southern exit-only driveway. Queuing
analysis has indicated that neither driveway would be blocked by the southbound queue at the
intersection of Alberto Way and Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. Therefore, access to the project driveways
would be adequate under all analyzed scenarios.
Corner Sight Distance
Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on Alberto Way is
25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 150 feet. The site plan
shows no tall landscaping or signs near either driveway that would block a driver’s view. Sight distance
for the southern driveway would be adequate. Alberto Way is slightly curved at the two driveway
locations, but the curves do not block a driver’s view 150 feet down the road. No tall landscaping or signs
exist near the driveways that would obstruct a driver’s view. On-street parking is currently permitted
between the two driveways. The parked vehicles block a driver’s view at the south exit-only driveway,
thereby obstructing visibility of southbound vehicles on Alberto Way, and block a driver’s view of
northbound vehicles at the north full-access driveway.

Recommendations
Parking on southbound Alberto Way between the two driveways should be prohibited to ensure adequate
sight distance.

On-Site Circulation
All driveway and drive-aisle widths are at least 24 feet wide, and comply with the minimum requirements
established in the Town of Los Gatos Code of Ordinances Section 29.10.155. All parking stalls within the
parking garage are 18 feet in length (16 feet with 2 feet overhang) and 8 feet 6 inches in width, which
meet the town’s requirements.

Emergency Vehicles, Truck Access and Circulation
The site plan shows that the trash pick-up area is at the northern driveway just before the ramps.
Garbage trucks would exit using the south exit-only driveway via the semi-circular surface drive-aisle. All
driveways and drive-aisles are at least 24 feet wide, which are adequate for emergency vehicle access
and circulation.

Parking
For office use at the project site, the Town of Los Gatos Municipal Code Section 29.10.145 requires
parking to be provided at the rate of 1 parking space per 250 square feet of gross floor area. The project
proposes two office buildings totaling 92,800 square feet, which by code would be required to provide 372
parking spaces. The project site plan provides 395 parking spaces. Parking provision as shown on the
current project site plans would meet the Town standards.
Per the California Building Code (CBC) Table 11B-6, eight (8) accessible spaces are required for parking
garages with 301 to 400 parking spaces. Of the required accessible parking spaces, one van accessible
space is required. As shown on the site plan, the project would provide eight (8) accessible parking
spaces, of which two (2) are accessed via the southern driveway, and the remaining six (6) are located in
the upper level of the below-grade garage near the elevators. The project site plan does not label which
one of the eight (8) parking spaces is van accessible.
The proposed restriping of Alberto Way would eliminate on-street parking spaces on Alberto Way along
the Best Western frontage. Hexagon also has recommended to prohibit parking on Alberto Way along the
project building frontage for sight distance issues exiting the project site. There is approximately 70 feet of
on-street parking along the Best Western frontage, and approximately 130 feet of on-street parking along
the project frontage. Combined, the proposed project would eliminate approximately eight vehicle-spaces
of on-street parking on Alberto Way. The five parking spaces along the project frontage could be
accommodated by the project parking garage. The removed parking spaces along the Best Western
frontage are assumed to be accommodated by its own parking facility.

Recommendations
The project is recommended to identify the van accessible parking space within the eight accessible
parking spaces. Hexagon recommends the project prohibit parking on Alberto Way along the project
building frontage to enhance sight distance for exiting vehicles.
