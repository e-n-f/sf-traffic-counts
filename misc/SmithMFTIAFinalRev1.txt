1. DEVELOPMENT IDENTIFICATION

Gibson Traffic Consultants, Inc. (GTC) has been retained to provide a traffic impact analysis for
the proposed Smith Multi-Family development to address impacts on the surrounding City of
Richland roadways with two alternative access scenarios. Brad Lincoln, responsible for this report
and traffic analysis, is a licensed professional engineer (Civil) in the State of Washington and
member of the Washington State section of ITE.

The Smith Multi-Family development is proposed to consist of a total of 112 apartment units on
land that is currently vacant. The development site is located east of Leslie Road and is adjacent
to the Willowbrook #2 development. A site vicinity map has been included in Figure 1.


2. METHODOLOGY

Trip generation calculations for the Smith Multi-Family development have been performed
utilizing average trip generation data contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE)
Trip Generation, 9th Edition (2012). The distribution of trips generated by the site is based on the
counts at the study intersection and surrounding land uses.

The analysis in this report is based on scoping discussions with City of Richland staff and includes
an analysis of daily trip volumes and intersection operations for both access scenarios. The daily
trips along the following roadways have been compared to typical City of Richland thresholds:

      Piper Street –Eastwood Avenue vicinity
      Center Boulevard – east of Leslie Road

Piper Street is classified as a Local Street and has a typical threshold of approximately 1,000 daily
trips. Center Boulevard is classified as a Neighborhood Collector and has a typical threshold of
approximately 1,500 daily trips. It is important to note that these thresholds are approximate,
especially since both Piper Street and Center Boulevard meet the description of a Neighborhood
Collector Street.

Intersection level of service analysis has been performed for the AM peak-hour, the highest four
consecutive 15-minute periods between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak-hour, the highest
four consecutive 15-minute periods between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The intersection level of
service analysis has been performed for the following intersections:

   1. Leslie Road at Willowbrook Place
   2. Leslie Road at Center Boulevard

Congestion at intersections is generally measured in terms of level of service (LOS). In accordance
with Highway Capacity Manual: 2010 Edition (HCM) by the Transportation Research Board, road
facilities and intersections are rated between LOS A and LOS F, with LOS A being free flow and
LOS F being forced flow or over-capacity conditions. The level of service at signalized,
roundabout and all-way stop-controlled intersections is based on the average delay of all
approaches. The level of service for two-way stop-controlled intersections is based on average
delays for the stopped approach with the highest delay. Geometric characteristics and conflicting
traffic movements are taken into consideration when determining level of service values. A
summary of the intersection level of service criteria is included in Table 1.

                          Table 1: Level of Service Criteria for Intersections

                                                                Intersection Control Delay

The City of Richland utilizes an intersection level of service threshold of LOS D.




1   Source: Highway Capacity Manual 2010.

     LOS A: Free-flow traffic conditions, with minimal delay to stopped vehicles (no vehicle is delayed longer
              than one cycle at signalized intersection).
     LOS B: Generally stable traffic flow conditions.
     LOS C: Occasional back-ups may develop, but delay to vehicles is short term and still tolerable.
     LOS D: During short periods of the peak hour, delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial but are
              tolerable during times of less demand (i.e. vehicles delayed one cycle or less at signal).
     LOS E: Intersections operate at or near capacity, with long queues developing on all approaches and long
              delays.
     LOS F: Jammed conditions on all approaches with excessively long delays and vehicles unable to move at
              times.
2   When demand volume exceeds the capacity of the lane, extreme delays will be encountered with queuing which
    may cause severe congestion affecting other traffic movements in the intersection.

3. SURROUNDING AREA

The primary roadway in the site vicinity is Leslie Road; which is a 3-lane arterial roadway with a
posted speed limit of 40 mph. Center Boulevard and Willowbrook Place are 2-lane neighborhood
collectors with posted speed limits of 25 mph. Both roadways have approximately 38 feet of
pavement. The intersections of Center Boulevard and Willowbrook Place at Leslie Road are both
two-way stop-controlled intersections with stop-control only being on Center Boulevard and
Willowbrook Place. There is left-turn channelization on Leslie Road at both intersections.

Piper Street is a 2-lane local street with a posted speed limit of 25 mph and approximately 34 feet
of pavement. All of these roadways include curb, gutter and sidewalks. The local intersections
internal to the Willowbrook development are uncontrolled intersections. The single-family
residential units have direct access to the local internal roadways.

The surrounding land use if primarily residential. The major commercial areas are west and north
of the site. The major highway in the site vicinity is I-82 with the nearest access being south of the
development.


4. TRIP GENERATION

The trip generation calculations for the Smith Multi-Family development are based on the average
trip generation rates for Institute of transportation Engineers ITE Land Use Code 220, apartments.
The trip generation of the Smith Multi-Family development is summarized in Table 2.

The trip generation calculations are included in the attachments.

In addition to the Smith Multi-Family development, City of Richland staff asked that the
Willowbrook #2 development be included as a pipeline development. The Willowbrook #2
development is proposed to consist of 98 total single-family residential units. However, there are
currently 34 units that have been constructed, based on available aerial data. The trip generation
from these trips is therefore included in the count data. The local trip generation of the remaining
64 units of the Willowbrook #2 development have been calculated based on the count data
collected at the intersections of Leslie Road at Willowbrook Place and Leslie Road at Center
Boulevard. The trip generation for the remaining units of the Willowbrook #2 development is
summarized in Table 3.

The count data is discussed in more detail later in this report and the local trip generation
calculations are included in the attachments. It is important to note that the Willowbrook #2 local
trip generation data is similar to standard ITE trip generation rates for single-family residential
units, ITE Land Use Code 210.


5. TRIP DISTRIBUTION

The trips generated by the Smith Multi-Family development and the remaining units of the
Willowbrook #2 development have been calculated based on the existing count data and how the
internal roadways will be connected.

       5.1 Overall Trip Distribution

The overall trip distribution of the Smith Multi-Family development and the remaining units of
the Willowbrook #2 development is based on turning movement counts at the two study
intersections. The count data shows that 75% of the trips from the development area travel to and
from the north and 25% travel to and from the south along Leslie Road. This distribution is not
anticipated to change with the local access scenarios discussed below.

       5.2 Local Trip Distribution

The distribution of trips from the Smith Multi-Family development and the remaining units of the
Willowbrook #2 development at the two study intersections and along the local roadways is based
on the location of the development and the access scenario. The City of Richland staff asked that
two accesses scenarios be reviewed. The Smith Multi-Family development is proposing to include
an extension of Center Boulevard, the Center Boulevard Access Scenario. The Willowbrook #2
development is only proposing to extend Piper Street to the south to connect with Willowbrook
Avenue, the Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario. The local distribution for each scenario is discussed
below.

           5.2.1. Center Boulevard Access Scenario

The Smith Multi-Family development is proposing to extend Center Boulevard from the current
terminus to the east to provide access through an existing 80-foot easement created to provide
access to the property of the Smith Multi-Family development. Additionally, this Center
Boulevard extension would connect to the Piper Street extension to the south that would be
completed by the development of the remaining units of the Willowbrook #2 development. This
access scenario is anticipated to result in the trips from Smith Multi-Family residential
development being split 50% to the Willowbrook Place intersection and 50% to the Center
Boulevard intersection. The assignments of trips generated by the Smith Multi-Family
development with the Center Boulevard Access Scenario are shown in Figure 2.

The remaining units of the Willowbrook #2 development are generally located south of the Center
Boulevard extension. The location of these units is anticipated to result in the trips from the
remaining units of the Willowbrook #2 development being split 25% to the Willowbrook Place
intersection and 75% to the Center Boulevard intersection. The assignments of trips generated by
the remaining units of the Willowbrook #2 development with the Center Boulevard Access
Scenario are shown in Figure 3.

           5.2.2. Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario

City of Richland staff also requested during the scoping process that the proposed Willowbrook
#2 access be analyzed. The Willowbrook #2 development is proposing to not extend Center
Boulevard and only provide access via an extension of Piper Street south to the intersection of
Center Boulevard at Willowbrook Avenue. Due to the change in access, it is anticipated that 60%
of the trips from the Smith Multi-Family development will utilize the Willowbrook Place
intersection and 40% will utilize the Center Boulevard intersection. The assignments of trips
generated by the Smith Multi-Family development with the Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario are
shown in Figure 4.

The distribution of trips from the 64 remaining units of the Willowbrook #2 development is not
anticipated to change with the Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario. The remaining units are generally
located to the south and are closer to Center Boulevard. The trips from the remaining units of the
Willowbrook #2 development with the Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario are the same as those
shown in Figure 3.

6. DAILY VOLUME ANALYSIS

The City of Richland staff has requested that the daily trips along Piper Street and Center
Boulevard be analyzed with the Smith Multi-Family and Willowbrook #2 developments. Piper
Street is classified as a Local Street and Center Boulevard is classified as a Neighborhood
Collector, based on information from City of Renton staff. The typical daily trip thresholds are
based on Richland Municipal Code (RMC) 12.02. It is important to note that these typical
thresholds and not specific limits. Piper Street, a Local Street, has a typical threshold of 1,000 daily
trips and Center Boulevard, a Neighborhood Collector, has a typical threshold of 1,500 daily trips.

The Piper Street daily trip volume has been evaluated for the north section, west of Eastwood
Avenue. The existing daily trips are based on the number of units utilizing this section of the
roadway, estimated to be 95 units. These units include the 34 existing units of the Willowbrook
#2 development. Actual count data was not collected on Piper Street due to the driveways along
this section of the roadway and therefore the existing volume is based on the trip generation rate
(7.87 daily trips per unit) calculated earlier in the report and the number of units. The Center
Boulevard daily trip volume is based on daily count data collected on Center Boulevard east of
Leslie Road.

The daily volumes on Piper Street and Center Boulevard with the Smith Multi-Family and
Willowbrook #2 development have been summarized in Table 4 with the Center Road Access
Scenario. The trips added by the Smith Multi-Family and Willowbrook #2 developments are based
on the local distribution discussed earlier in this report.

The analysis shows that approximately 1,247 daily trips will be on Piper Street and approximately
1,176 daily trips will be on Center Boulevard with the Center Boulevard Access Scenario.

The daily volumes on Piper Street and Center Boulevard with the Smith Multi-Family and
Willowbrook #2 development have been summarized in Table 5 with the Willowbrook #2 Access
Scenario. The trips added by the Smith Multi-Family and Willowbrook #2 developments are based
on the local distribution discussed earlier in this report.

The analysis shows that approximately 1,321 daily trips will be on Piper Street and approximately
1,101 daily trips will be on Center Boulevard with the Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario.

The analysis shows that Piper Street is anticipated to have more than 1,000 daily trips with the
Smith Multi-Family and Willowbrook #2 development. However, the extension of Center
Boulevard that is proposed as part of the Smith Multi-Family development will result in lower
trips along Piper Street. Regardless, the daily volumes should be acceptable since Piper Street is
wide enough to allow for one lane in each direction and parking on both sides of the roadway. It
is also important to note that the daily trips volumes are within the typical range of the industry
standards from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO).


7. INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

The intersections that have been analyzed as part of this report are based on scoping discussions
with City of Richland staff. Level of service analysis has been performed for the following
intersections for the weekday AM peak-hour (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and PM peak-hour (4:00 PM
to 6:00 PM):

   1. Leslie Road at Willowbrook Place
   2. Leslie Road at Center Boulevard

The AM peak-hour is the highest consecutive 15-minute periods between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM.
The PM peak-hour is the highest consecutive 15-minute periods between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.

       7.1 Turning Movement Volumes

The existing turning movements at the study intersections were counted by the independent count
firm of idax. The turning movement counts were collected in December of 2014. The existing
turning movements at the study intersections are shown in Figure 5.

The future volumes have been calculated for the year 2024, which represents a 10-year horizon
period. The 2024 turning movements have been calculated by applying a 1% annually
compounding growth rate to the northbound and southbound trips along Leslie Road to account
for development in the area. The 2024 turning movements have been calculated with the Center
Road Access Scenario, shown in Figure 6, and the Willowbrook #2 Access Scenario, shown in
Figure 7. The turning movement calculations are included in the attachments.

are anticipated to generate 504 daily trips with 42 AM peak-hour trips and 55 PM peak-hour trips.
The daily trip analysis shows that the Center Boulevard Access Scenario will keep the daily trips
on Piper Street closest to the typical threshold of 1,000 daily trips. The daily trips on Center
Boulevard are anticipated to remain below 1,500 daily trips, regardless of the access scenario.
Additionally, neither access scenario is anticipated to significantly change the operations at the
study intersections.

It is recommended that the Center Boulevard Access Scenario be implemented to keep the daily
volumes on Piper Street as close to the typical threshold as possible.
