1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the traffic monitoring study conducted at the Port of Seattle’s Terminal
91 in September 2015. This study was conducted in accordance with the Terminal 91 Short Fill Redevel-
opment Agreement 1 (SFRA) between the Port of Seattle (Port) and the neighborhood community councils
of Magnolia and Queen Anne (Communities). For this analysis, new traffic counts were collected at all
Terminal 91 access points and compared to thresholds identified in the SFRA. The results of this study
were also compared to previous studies conducted since 2009, when the Port opened Smith Cove Cruise
Terminal.


2.      MONITORING PROCESS AND THRESHOLDS
The SFRA was a “comprehensive resolution of all disputes regarding the Port’s ‘short fill’ redevelopment
of Terminal 91.” Additionally, the SRFA provided procedures for resolving future issues. The establish-
ment of a traffic monitoring program was one of the elements of the SFRA, and detailed procedures for
monitoring traffic are outlined in Section F of the agreement. It states that, “the purpose of the monitoring
program is to determine whether future traffic volumes and levels of service stay within estimated ranges.
The Port and the Communities have established “trigger” levels for traffic volumes which, if exceeded,
will result in more intensive review by the Port and action if required.”

Key steps within the monitoring program stated in the SFRA are as follows:

             Gates: The Port will obtain daily (24 hour), AM and PM peak period gate counts of
             trucks and autos entering or leaving all Terminal 91 gates for one (1) week each
             quarter. Gate counts will be reported as trip ends. A trip end is an arrival or a depar-
             ture. Thus, a single vehicle which enters and then leaves the terminal will generate two
             trip ends.

             Intersections: Congestion and delay at intersections are measured in terms of Level of
             Service (LOS) under a system described in Interim Materials on Highway Capacity
             (Transportation Research Board, 1980). Levels of service range from A through F,
             with LOS A representing congestion-free service and LOS F representing jammed con-
             ditions. The Port will obtain LOS determinations for the peak hours at the following
             intersections once a year: Elliott and Galer; Elliott/15th Avenue and Garfield; 15th and
             Dravus (until Galer access is completed), West Mercer Place and Elliott; and 20th and
             Dravus.

According to industry standard, the methodology to determine level of service has been updated many
times since this agreement was originally drafted. Computers now allow more complex calculations to
occur, which have resulted in more accurate analyses of intersection operations. The newest methodolo-
gies from the 2010 edition of the Highway Capacity Manual 2 were used to evaluate intersection
operations. Details related to the methodology are provided in Section 5.3.

                                                                                                   2015 Traffic Monitoring Study

Another change that has occurred since the SFRA was created is construction of the Galer Flyover.
Therefore, the Galer Flyover/Elliott Avenue W intersection was evaluated instead of the Galer Street
/Elliott Avenue intersection (which still exists, but is a minor intersection with no connection across the
railroad tracks to Terminal 91). Finally, the North Gate to Terminal 91 is not currently active; therefore,
no analysis was performed for intersections along W Dravus Street for this monitoring study.

The SFRA outlined thresholds for both auto and truck traffic volumes over three specific time periods.
The time periods and volume thresholds are summarized in Table 1. It is noted that the AM and PM
peak periods differ from traditional traffic analysis time periods. The SFRA defines a 75-minute period
for the AM peak and a 105-minute period for the PM peak; a typical traffic analysis would evaluate a
60-minute peak period.

            1.    Thresholds are listed for total trip ends. A vehicle that enters the terminal and then exits the terminal
                  would count as two trip ends.



3.      GATE AND TERMINAL COUNTS
3.1. Count Locations
There are currently three locations where vehicular traffic can enter and exit Terminal 91; these are
shown on Figure 1.

        1. East Gate – This gate is located off Alaskan Way W, and is accessed via the Galer
           Flyover.

        2. Center Gate – This gate is accessed via the center ramps of the Magnolia Bridge just
           west of 15th Avenue W. The Center Gate is closed on weekends.

        3. West Access – On days with cruise activity, a retractable gate at the west end of the
           Magnolia Bridge is open. Vehicles can enter this gate and park, or traverse the yard
           beneath the Magnolia Bridge to access Pier 91 south of the bridge. Vehicles also exit
           the parking lot via this gate. When cruise vessels are at sea, the gate is closed to secure
           the parking lot.




                                                               -2-                                                       May 18, 2016
                                                                                            Terminal 91
                                                                           2015 Traffic Monitoring Study

             Figure 1. Terminal 91 Access Points




Vehicle classification counts were performed at all three Terminal 91 access locations in September
2015. The machine traffic counts (performed by pneumatic tubes) track the types of vehicles entering
and exiting the terminals for each hour of the day. These data were collected over a ten-day period from
Friday, September 4, 2015 through Sunday, September 13, 2015. To augment the machine counts,
camera counts were performed for four days: Thursday September 10, Friday September 11, Saturday
September 12, and Sunday September 13. Three of these days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday were
cruise days and Thursday was a non-cruise day. These counts were performed during the peak hours for
disembarkation (7:30 – 9:45 A.M.) and embarkation (11:00 A.M. – 12:45 P.M.). The vehicle types were
categorized: passenger vehicle (non-commercial), taxi, limo/towncar, shuttle van/bus, charter bus,
school bus, small truck, medium truck and large truck.

The machine counts classify vehicles by number and spacing of axles; however, the accuracy of the ma-
chine classification counts can be affected by travel speed. A vehicle that travels faster or slower than
expected could be registered as a different type of vehicle. For example, a large truck could be recorded
as two closely-spaced passenger vehicles. The camera counts were used to validate the machine counts
and determine if adjustments were needed.


3.2. Cruise Vessel Schedule
 Cruise vessels called at Terminal 91 on seven of the ten days surveyed in September 2015. Table 2
 presents the cruise schedule during the survey period, and the numbers of passengers that embarked
 or disembarked each vessel while it was at Terminal 91. As shown, the highest passenger volumes
 occurred on the two surveyed Saturdays when two ships called at Terminal 91. There were no cruise
 ship calls on Wednesday or Thursday of the survey week.

3.3. Automobile Traffic (including Vans/Shuttles)
Automobile traffic that entered or exited Terminal 91 was summed for all three access locations. The total
reflects the “trip ends” defined by the SFRA. Vans and small shuttles, such as those used by Shuttle
Express and other service providers, are classified as an automobile. Table 3 summarizes the automobile
trip ends and compares them to the thresholds established in the SFRA. Figure 2 through Figure 4 show
these data graphically for the three respective time periods. As shown, the AM peak period exceeded the
thresholds on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays when there were two cruise ships that called at the terminal
each day; volumes did not exceed the threshold on Monday or Tuesday when there was only one cruise
ship call. Daily automobile thresholds were exceeded on six of the seven days when there was cruise
activity at the terminal. The daily threshold was not exceeded on Monday, which was the Labor Day
Holiday, and had lower traffic generated by non-cruise uses at the terminal. None of the days exceeded the
threshold for the PM peak period.

The locations where traffic enters the terminal vary depending on cruise operations. The volume by
access is shown on Figure 5. On days without a cruise ship call, the parking lot at the West Access is
gated, and the very small number of trips that entered or exiting the terminal at the West Gate is likely
related to security personnel (4 or fewer trips on those days). The Center Gate is used by non-cruise
traffic, and is closed on weekends and holidays. On weekdays, the number of automobiles using the
Center Gate does not vary substantially between a cruise day and a non-cruise day. The largest
fluctuations in volume occur at the East Gate on days when there is cruise activity. Figure 5 shows the
daily automobile volumes by access location.

3.4. Truck Traffic (and other Large Vehicles)
As with prior Terminal 91 monitoring efforts, the “truck traffic” thresholds were measured for all large
vehicles generated by Terminal 91 including charter buses, school buses, and shuttles. Almost all large
vehicles access the terminal through the East Gate; vertical clearance issues prevent large trucks from
using the other two access points, although some smaller trucks and shuttles may use those gates. The
volumes of trucks, buses, and shuttles were derived from the adjusted vehicle classification counts. The
total number of trip ends for all three access locations is summarized in Table 4. As shown, the volume
of trucks and buses exceeded the AM peak and daily thresholds on all days of the week. The PM peak
threshold was exceeded on four weekdays; Monday was a holiday.

The types of vehicles were compiled for each day to show the proportion of each type of large vehicle:
buses, small and medium trucks (2 to 4 axles), and large trucks (more than 5 axles). These are shown on
Figure 6. It is noted that the First Student School Bus base that was formerly located at Terminal 91 is
no longer in operation; it closed prior to the 2014 survey. There were no school buses observed during
the survey; all buses are charter buses associated with cruise activity.

4.      HISTORIC TRENDS
This section compares results from the three most recent traffic monitoring studies—September 2013,
2014 and 2015—representing the conditions after the Port opened Smith Cove Cruise Terminal in 2009.


4.1. Passenger Trends
Traffic volumes at Terminal 91 fluctuate from day to day. The largest changes result from cruise activi-
ties. Figure 7 shows the number of passengers that embark and disembark cruise ships at the terminal by
day of week for the past three monitoring years. As shown, cruise activity in the mid-week has changed
over the years; in 2015 there were no ships on Wednesday or Thursday. The weekend activity has
remained relatively consistent over the years. The change in cruise activity on Friday between 2014 and
2015 was due to two cruise ships on Fridays instead of one ship in prior years.




                                                             -9-                                                    May 18, 2016

4.2. Automobile Traffic Trends
Figures 8, 9, and 10 compare historic automobile traffic monitoring results for the AM peak, PM peak
and 24-hour periods, respectively. Aside from one anomaly in 2014 (Saturday during the AM peak
hour), traffic volumes are consistent among the years, and proportional to the changes in cruise
passenger traffic. Data for Thursdays, which is the one day when no cruise activity occurred during the
past three years, show that non-cruise traffic at Terminal 91 has decreased each year since 2013 for all
three time periods evaluated.

4.3. Truck and Bus Traffic Trends
Figures 11, 12, and 13 compare truck volumes to prior monitoring results for the AM peak, PM peak,
and 24-hour periods, respectively. These volumes include buses and trucks. Both the AM peak period
and daily volumes of trucks have generally remained the same during the weekdays (the sharp increase
on Tuesday in the number of trucks likely represents the deliveries that could not occur on Monday due
to the holiday) but increased on the weekends (including Friday). The number of trucks and buses
during the PM peak period has decreased from 2013 to 2015, likely a result of school buses no longer
being stored at Terminal 91.

5.      INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
5.1. Trigger Levels
The SFRA established level of service trigger levels for three off-site intersections. Level of service is a
qualitative measure used to characterize traffic operating conditions. Six letter designations, “A” through
“F,” are used to define level of service. LOS A is the best and represents good traffic operations with little
or no delay to motorists. LOS F is the worst and indicates poor traffic operations with long delays. The
trigger levels are summarized in Table 5. It is noted that the SFRA included the W Galer Street intersec-
tion on Elliott Avenue W, which was the primary access to Terminal 91 when the SFRA was created. That
access has been replaced with the Galer Street Flyover. Therefore, the trigger level previously established
for Galer Street was applied to the Elliott Avenue W/Galer Flyover intersection.

As previously discussed, the level of service methodology prescribed by the SFRA (Critical Lane Analy-
sis) is outdated. Computers now allow more complex calculations to occur, which have resulted in more
accurate analyses of intersection operations. For this study, intersection levels of service were deter-
mined using the methodologies in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation
Research Board, 2010), which serves as the industry standard. Levels of service for study area intersec-
tions were calculated using Trafficware’s Synchro 8.0 traffic operations analysis software, which is also
the latest version of software and corresponds to the 2010 methodology. Current level of service criteria
for signalized intersections can be found in Appendix A.

In 2013, SDOT installed Traffic Responsive Operations Systems technology along the Elliott/15th Avenue
corridor between W Armour Street and W Harrison Street. The signalized intersections along this corridor
section use volume detection technology to change the traffic signal cycles and operation based on traffic
volume. The technology allows for 15 different operational programs that are available during the day
(five AM peak hour options, five PM peak hour options, and five off-peak options), instead of just one per
time period under the former signal system. Each operational program is triggered when a specific traffic
demand threshold is met. Since the operations can change as volumes change throughout the day, SDOT
staff recommended that the Synchro model’s cycle length and signal phase times should be “optimized”
for each condition. 3 This analysis uses the recommended approach.

Levels of service models developed by Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) for the Elliott/15th
Avenue corridor were used for all analyses; these models reflect the current configuration (with the BAT
lanes) and the volume-responsive traffic signal timing.


5.2. Year 2015 Traffic Volumes
New intersection counts were performed at all three study intersections on Thursday September 10,
2015. These volumes were performed when no cruise activity was occurring at the Port. Traffic volumes
are reported for the morning and afternoon peak hour on the Elliott/15th Avenue corridor, which
occurred from 7:45 to 8:45 A.M. and from 4:45 to 5:45 P.M. It is noted that these peak hours differ from
the longer-than-60-minute periods prescribed by the SFRA. The peak hours were selected to meet
industry standard for traffic analysis and level of service definitions, and are consistent with other traffic
studies performed by the City of Seattle. Traffic volumes without a cruise are shown on Figures 15 and
16 for the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

It is interesting to note that traffic volumes have changed very little since the monitoring study was per-
formed in September 2011. For each year since 2011, the total number of vehicles entering each of the
intersections during the peak hours is compared on Figure 14. All sets of counts reflect September
conditions without cruise activity at Terminal 91.Except for the intersection at W Garfield Street/15th
Avenue W, traffic volumes entering each intersection in 2015 is slightly lower than in the three prior
years. That intersection had slightly higher southbound through volumes during the PM peak hour than
in prior years.

                  Figure 14. Total Traffic Entering Intersection – Without Cruise Activity




Source: Intersection turning movement counts performed for the respective Terminal 91 Monitoring Studies. All sets of counts reflect
September conditions without cruise activity at Terminal 91.



The gate counts described in the prior sections were used to determine the net change in AM and PM peak
hour traffic associated with cruise activity at Terminal 91. Two conditions with cruise activity were
evaluated: a typical weekday with one ship call at the terminal (Tuesday) and a peak weekday with two ship
calls (Friday). These were compared to a day with no cruise (Thursday) to determine the traffic associated
with cruise activity. The trip generation estimates are summarized in Table 6. As shown, cruise related trips
are highest during the AM peak hour with 690 trips generated on the peak Friday. During the PM peak hour,
on the same day, there were 69 cruise-related trips.

It is noted that during the PM peak hour, the trips derived for the one-ship condition are higher than for the
two-ship condition. This is likely due to the fact that the two-ship condition occurred on a Friday, and
background traffic generated by other uses at the terminal may have been lower during the late afternoon on
Friday than during other days of the week. Therefore, trips generated for the one-ship condition reflects the
worst-case condition. Analysis from prior years shows that the cruise terminal generates little to no traffic in
the afternoon peak hour since the ships have already left port during that time period.

The additional peak hour traffic generated by the cruise terminal on an average weekday (with one ship call)
and the peak weekday (two ship calls) was distributed to the roadway network and assigned to the study-area
intersections according to travel patterns defined by traffic counts performed for the 2010 Monitoring study.
It is noted that in 2015, two cruise ships called at Terminal 91 on 52 days, of which 17 were Fridays and the
rest were weekend days. The AM and PM cruise terminal trips are shown on Figures 17 and 18, respectively.

5.3. Level of Service Analysis
Peak hour traffic volumes shown on Figures 15 through 18 were used to determine the levels of service
for study-area intersections. This analysis reflects existing conditions on a normal day (without cruise
operations at Terminal 91), on a weekday with an average cruise (one ship call), and on a weekday with
peak cruise operations (two ship calls). The methodology used to determine level of service was
described in Section 5.1 above. The results are summarized in Table 7.

The level of service results for the without cruise and average cruise conditions are very similar to the
results from 2011, 2013 and 2014 when weekdays only had one cruise ship call. The peak weekday
cruise condition with two ship calls shows a slight degradation in operations during the AM peak hour
when the terminal’s trip generation is highest. Even with the peak cruise condition, all three
intersections operate within the SFRA trigger levels.

Source: Heffron Transportation, Inc. Levels of service were calculated using traffic operations models developed by SDOT for the Elliott
Avenue corridor. They reflect existing signal timing and lane geometry. All analysis was performed using the Synchro 8.0 model and analysis
methodology.
a.    Level of service threshold established by Short-Fill Redevelopment Agreement, January 2000. The SFRA included the Elliott Avenue
      W/W Galer Street intersection, which was the primary access to Terminal 91. That access has been replaced with the Galer Street
      Flyover.
b.    Level of service
c.    Average delay per vehicle in seconds.

Level of service results from Terminal 91 Monitoring Reports dating back to 2011 are compared on Figure
19 for the Elliott Avenue W/Galer Flyover intersection and on Figure 20 for the Elliott Avenue W/W
Mercer Place intersection. The charts compare the average vehicle delay without and with cruise traffic.
The condition with one cruise ship was used since that is the only condition that existed in prior years.
These show that level of service (represented by average vehicle delay) has been relatively consistent for
the past five years, and the effect of cruise operations is similar. The chart also shows the higher delay
condition that existed in 2011 at the Elliott Avenue W/W Mercer Place intersection before left turn lane
improvements were made. Those improvements lengthened the left turn lane and added vehicle detection
at the end of that lane so that the green phase for that movement is extended when longer queues exist.
Those improvements did benefit the AM peak hour conditions. The charts also show that both intersections
operate within the delay associated with the LOS E threshold established by the SFRA.

6.      CONCLUSIONS
This 2015 Terminal 91 Monitoring Study shows that truck trips continue to exceed the volume thresholds
for AM, PM and daily periods, and have exceeded those thresholds for many years. Automobile trips
exceed the thresholds during the AM and daily periods on days with cruise operations. However, despite
the fact that the traffic volume thresholds are exceeded, traffic operations along the Elliott Avenue/15th
Avenue W corridor still operate below the trigger levels at each of the study intersections during both the
AM and PM peak hours. This year’s results are very similar to results since 2010.

Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections
Levels of service (LOS) are qualitative descriptions of traffic operating conditions. These levels of ser-
vice are designated with letters ranging from LOS A, which is indicative of good operating conditions
with little or no delay, to LOS F, which is indicative of stop-and-go conditions with frequent and
lengthy delays. Levels of service for this analysis were developed using procedures presented in the
Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010).

Level of service for signalized intersections is defined by the weighted average vehicle delay of all
movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several intangible factors,
including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Level of service is typically determined for
the peak one-hour traffic volumes (for example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure
based on many variables, including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersec-
tion), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table A-1 shows the
level of service criteria for signalized intersections from the Highway Capacity Manual.
