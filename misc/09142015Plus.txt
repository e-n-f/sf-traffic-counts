    6. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE:
    Samantha Bellah, in-City resident, stated she volunteers with Rainier Foothills Wellness
    Foundation as part of the Healthy Community Coalition. She detailed an event called
    “Reality House” being held at the Fire Station on September 29th. It is designed to educate
    parents on what happens at some parties that teens attend. Teen actors will re-enact scenarios,
    there will be a wrap-up from Police and Fire Department personnel, and parents will be given
    talking points in order to have conversations with their teens about drugs and alcohol.
    Registration is now open at www.rfwellness.org or community members can call 360-802-
    3206. She cautioned that this event is meant for adults only.

    Ted DeVol, out-of-City resident but City property owner, noted that he received a letter from
    the City regarding the project on Highway 410. He contended that it doesn’t make sense to
    make all these streets and sidewalks ADA accessible when we have only a few people who
    use wheelchairs in the City. He also noted that he has not observed any bottleneck or traffic
    jam in the area that is being improved; King County Parks has purchased development rights
    east of town so there will not be more traffic from housing. This is a $2 million project and it
    does not help the bottleneck that happens every week day on Highway 410 into Buckley. He
    also expressed his displeasure at the homes being built with such small yards.

    7. PUBLIC HEARING:
    None.

    8. TABLED BUSINESS:

       C. GENERAL ITEMS
           1. Informational Reports
                a. 2015 T.I.B. Arterial Preservation Funding Application, Chris Searcy, City
                   Administrator
Searcy informed the Council that a grant application has been submitted to the Transportation
Improvement Board (TIB). It is through the Arterial Preservation Program, which is the grant
program that funded the Semanski Street Overlay. The targeted segments are on 244th:
Warner Avenue through Roosevelt; and Warner Avenue to SR 410. There is a 10% match
requirement of the approximately $593,000 project, which is $59,290.

Irwin asked if the road projects are in line with the pavement study. Searcy stated to be
eligible for the grant money, it must be an arterial street and fit within a certain pavement
criteria as it is intended to be an overlay program. The Pavement Management Program may
not indicate these as the first streets to address, however, they fit the criteria.

Carstens asked where the funds would come from for the 10% match. Searcy replied that,
although it is not yet appropriated, it could come out of Transportation Benefit District (TBD)
funds. Carstens was concerned that there would be less for the other local streets then.
Searcy concurred; however, at this point it is important to show the State the money is
available for the match. At a later time it could come out of Real Estate Excise Tax (REET)
funds or another source.

In response to a question from Overland, Searcy confirmed that the project area is entirely
within the City, no section is in the County.

LaFleur asserted that to use less than $60,000 to receive over half a million dollars of work is
a good opportunity for the City.

                b.Council Budget Priorities – Each Councilmember will have two minutes to
                  present their top three priorities on the budget
Hogan explained that it is early in the budget process and the Mayor is beginning to prepare
her draft budget. Each Councilmember is to briefly voice their budget priorities for the
Mayor to take into consideration. He cautioned Council to identify a funding source if the
item is an expenditure. The goal is not to have a debate or a long discussion; that will come
later with the Budget Workshops after the draft budget is presented.

        1. Streets - Some TBD funds are available; if the .1% ballot measure does not pass, other
           funding sources such as Public Works Trust Fund need to be identified.
        2. Quality Jobs and Quality Growth - to help cut the deficit (LATER CHANGED TO:

        1. Police – maintaining the status quo

        2. Streets
        3. Seniors

     Hogan
        1. Police – fully funding, which is a quality of life issue
        2. Draft budget that doesn’t violate current reserve policy
        3. Utility Rates – rate increases brought forward during the budget process if they are
           needed

     Sando
        1. Public Safety - Police
        2. Keep eye on expenditures (gator graph) – with the small amount of growth, the City
           needs be mindful of what expenses are increased
        3. Mayor’s Downtown Plan – if a feasibility study is done, a sensible program can be
           mapped out.

                          The City of Enumclaw’s Gallery 2015 presents:

                             Photographer: Lauri Hillberg
                               Birds of the Northwest
                                September 3, through October 6, 2015

     The City of Enumclaw and 4Culture of King County are
     excited to present Birds of the Northwest, a collection of
     unique photographs by local artist Lauri Hillberg. Lauri
     has participated in many Enumclaw art events including
     BaseCamp and Art in the Garden. Lauri also served
     several years on the Enumclaw Arts Commission. He is
     actively involved with the Arts Alive! Gallery. Lauri is
     passionate about his artwork and is always searching
     for new images. Lauri’s current collection gives our
     patrons a close-up view of the beautiful birds of the
     Northwest. Lauri Hillberg is a master at catching birds in
     just the right setting and the right position to capture
     fascinating images.

     Lauri Hillberg
      Artist Statement
     Twenty years ago when I retired from my engineering job I found myself devoting much
     of my leisure time to two of my interests: birding and photography. Living here on the
     Enumclaw Plateau has given me many opportunities to combine these interests and
     capture pictures of many of nature’s beautiful birds. Along with my digital camera I have
     spent many hours searching for the ideal photo, and with lots of patience and a great
     deal of luck I’ve had many successes.

     The major advance in bird photography for me has been the digital camera. It wasn’t
     too many years ago when we photographers would take shot after shot with a film
     camera and not soon see the results. Now pictures are immediately available, hand
     held cameras have zoom lenses approaching 100X, and thousands of images can be
     stored on a memory card. Further enhancements and innovations in digital cameras
     are certainly coming, but it’s always that particular time and place that will give that
     once-in-a lifetime bird photo.

     Gallery 2015 is located in the Council Chambers at Enumclaw City Hall. 1339 Griffin
     Ave. Enumclaw, WA 98022. Hours for the exhibition space are 9:30 a. m. to 5:00 p.m.

SUBJECT:        Sewer Volume Charge Adjustment per EMC 14.08.030(D)
                Account No: 25-7615-01 and 25-7620-00

Background:
EMC 14.08.030(D) provides for a sewer customer to appeal their bill as follows:

        D. Appeal.
        1. Should any user believe that a portion of his metered flow larger than 10 percent is
        not discharged into the sewage system, he should make written application to the
        Public Works Director for review of the user’s flow of wastewater. Should the Public
        Works Director agree that charges for the user be adjusted, he should so notify the city
        council, who may approve such change and direct a recomputation of the user’s sewer
        rates.

Non-residential sewer volume charges are based on the actual monthly water usage.

Analysis:
Staff has received a request from Emily Bort, owner of the duplex at 3336 Hansen St, to adjust the sewer
volume charges to each unit of the duplex to subtract out irrigation water consumption not entering the
wastewater system. The units are separately metered, but do not have deduct meters to measure
water used for irrigation.

for 3336 Hansen St as outlined above.

TO:             Mayor / City Council
FROM:           Scott Woodbury, P.E. / Interim Public Works Director
DATE:           September 4, 2015
SUBJECT:        Contract Acceptance –Semanski St Overlay Project 1402

Background:
On March 23, 2015, Council awarded a construction contract to Lakeridge Paving Co for the overlay of
Semanski St from SR410 to Elmont St.

Analysis:
Work began in late April 2015 and was substantially complete in early August 2015 within the allotted
contract time. The final contract amount of $583,150.34 is $23,717.94 or 4.2% over the original contract
amount of $559.432.40, primarily due to an increase in the asphalt quantity from the pavement being
slightly thicker than the minimum 2” depth specified in the contract. There were no charge orders.

Conclusion:
The project must be accepted by Council in order to close out the project and initiate the state lien filing
period. The total project cost including staff support, testing, and advertising, will be slightly less than
the original 2015 approved budget of $600,419. The majority of the project cost is funded by a state
Transportation Improvement Board fuel tax grant of nearly $504,000, with the balance funded from
Transportation Benefit District (TBD) Fund 112. Contingency REET funds of $117,981 approved by
Council on February 9 for the project were not needed and can remain in the REET accounts.

Recommendation:
Staff recommends Council accept the Lakeridge Paving Co contract as complete.

SUBJECT      2015 Second Budget Amendment

Background:
In addition to revenue and expenditure adjustments, this budget amendment also serves to roll
forward into the 2015 budget projects that were budgeted in 2014 but not yet started or completed.

Overview:
The 2015 adjusted budget reflects the continued financial struggle of balancing revenues and
expenditures. Although we are in a economic recovery, cutbacks at the State and County level
continue to put a strain on our resources. Core service areas continue to be funded and capital
funding focuses on critical projects. This ordinance includes additional changes as follows:

                                                       FINANCE DEPARTMENT


To:          Mayor Reynolds and City Council

From:        Stephanie McKenzie, Finance Director

Date:        August 24, 2014

Subject:     Contract with Dynamic Collectors, Inc.


Background:
RCW 19.16.500 allows public entities to retain collection agencies to collect public debt
and sets limits on fees to be charged. The Enumclaw Municipal Court collects
approximately 15% of receivables over the counter. The remaining amounts are turned
over to collections once they become delinquent. As of December 31, 2014 the court
receivable balance was $1,419,255.74 as reported by the State of Washington Court
System.

In December 2013 the City contracted with Merchant Credit Services (MCS) in hopes of
increasing collection rates and improving customer service. Since that time the Court
has not experienced an increase in collection rates.

Overview:
The Court would like to move one half of their receivables to Dynamic Collectors, Inc. to
determine if they would be able to generate higher returns on collections. Dynamic has
a proven track record with other cities, including neighboring Bonney Lake. In addition,
Dynamic passes through 100% of interest earned on accounts, versus 50% as paid by
MCS. If Dynamic Collectors outperforms MCS, then the court will send 100% of
collections to Dynamic and cancel the contract with MCS.

Recommendation:
Staff recommends council adopt Resolution 1543 to contract with Dynamic Collectors,
Inc for Court collection services.

                                           RESOLUTION NO. 1543


     A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY OF ENUMCLAW, KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON
     AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR COLLECTION
     SERVICES FOR THE ENUMCLAW MUNICIPAL COURT WITH DYNAMIC COLLECTORS
     INC.

            Whereas, in many occasions the fines and costs assessed by the Enumclaw Municipal

     Court are not timely paid, and

            Whereas, to collect such fines and costs the services of a collection agency are

     necessary, and

            Whereas, to maintain a viable court service it financially requires the payment of fines

     and costs, and

            Whereas, court services are of benefit to the public health, safety and welfare.



            Now, therefore, the City Council of the City of Enumclaw, King County,

     Washington do hereby resolve as follows:

            Section 1:     That the Mayor is authorized to enter into an Agreement for collection

     services for the Enumclaw Municipal Court with Dynamic Collectors, Inc, Agreement attached

     hereto and incorporated as if set out in full as Exhibit “1”.

            Section 2:      If any provision of the attached Agreements and/or this Resolution is

     determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions of the

     attached Agreements and/or this Resolution shall remain in force and effect.
