Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed expansion of the
Holiday Inn Express located at 2660 Monterey Road in San Jose, California. The project consists of the
addition of a new 81 room hotel building. The existing 57 room hotel on-site will remain. Access to the site
is and will continue to be provided via two right-turn only driveways on Monterey Road.

Scope of Study
The purpose of the study is to identify the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project. The
potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 7 signalized intersections in
the vicinity of the project site. The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated number of
project trips through the intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour). Any intersections outside of the
study area, to which the project would not add 10 or more trips per lane per hour, were not studied
because the addition of project traffic would not be a sufficient amount to result in the degradation of
intersection levels of service. The study also includes an operations analysis, based on vehicle-storage
requirements at select intersections and a review of site access and on-site circulation. It is not
anticipated that a freeway analysis would be necessary for this project. However, per CMP guidelines, the
traffic study will include an evaluation to document the determination that a freeway level of service
analysis is not required.
Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections and freeway segments were analyzed for the weekday
AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM
and the weekday PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the
most congested traffic conditions occur on a typical weekday.

Project Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development. Project trip estimates are based on trip generation rates obtained from the Institute of
Transportation Engineers’ (ITE’s) Trip Generation, Ninth Edition, 2012.
Based on the recommended ITE trip generation rates for hotel land uses, the proposed 81 room hotel
would generate 662 new daily vehicle trips, with 43 new trips (25 inbound and 18 outbound) occurring
during the AM peak hour and 49 new trips (25 inbound and 24 outbound) occurring during the PM peak
hour.

Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Table ES-1 summarizes the results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project
and background plus project conditions.
Based on level of service analysis, the project is not projected to have an adverse impact on any of the
signalized study intersections based on City of San Jose and CMP standards.

Freeway Segment Analysis
Per CMP technical guidelines, freeway segment level of service analysis shall be conducted on all
segments to which the project is projected to add one percent or more to the segment capacity. Since the
project is not projected to add one percent to any freeway segments in the area, freeway analysis for the
CMP was not required. The percentage of traffic projected to be added by the project to freeway
segments in the project area is summarized in Table ES 2.

Other Transportation Issues
Intersection Operations Analysis
Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the northbound left-turn pocket at
the Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity
under background and background plus project conditions during the AM peak hour (see Tables ES 3).
The northbound left-turn pockets currently provide approximately 475 feet of vehicle storage per lane,
which can accommodate about 19 vehicles per lane. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle queue for the
northbound left-turn movement is projected to be approximately 21 vehicles per lane during the AM peak
hour under background and background plus project conditions. The addition of project traffic at the
location would not cause the projected vehicle queues to increase beyond what is projected under
background conditions. Therefore, the addition of project traffic would not result in the need to improve
the intersection turn-pockets.
Monterey Road and Umbarger Road
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Monterey Road and Umbarger Road intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background plus project conditions
during the PM peak hours of traffic. The southbound left-turn pocket provides 200 feet of vehicle storage,
which can accommodate about 8 vehicles. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle queue for the
southbound left-turn movement is projected to be approximately 18 vehicles per lane during the PM peak
hour under background conditions. The addition of project traffic would lengthen the projected vehicle
queue by no more than one vehicle increase during the PM peak hour.
The existing southbound left-turn pocket could be extended the required 275 feet by removing the
existing median and trees along Monterey Road. Based on the southbound left-turn volume during the
PM peak hour it would be preferable to provide a second southbound left-turn lane. However, the addition
of a second southbound left-turn lane would require the acquisition of right-of-way and possible removal
of the buffered bike lane along Monterey Road.

Vehicular Site Access
The project site will continue to be served by two existing right-turn only driveways along Monterey Road.
No new access points are proposed. However, the southernmost driveway will be restricted to outbound
right-turns only. The northernmost driveway will provide both inbound and outbound access.




                                                                                           iv | Page
Monterey Road Holiday Inn Express                                                            August 6, 2015


The northernmost driveway that will provide both inbound and outbound access is shown to be 26 feet
wide. According to the City of San Jose driveway standards, standard driveways with two-way traffic
should be at least 26 feet wide and 13 feet wide for commercial developments. Therefore, the proposed
width of the project driveways would be adequate to serve the project.
Sight Distance
Adequate sight distance (sight distance triangles) should be provided at the driveway in accordance with
Caltrans standards. Sight distance triangles should be measured approximately 10 feet back from the
traveled way. Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway
or intersection, and provides drivers with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic.
Sight distance generally should be provided in accordance with Caltrans standards. The minimum
acceptable sight distance is often considered the Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance
requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. For the driveway on Monterey Road, which has a
posted speed limit of 45 mph, the Caltrans stopping sight distance is 430 feet (based on a design speed
of 50 mph). Thus, the driver must be able to see 430 feet down Monterey Road. The project driveways
should be designed to be free and clear of obstructions, thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see
pedestrians on the sidewalk and vehicles traveling on Monterey Road.

Site Circulation
The onsite circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering standards.
With the exception of the aisle serving the outbound driveway, all parking spaces within the surface and
sub-grade parking lots are shown to be 90 degree parking stalls. The City’s standard width for two-way
drive aisles is 26 feet wide where 90-degree parking is provided. The City’s standard width for one-way
drive aisles is 15 feet wide where 45-degree parking is provided. The standard aisle widths allow
sufficient room for vehicles to back out of parking spaces.
The planned width of drive aisles within the parking lots are 26 feet wide for two-way drive aisles and 15
feet wide for the outbound drive aisle serving the outbound only driveway. Therefore, the proposed aisle
widths on the project site would meet City standards.
The site layout provides for continuous circulation through the parking areas on-site with no dead-end
aisles. However, the one-way outbound only drive aisle will require that vehicles circulating the site not
wishing to exit the site, possibly in search of available parking, to exit to Monterey Road and re-enter the
site. It is recommended that signage be placed at the entrance to the outbound driveway aisle warning
drivers that the aisle provides exit to Monterey Road only.

Overall, the site plan exhibits adequate site access and on-site circulation for motor vehicles. The City
ultimately will determine the adequacy of the proposed driveways and internal on-site circulation design.

Truck and Emergency Vehicle Access
Corner radii and aisle widths within the site appear to be sufficient to allow for the circulation of large
design vehicles such as garbage trucks and fire trucks. Based on the site plan, garbage pick-up would
occur at the rear, southeast corner, of the site along the on-site drive aisle. Larger vehicles will have the
ability to enter from the northern most driveway serving the on-site drive aisle and exit via the outbound
only driveway without the need to turn around (perform U-turns) on site. With the proposed internal
roadway layout and adhering to City design standards and guidelines, emergency vehicle access and
circulation within the project site should be adequate.


Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist of sidewalks and crosswalks along the streets and intersections in the
immediate vicinity of the project site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are
located at all of the signalized intersections in the study area. Overall, the existing network of sidewalks



                                                                                                 v | Page
Monterey Road Holiday Inn Express                                                        August 6, 2015


exhibits good connectivity and would provide new hotel guests with safe routes to transit services and
other points of interest in the area.
Per the City of San Jose Municipal Code (Chapter 20.90.060) hotel land uses are required to provide one
space per ten hotel rooms. Based on the City’s parking requirements, the proposed hotel is required to
provide 8 bicycle parking spaces. The site plan shows 10 bicycle parking spaces on the south side of the
project. Therefore, the proposed bicycle parking will meet the City’s parking requirements.

Transit Services
The project site is located between two major transit opportunities. The Curtner LRT station is located
along SR 87 approximately 1.6 miles from the project site and the Capitol Caltrain station is located at the
intersection of Monterey Road and Fehren Drive approximately 1 mile from the project site. In addition,
the project site is served directly by local bus services along Monterey Road. The nearest bus stops are
located near the intersection of Monterey Road and Umbarger Road.

Parking
Per the City of San Jose Municipal Code (Chapter 20.90.060) hotel land uses are required to provide one
space per hotel room or suite plus one space per employee. Based on the City’s parking requirements
and the assumption that the proposed hotel may have up to 10 employees on site at any given time, the
project is required to provide a total of 148 off-street parking spaces to serve both the existing 57 hotel
rooms and proposed additional 81 rooms. The project proposes 148 on-site parking spaces. Therefore,
the proposed parking provided on-site will meet the City’s parking requirements.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed expansion of the
Holiday Inn Express located at 2660 Monterey Road in San Jose, California. The project consists of the
addition of a new 81 room hotel building. The existing 57 room hotel on-site will remain. Access to the site
is and will continue to be provided via two right-turn only driveways along Monterey Road. The project site
location and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The project site plan is shown on Figure
2.

Scope of Study
The purpose of the study is to identify the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project. The
potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 7 signalized intersections
within the City of San Jose. The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated number of
project trips through the intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour). Any intersections outside of the
study area, to which the project would not add 10 or more trips per lane per hour, were not studied
because the addition of project traffic would not be a sufficient amount to result in the degradation of
intersection levels of service. The study also includes an operations analysis, based on vehicle-storage
requirements at select intersections and a review of site access and on-site circulation. An analysis of
freeway segments was not performed because the proposed project would not add traffic equal to at least
one percent of capacity of any freeway segment. The study intersections are identified below.

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of
adjacent street traffic. The AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM,
and the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these
periods on an average weekday that the most congested traffic conditions occur.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
    Scenario 1:   Existing Conditions. Existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes were obtained from
                  the City of San Jose and supplemented with new manual turning-movement counts
                  conducted in March 2015.
    Scenario 2:   Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes were
                  estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                  project. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                  order to determine the effects the project would have on existing roadway network.
    Scenario 3:   Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                  existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
                  developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet completed developments
                  was provided by the City of San Jose in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI).
                  Background conditions represent the baseline conditions to which project conditions are
                  compared for the purpose of determining project impacts.
    Scenario 4:   Background Plus Project Conditions. Projected near-term peak hour traffic volumes with
                  the project were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the additional traffic
                  generated by the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
                  background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts according to the
                  City of San Jose Level of Service Policy.

Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from previous traffic studies, new traffic counts, the City
of San Jose, the CMP Annual Monitoring Report, and field observations. The following data were
collected from these sources:

   existing traffic volumes
   intersection lane configurations
   signal timing and phasing
   a list of approved and planned project trips

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are
described below.

City of San Jose Intersections
The City of San Jose level of service methodology for signalized intersections is the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) method. This method is applied using the TRAFFIX software. The 2000 HCM
operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time

                                                                                                4 | Page

for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersection level of service
methodology, the City of San Jose methodology employs the CMP default values for the analysis
parameters. The City of San Jose level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS D or better.
The correlation between average control delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.

              and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures begin to
              appear.
     D        Operations with longer delays due to a combination of unfavorable                    35.1 to 55.0
              progression, long cycle lengths, or high V/C ratios. Many vehicles
              stop and individual cycle failures are noticeable.
      E       Operations with high delay values indicating poor progression, long                  55.1 to 80.0
              cycle lengths, and high V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures are
               frequent occurrences. This is considered to be the limit of
              acceptable delay.
      F       Operation with delays unacceptable to most drivers occurring due                   Greater than 80.0
              to oversaturation, poor progression, or very long cycle lengths.

CMP Signalized Intersections
Since TRAFFIX is the designated level of service methodology for both the CMP and the City of San
Jose, the CMP study intersections are not analyzed separately, but rather are among the City of San
Jose signalized intersections analyzed using TRAFFIX. The only difference between the San Jose and
CMP analyses is that project impacts are determined on the basis of different level of service standards –
the CMP level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS E or better. However, the City of
San Jose LOS D standard and impact criteria is applied to CMP intersections located within City of San
Jose limits.

Intersection Operations
The analysis of intersection level of service is often supplemented with an analysis of intersection
operations for selected intersections where the project would add a significant number of left-turning
vehicles. The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand turning-movements at
intersections. Vehicle queues are estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the
probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
                                           n    – (
                    P (x=n) =             e
                                           n!
          where:
                    P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
                                                                                                        5 | Page

                n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane

The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-
turn storage requirements at signalized intersections.

would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue length larger than the 95 percentile queue
would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a

length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95 percentile
queue length is also known as the “design queue length.”

SR 87 is a six-lane freeway that is aligned in a north-south orientation. SR 87 begins at its interchange
with SR 85 and extends northward to US 101. Access to the project site is provided by ramps at Capitol
Expressway/Narvaez Avenue and Curtner Avenue.
US 101 is an eight-lane freeway (three mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane in each direction) in the
vicinity of the site. US 101 extends northward through San Francisco and southward through Gilroy.
Access to and from the site is provided via full interchanges at Capitol Expressway, Tully Road, and SR
85.
Interstate-280 connects from US 101 in San Jose to I-80 in San Francisco. It is generally an eight-lane
freeway in the vicinity of downtown San Jose. It also has auxiliary lanes between some interchanges. The
section of I-280 just north of the Bascom Avenue overcrossing has six mixed-flow lanes and two high-
occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lanes. I-280 provides access to the project area via its interchanges with SR 87
and US 101.
Interstate-680 is a 8-lane freeway that extends north from its transition from I-280 near US 101 through
Milpitas. Access to the project area is provided indirectly via its transition to I-280 near US 101.
Local access to the site is provided by Monterey Road (SR 82), Curtner Avenue, Capitol Expressway,
and Almaden Expressway. These roadways are described below.
Monterey Road (SR 82) is a six-lane major arterial that is oriented in a north-south direction. Monterey
Road extends southward into Morgan Hill and northward into San Francisco. Direct access to the site is
provided via two driveways on Monterey Road.
Curtner Avenue is an east-west arterial street extending from Camden Avenue near SR 17 to Tully Road
just east of Monterey Road. Curtner Avenue is generally four lanes, however it widens to six lanes at
Communications Hill Boulevard. Tully Road is six lanes wide and provides access to US 101. Curtner
Avenue provides access to SR 87 and the project site via its intersection with Monterey Road.

Capitol Expressway is a six-lane major arterial that is aligned in an east-west orientation. Capitol
Expressway begins at its interchange with I-680 in east San Jose, where it changes designation from San
Antonio Street, and extends to the south and west where it changes designation to Hillsdale Avenue at
Almaden Expressway. Access to the site is provided via Monterey Road.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Bicycle facilities are divided into three classes of relative significance. Class I bikeways are bike paths
that are physically separated from motor vehicles and offer two-way bicycle travel on a separate path.
Class II bikeways are striped bike lanes on roadways that are marked by signage and pavement
markings. Class III bikeways are bike routes and only have signs to help guide bicyclists on
recommended routes to certain locations. The locations of existing bicycle facilities are show on Figure 3.
Currently, class II bike lanes are provided on the following roadway segments:
       Cherry Avenue between Curtner Avenue and Almaden Expressway (2.50 Miles)
       Curtner Avenue/Tully Road between Quimby Road and Leigh Avenue (6.8 Miles)
       Little Orchard Street between San Jose Avenue and Curtner Avenue (0.75 Mile)
       Monterey Road between Metcalf Road and Curtner Avenue (8.0 Miles)
       Narvaez Avenue between Hillsdale Avenue and Branham Lane (1.2 Miles)
       Vistapark Drive between Capitol Expressway and Hyde Park Drive (0.75 Mile)
       Snell Avenue between Hillsdale Avenue and Curie Drive (4.0 Miles)
       Pearl Avenue between Capitol Expressway and Branham Lane (0.70 Mile)
       Branham Lane between Cherry Avenue and Monterey Road (3.60 Miles)
       Senter Road, between Keyes Street and south of Capitol Expressway (2.85 Miles)
       Seventh Street, between San Jose State University and Curtner Avenue (2.5 Miles)

Adjacent to SR 87 is a City of San Jose and Santa Clara County Class I bicycle facility (off-street bike
path) that runs between Willow Street and Curtner Avenue, and continues southward to connect to the
bicycle lane on Narvaez Avenue. This path accesses the Tamien Caltrain/Light Rail station, located just
north of Alma Avenue, and the Curtner Light Rail station to the south. Bike lockers and bike racks are
provided at the Curtner, Capitol, and Tamien LRT stations. These bike paths are also available for use by
pedestrians.
Pedestrian facilities in the project area consist primarily of sidewalks along the streets in most residential
and commercial areas, as well as the aforementioned bike/pedestrian path. Sidewalks are found along
virtually all previously described local roadways in the study area.

Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the VTA and Caltrain. The existing transit services
are described below and shown on Figure 4.

VTA Transit Service
Bus Service
The project site is served by four VTA bus lines. The closest bus stops are located near the intersections
of Monterey Road and Umbarger Road. The bus lines provide connections to other bus lines that serve
the greater project area.
Local Route 26 provides service between the Eastridge Transit Center and the Sunnyvale/Lockheed
Martin Transit Center. Route 26 operates along Curtner Avenue and Tully Road in the project study area,
with 30-minute headways during the weekday peak commute hours and 30-minute headways during
most of the day on weekends. Bus stops for Route 26 are located approximately one mile from the project
site and are situated on the north side of Tully Road just east of Monterey Road, and on the south side of
                                                                                            8 | Page

Tully Road just east of 7th Street.

Local Route 66 provides service between Kaiser Hospital and Dixon Landing Road in Milpitas. Route 66
operates along Monterey Road in the project study area, with 15-minute headways during the weekday
peak commute hours and 30-minute headways during most of the day on weekends.
Local Route 68 provides service between the San Jose Diridon Station and Gavilan College in Gilroy.
Route 68 operates along Monterey Road in the project study area, with 15- to 30-minute headways during
the weekday peak commute hours and 30-minute headways during most of the day on weekends.
Limited Stop Route 304 provides service between the Santa Teresa LRT station and the Sunnyvale
transit center, with stops in downtown San Jose. It operates along Monterey Highway in the project study
area. Limited Stop Route 304 operates on 30-minute headways during the weekday peak commute hours
and does not operate on weekends.
Light Rail Transit (LRT) Service
The nearest LRT station is located approximately 1.6 miles from the project site. The Curtner LRT station
is located at the Curtner Avenue and Canoas Garden Avenue intersection and provides a direct
connection to VTA bus service (Local Route 26). The Curtner LRT station offers bicycle lockers, a Park &
Ride lot, and long-term airport parking.
LRT service at the Curtner LRT station is provided by the Alum Rock-Santa Teresa LRT line, which
operates nearly 24 hours a day (4:00 AM to 1:00 AM) with 10-15-minute headways during peak commute
and midday hours. The Alum Rock-Santa Teresa LRT line provides service from the Santa Teresa station
in south San Jose, through downtown San Jose to north San Jose where it curves east and operates
along the Tasman Corridor, bends south and runs along the Capitol Corridor, and ultimately terminates in
east San Jose just south of Alum Rock Avenue.

Caltrain
Caltrain operates a commuter rail service seven days a week between the Diridon Station in San Jose
and San Francisco. During weekday commuting hours, Caltrain also serves south San Jose and the
south county including Gilroy, San Martin, and Morgan Hill.
The Capitol Caltrain station is located at the intersection of Monterey Road and Fehren Drive, just 1 mile
from the project site. Caltrain provides weekday commute service to the Capitol Caltrain station with three
northbound trains during the AM peak commute hour and three southbound trains during the PM peak
commute hours. The Capitol Caltrain station offers a 379-space parking lot and a direct connection to
VTA bus routes (Local Routes 66 and 68, and Express Route 304).

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were provided by city staff and confirmed by
observations in the field. The existing intersection lane configurations are shown on Figure 5.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing peak-hour traffic volumes were obtained from the City of San Jose TRAFFIX database and new
intersection turn-movement counts (conducted in March 2015). The existing peak-hour intersection
volumes are shown on Figure 6. Intersection turning-movement counts conducted for this analysis are
presented in Appendix A.

City of San Jose Intersections
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of
service policy, the study intersection of Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue currently operates at an
unacceptable LOS E during the PM peak hour.
The remaining study intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM
and PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersections
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against CMP standards, all of the CMP
intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions were observed in the field to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic
problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the
level of service analysis does not accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.

AM and PM field observations revealed that overall the study intersections operate well, and the level of
service calculations accurately reflect existing conditions.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes existing traffic conditions with the addition of the traffic that would be generated by
the proposed project. Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially exist if the project was
constructed and occupied prior to the other approved projects in the area. It is unlikely that this traffic
condition would occur, since other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely
be built and occupied during the time the project is going through the development review and
construction process. This scenario describes a less congested traffic condition, since it ignores any
potential traffic from prior approvals. Existing plus project conditions also does not include any planned
and funded roadway improvements that have not been constructed.

Transportation Network Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions would
be the same as the existing transportation network.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets. These procedures are described further in the following sections.

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development. Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed project based on trip
generation rates obtained from the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE’s) Trip Generation Manual,
Ninth Edition, 2012.
Based on the recommended ITE trip generation rates for hotel land uses, the proposed 81 room hotel
would generate 662 new daily vehicle trips, with 43 new trips (25 inbound and 18 outbound) occurring
during the AM peak hour and 49 new trips (25 inbound and 24 outbound) occurring during the PM peak
hour. The project trip generation estimates are presented in Table 3.

Trip Distribution Pattern and Trip Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the project was developed based on existing travel patterns on the
surrounding roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. The peak hour vehicle trips
generated by the project were assigned to the roadway network in accordance with the trip distribution
pattern. Figure 7 shows the project trip distribution pattern. Figure 8 shows the project trip assignment. A
tabular summary of project traffic at each study intersection is contained in Appendix C.

Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The project trips, as represented in the project trip assignment discussed above, were added to existing
traffic volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes. The existing plus project traffic volumes are
presented in Figure 9. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. The results of
the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are summarized in Table 4.

City of San Jose Intersections
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of
service policy, the intersection of Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue is projected to operate at an
unacceptable LOS E during the PM peak hour under existing plus project conditions.
The remaining study intersections operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM and PM
peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersections
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against CMP standards, all of the CMP
intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed project. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise volumes from
existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in the vicinity of the site.
This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes and the resulting
traffic conditions. The background scenario predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as
approved development gets built and occupied.

Background Transportation Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would be the
same as the existing transportation network with the exception of the following improvements planned as
part of other development or Capital Improvement Projects:
Stone Avenue/Communications Hill Boulevard and Curtner Avenue – The planned improvement consists
of the addition of a second westbound left-turn lane from Curtner Avenue to Communications Hill
Boulevard. The improvement is to be completed with the approved Communications Hill residential
development.

Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak hour volumes the
estimated traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments. The added traffic from approved
but not yet constructed developments in the City of San Jose was obtained from the City’s Approved
Trips Inventory (ATI).
Background traffic volumes are shown graphically on Figure 10. The ATI is contained in Appendix B.
Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Background Conditions
Intersection levels of service under background conditions were evaluated against City of San Jose and
CMP standards. The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are
shown in Table 5.

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of service policy, the following three
signalized study intersections are projected to operate at an unacceptable LOS E or worse during the PM
peak hours under background conditions:


                          1     Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue*

                          6     Stone Avenue/Communications Hill Boulevard and Curtner Avenue

One of the three intersections is CMP designated intersection. All other study intersections are projected
to operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against CMP standards, the intersection
of Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue is projected to operate at an unacceptable LOS F conditions
during the PM peak hour under background conditions.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Background Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes near-term traffic conditions that most likely would occur when the project is
complete. It includes a description of the City of San Jose significance criteria used to establish what
constitutes a project impact, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts caused by
the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order
to determine potential project impacts. This traffic scenario represents a more congested traffic condition
than the existing plus project scenario, since it includes traffic generated by approved but not yet built
projects in the area.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used
to determine significant impacts on signalized intersections are based on City of San Jose Level of
Service standards. The City of San Jose LOS Policy is the adopted established threshold for CEQA.
Project impacts also were analyzed according to the County Congestion Management Program (CMP)
methodology for the two CMP study intersections.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of San Jose if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project conditions,
       or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by one percent (.01) or more, or
An exception to rule #2 above applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.




                                                                                              25 | Page

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San Jose, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better. A
significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection conditions to background conditions or better.

Transportation Network Under Background Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under project conditions would be the same
as described under background conditions.

Project Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignments
The project trip generation, distributions, and assignments under background plus project conditions
would be identical to those presented in Chapter 3 for existing plus project conditions.

Background Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The project trips were added to background traffic volumes to obtain background plus project traffic
volumes. The background plus project traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown graphically on
Figure 11. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection LOS Under Background Plus Project Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against the City of San Jose Level of Service Policy. The
results of the level of service analysis under background plus project conditions are summarized in Table
6.

City of San Jose Intersections
The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of service policy, the following three
signalized study intersections are projected to operate at an unacceptable LOS E or worse during the PM
peak hour under background plus project conditions:
                           1    Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue*
                           5    SR-87 and Curtner Avenue (E)
                           6    Stone Avenue/Communications Hill Boulevard and Curtner Avenue

Based on the City of San Jose significance criteria none of the above-identified intersections would be
significantly impacted by the project.
All other study intersections are projected to operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM
and PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against CMP standards, the intersection
of Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue is projected to operate at an acceptable LOS F during the PM
peak hour under background plus project conditions. Based on the CMP significance criteria the addition
of project traffic will not result in an impact at the Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue intersection.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
Per CMP technical guidelines, freeway segment level of service analysis shall be conducted on all
segments to which the project is projected to add one percent or more to the segment capacity. Since the
project is not projected to add one percent to any freeway segments in the area, freeway analysis for the
CMP was not required. The percentage of traffic projected to be added by the project to freeway
segments in the project area is summarized in Table 7.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project, including:
        Intersection operations analysis – vehicle queuing and storage at selected intersections
        Potential project impacts to transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities
        Site access and on-site circulation

Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this
chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by
the traffic engineering community.

Intersection Operations Analysis
The analysis of intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of left-turn pocket storage
and vehicle queuing for intersections where the project would add a significant number of left turns.
Accordingly, not all of the study intersections were evaluated for left-turn vehicle queues. The operations
analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high demand turning movements at intersections. Vehicle
queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of “n”
vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
                          n   – (
         P (x=n) =        e
                           n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Average # of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)
                                                                                                           th
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned available storage
capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-turn storage
                                                  th
requirements at signalized intersections. The 95 percentile queue length value indicates that during the
peak hour, a queue of this length or less would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue
                         th
length larger than the 95 percentile queue would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3
cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a 60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-turn storage
                                 th
pocket designs based on the 95 percentile queue length would ensure that storage space would be
                                               th
exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95 percentile queue length is also known as the “design queue
length.” The vehicle queue estimates and a tabulated summary of the findings are provided in Table 8.

Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the northbound left-turn pocket at
the Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity
under background and background plus project conditions during the AM peak hour.
The northbound left-turn pockets currently provide approximately 475 feet of vehicle storage per lane,
which can accommodate about 19 vehicles per lane. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle queue for the
northbound left-turn movement is projected to be approximately 21 vehicles per lane during the AM peak

                                                                                                 31 | Page

hour under background and background plus project conditions. The addition of project traffic at the
location would not cause the projected vehicle queues to increase beyond what is projected under
background conditions. Therefore, the addition of project traffic would not result in the need to improve
the intersection turn-pockets.

Monterey Road and Umbarger Road
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Monterey Road and Umbarger Road intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background plus project conditions
during the PM peak hours of traffic. The southbound left-turn pocket provides 200 feet of vehicle storage,
which can accommodate about 8 vehicles. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle queue for the
southbound left-turn movement is projected to be approximately 18 vehicles per lane during the PM peak
hour under background conditions. The addition of project traffic would lengthen the projected vehicle
queue by no more than one vehicle during the PM peak hour.
The existing southbound left-turn pocket could be extended the required 275 feet by removing the
existing median and trees along Monterey Road. Based on the southbound left-turn volume during the
PM peak hour it would be preferable to provide a second southbound left-turn lane. However, the addition
of a second southbound left-turn lane would require the acquisition of right-of-way and possible removal
of the buffered bike lane along Monterey Road.

Site Access and Circulation
The site access and circulation evaluation is based on the site plan prepared by Lee Gage & Associates,
Inc. (Figure 2). On-site vehicular circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic
engineering standards. The sub-grade parking layout is shown in Figure 12.

Vehicular Site Access
The project site will continue to be served by two existing right-turn only driveways along Monterey Road.
No new access points are proposed. However, the southernmost driveway will be restricted to outbound
right-turns only. The northernmost driveway will provide both inbound and outbound access. Projected
project trips at each of the project driveways are shown in Figure 13.
The northernmost driveway that will provide both inbound and outbound access is shown to be 26 feet
wide. According to the City of San Jose driveway standards, standard driveways with two-way traffic
should be at least 26 feet wide and 13 feet wide for commercial developments. Therefore, the proposed
width of the project driveways would be adequate to serve the project.
Sight Distance
Adequate sight distance (sight distance triangles) should be provided at the driveway in accordance with
Caltrans standards. Sight distance triangles should be measured approximately 10 feet back from the
traveled way. Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway
or intersection, and provides drivers with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic.
Sight distance generally should be provided in accordance with Caltrans standards. The minimum
acceptable sight distance is often considered the Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance
requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. For the driveway on Monterey Road, which has a
posted speed limit of 45 mph, the Caltrans stopping sight distance is 430 feet (based on a design speed
of 50 mph). Thus, the driver must be able to see 430 feet down Monterey Road. The project driveways
should be designed to be free and clear of obstructions, thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see
pedestrians on the sidewalk and vehicles traveling on Monterey Road.

Site Circulation
The onsite circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering standards.
With the exception of the aisle serving the outbound driveway, all parking spaces within the surface and
sub-grade parking lots are shown to be 90 degree parking stalls. The City’s standard width for two-way

sufficient room for vehicles to back out of parking spaces.
The planned width of drive aisles within the parking lots are 26 feet wide for two-way drive aisles and 15
feet wide for the outbound drive aisle serving the outbound only driveway. Therefore, the proposed aisle
widths on the project site would meet City standards.
The site layout provides for continuous circulation through the parking areas on-site with no dead-end
aisles. However, the one-way outbound only drive aisle will require that vehicles circulating the site not
wishing to exit the site, possibly in search of available parking, to exit to Monterey Road and re-enter the
site. It is recommended that signage be placed at the entrance to the outbound driveway aisle warning
drivers that the aisle provides exit to Monterey Road only.

Overall, the site plan exhibits adequate site access and on-site circulation for motor vehicles. The City
ultimately will determine the adequacy of the proposed driveways and internal on-site circulation design.

Truck and Emergency Vehicle Access
Corner radii and aisle widths within the site appear to be sufficient to allow for the circulation of large
design vehicles such as garbage trucks and fire trucks. Based on the site plan, garbage pick-up would
occur at the rear, southeast corner, of the site along the on-site drive aisle. Larger vehicles will have the
ability to enter from the northern most driveway serving the on-site drive aisle and exit via the outbound
only driveway without the need to turn around (perform U-turns) on site. With the proposed internal
roadway layout and adhering to City design standards and guidelines, emergency vehicle access and
circulation within the project site should be adequate.


Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist of sidewalks and crosswalks along the streets and intersections in the
immediate vicinity of the project site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are
located at all of the signalized intersections in the study area. Overall, the existing network of sidewalks
exhibits good connectivity and would provide new hotel guests with safe routes to transit services and
other points of interest in the area.
Per the City of San Jose Municipal Code (Chapter 20.90.060) hotel land uses are required to provide one
bicycle parking space per ten hotel rooms. Based on the City’s parking requirements, the proposed hotel
is required to provide 8 bicycle parking spaces. The site plan shows 10 bicycle parking spaces on the
south side of the project. Therefore, the proposed bicycle parking will meet the City’s parking
requirements.

Transit Services
The project site is located between two major transit opportunities. The Curtner LRT station is located
along SR 87 approximately 1.6 miles from the project site and the Capitol Caltrain station is located at the
intersection of Monterey Road and Fehren Drive approximately 1 mile from the project site. In addition,
the project site is served directly by local bus services along Monterey Road. The nearest bus stops are
located near the intersection of Monterey Road and Umbarger Road.

Parking
Per the City of San Jose Municipal Code (Chapter 20.90.060) hotel land uses are required to provide one
space per hotel room or suite plus one space per employee. Based on the City’s parking requirements
and the assumption that the proposed hotel may have up to 10 employees on site at any given time, the
project is required to provide a total of 148 off-street parking spaces to serve both the existing 57 hotel
rooms and proposed additional 81 rooms. The project proposes 148 on-site parking spaces. Therefore,
the proposed parking provided on-site will meet the City’s parking requirements.

Conclusions
The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the City
of San Jose and the Congestion Management Program (CMP) of Santa Clara County. The study included
the analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions for seven intersections. Project impacts on other
transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit services, were determined on the basis of
engineering judgment.

Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Based on level of service analysis, the project is not projected to have an adverse impact on any of the
signalized study intersections based on City of San Jose and CMP standards.

Freeway Segment Analysis
Per CMP technical guidelines, freeway segment level of service analysis shall be conducted on all
segments to which the project is projected to add one percent or more to the segment capacity. Since the
project is not projected to add one percent to any freeway segments in the area, freeway analysis for the
CMP was not required. The percentage of traffic projected to be added by the project to freeway
segments in the project area is summarized in Table ES 2.

Other Transportation Issues
Intersection Operations Analysis
Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the northbound left-turn pocket at
the Monterey Road and Curtner Avenue intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity
under background and background plus project conditions during the AM peak hour (see Tables ES 3).
The northbound left-turn pockets currently provide approximately 475 feet of vehicle storage per lane,
which can accommodate about 19 vehicles per lane. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle queue for the
northbound left-turn movement is projected to be approximately 21 vehicles per lane during the AM peak
hour under background and background plus project conditions. The addition of project traffic at the
location would not cause the projected vehicle queues to increase beyond what is projected under
background conditions. Therefore, the addition of project traffic would not result in the need to improve
the intersection turn-pockets.

Monterey Road and Umbarger Road
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Monterey Road and Umbarger Road intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background plus project conditions
during the PM peak hours of traffic. The southbound left-turn pocket provides 200 feet of vehicle storage,
which can accommodate about 8 vehicles. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle queue for the
southbound left-turn movement is projected to be approximately 18 vehicles per lane during the PM peak
hour under background conditions. The addition of project traffic would lengthen the projected vehicle

The existing southbound left-turn pocket could be extended the required 275 feet by removing the

Vehicular Site Access
The site access and circulation evaluation is based on the site plan prepared by Lee Gage & Associates,
Inc. and in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering standards.
The project site will continue to be served by two existing right-turn only driveways along Monterey Road.
No new access points are proposed. However, the southernmost driveway will be restricted to outbound
right-turns only. The northernmost driveway will provide both inbound and outbound access.
The northernmost driveway that will provide both inbound and outbound access is shown to be 26 feet
wide. According to the City of San Jose driveway standards, standard driveways with two-way traffic
should be at least 26 feet wide and 13 feet wide for commercial developments. Therefore, the proposed
width of the project driveways would be adequate to serve the project.
Sight Distance
Adequate sight distance (sight distance triangles) should be provided at the driveway in accordance with
Caltrans standards. Sight distance triangles should be measured approximately 10 feet back from the
traveled way. Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway
or intersection, and provides drivers with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic.

should be designed to be free and clear of obstructions, thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see
pedestrians on the sidewalk and vehicles traveling on Monterey Road.

Site Circulation
The onsite circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering standards.
With the exception of the aisle serving the outbound driveway, all parking spaces within the surface and
sub-grade parking lots are shown to be 90 degree parking stalls. The City’s standard width for two-way
drive aisles is 26 feet wide where 90-degree parking is provided. The City’s standard width for one-way
drive aisles is 15 feet wide where 45-degree parking is provided. The standard aisle widths allow
sufficient room for vehicles to back out of parking spaces.
The planned width of drive aisles within the parking lots are 26 feet wide for two-way drive aisles and 15
feet wide for the outbound drive aisle serving the outbound only driveway. Therefore, the proposed aisle
widths on the project site would meet City standards.
