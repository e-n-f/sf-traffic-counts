Transportation Technical Report




1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the transportation impact analysis for the proposed replacement of Northwood
Elementary School at its existing site located at 9805-24th Street E in Edgewood. It includes a
description of existing and proposed conditions in the site vicinity, projected trip generation and
distribution patterns, operational analysis at the project study area intersections, and an assessment of
the project’s impacts to safety, transit service, and non-motorized facilities.

The elements and organization of this analysis follow the City of Edgewood’s (City’s) Traffic Impact
Analysis Guidelines.1 The study area for the analysis was defined by City review staff 2 and its
transportation review consultant3 based on preliminary scoping analyses prepared by Heffron
Transportation.4 An analysis scoping meeting was held at the City on Thursday, November 10, 2016. The
study area was identified based on the trip generation, distribution patterns, and assignments presented in
that analysis. The school’s morning arrival peak hour occurs between 8:00 and 9:00 A.M. and the
afternoon dismissal peak hour occurs between 2:45 and 3:45 P.M. The project is expected to generate
relatively little new traffic during the commuter PM peak hour (typically the highest hour between 4:00
and 6:00 P.M.) and, based on direction from the City, was not included in the analysis. The four off-site
study area intersections and the corresponding analysis periods are listed below:

                 Meridian Avenue E/8th Street E – morning peak hour
                 Meridian Avenue E/16th Street E – morning and afternoon peak hours
                 Meridian Avenue E/24th Street E – morning and afternoon peak hours
                 94th Avenue E/24th Street E – morning and afternoon peak hours


1.1. Project Description
The school serves kindergarten through sixth grade (K-6) and consists of the main school building
(30,400 square feet (sf)5) and six classrooms in portable buildings with capacity for 436 students.6
Existing enrollment (as of fall 2016) was reported at 429 students7 and the school currently has 36 staff.8
The school site is located west of Meridian Avenue E and north of 24th Street E. The site location and
vicinity are shown on Figure 1.

The Northwood Elementary School site has hard and soft surface play areas and a grass play field.
There is on-site parking with 59 striped stalls in the main lot for staff and parents/visitors. There are also
seven spaces located behind the school building to the north. The school access is located on 24th Street
E. The driveway extends 390 feet, then divides and loops around the main parking lot. The loop
operates with a one-way circulation pattern for staff/visitors and school buses. School bus load/unload
occurs in the front of the school just north of the parking lot.

Transportation Technical Report

The project would remove the existing structures and parking on the site and construct a new elementary
school with approximately 80,600 sf and capacity for up to 730 students. The proposed site plan is
shown on Figure 2. As shown, the new school is proposed to have two access driveways on 24th Street
E. The school bus load/unload area, staff parking (for 37 vehicles), and day-care van/shuttle load/unload
would be accessed from the site’s western driveway (along the western edge) at the location of the
existing access driveway. The main parking lot (for 60 vehicles) and the passenger vehicle load/unload
area would be accessed from a new east access driveway (located approximately 330 feet east of the
west driveway). The proposal also includes 13 auxiliary parking spaces on the east side of the main
access driveway near the athletic field, bringing the total proposed parking capacity to 110 spaces.



2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This section describes the existing roadway network, traffic volumes, traffic operations (in terms of
levels of service), traffic safety, transit facilities, non-motorized facilities, and parking.

2.1. Roadway Network
The City designates streets as principal arterials, minor arterials, collectors, and local access streets
depending upon the street’s function in the roadway network.9 The key roadways in the vicinity of the
project site are described below.

Meridian Avenue E (State Route [SR] 161) is a north-south Principal Arterial that connects between
Interstate-5 and SR 18 to the north, and SR 167 and SR 512 to the south. North of 24th Street E, it is
generally a five-lane roadway with two travel lanes in each direction and a center two-way left-turn lane.
South of 24th Street E, Meridian Avenue E is a three-lane roadway with two travel lanes in each direction
and a center two-way left-turn lane. In the vicinity of the site, the roadway has curbs, gutters, and
sidewalks on both sides and has a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour (mph). There are also 4-foot
wide shoulders provided for bicycles on both sides of the roadway and on-street parking is not permitted.
Its intersections with 8th Street E, 16th Street E, and 24th Street E are signalized with crosswalks on all
legs. A mid-block signed and marked crosswalk is located just south of 18th Street Court E.

24th Street E is a two-lane, east-west roadway that provides connection between 125th Avenue Court E
to the east and 92nd Avenue E to the west. It is classified as a Minor Arterial to the west of 122nd Avenue
E and as a local access street to the east. In the vicinity of the project site, there are generally paved
and/or gravel-grass shoulders that vary in width but are typically narrower than three feet. Recent
frontage improvements for a residential development directly west of the project site included sidewalk
and an eight-foot wide paved shoulder. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 35 mph. A school-zone
speed limit (20 mph) is signed near the school and is in effect when beacons are flashing or when
children are present. A school crossing of 24th Street E is signed without pavement markings on the west
site of the school access. There are no signs prohibiting on-street parking; during field observations of
the afternoon school dismissal peak hour, no on-street parking was observed in the vicinity of the site.

Transportation Technical Report

16th Street E is a two-lane, east-west Collector Arterial that provides a connection between Meridian
Avenue E and 112th Avenue E to the east. West of Meridian Avenue E, the roadway is known as Taylor
Street. Except for a short segment, the roadway west of Meridian Avenue E is outside the city limits and
is designated as a Pierce County Collector Arterial. The roadway has mostly grass/gravel shoulders, but
there are intermittent sections with no shoulder. There is a 530-foot segment of sidewalk on the south
side of the street that extends from Meridian Avenue E to 100th Avenue Court E. East of its intersection
with Meridian Avenue E, it has a posted speed limit of 35 mph; west of Meridian Avenue E, it has a
posted speed limit of 25 mph. There are no signs prohibiting on-street parking; during field observations
of the afternoon school dismissal peak hour, no on-street parking was observed in the vicinity of the
site.

8th Street E is an east-west Minor Arterial that provides a connection between Meridian Avenue E and
122nd Avenue E to the east. West of Meridian Avenue E, the roadway is outside the city limits and is
designated as a Pierce County Minor Arterial. The roadway has one travel lane in each direction with
paved/grass-gravel shoulders. It has a posted speed limit of 35 mph. On-street parking is not permitted on
either side of the roadway.

94th Avenue E is a two-lane, north-south Collector Arterial that provides a connection between 24th Street
E on the north and 32nd Street E on the south. There are shoulders on both sides are a mix of paved, grass,
and gravel. Along some segments of the roadway, the shoulders are over seven feet in width and are used
for parking. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 25 mph.



2.2. Traffic Volumes
Classes at the existing Northwood Elementary School start at 8:55 A.M. and are dismissed at 3:16 P.M. To
evaluate the potential traffic conditions in the study area during times when the school generates its
highest traffic volumes (the morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hours), new peak period turning
movement traffic counts were performed at all four study area intersections as well as the existing site
access driveway. Morning arrival peak period traffic counts were conducted at all study area intersections
and the site access on Tuesday, November 29, 2016. Afternoon dismissal peak period counts were also
conducted at the 24th Street E intersections with Meridian Avenue E, 94th Avenue E, and the Northwood
Elementary site access driveway on Tuesday, November 29 2016. The afternoon dismissal peak period
count at the Meridian Avenue E/16th Street E intersection was performed on Wednesday, December 7,
2016. Morning counts were performed from 7:00 to 9:00 A.M. and afternoon counts were performed from
2:00 to 4:00 P.M. The existing (2016) morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hour traffic volumes
are shown on Figure 3; the count data sheets are provided in Appendix A.


2.3. Traffic Operations
2.3.1. Off-Site Study-Area Intersections

Traffic operations analyses were performed for the study-area intersections. Traffic operations are
evaluated using levels of service (LOS) with six letter designations, “A” through “F.” LOS A is the best
and represents the best traffic operation with little or no delay to motorists. LOS F is the worst and
indicates poor traffic operations with long delays. The level of service definitions and thresholds are
provided in Appendix B. The City’s adopted minimum operational standard for intersections along the
Meridian Avenue E corridor is LOS E. For all other arterial and collector intersections, the standard is
LOS D (with some limited exceptions that do not apply to the study area intersections).10

Transportation Technical Report

Levels of service were determined using procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual.11 Delay
calculations rely on complex equations that consider a number of variables. For example, delay at
signalized intersections is determined based on traffic volumes by lane group, signal phasing and timing,
and the quality of progression along a corridor. Delay at unsignalized intersections is determined for
vehicles that must stop or yield for oncoming traffic. That delay is related to the availability of gaps in the
main street's traffic flow and the ability of a driver to enter or pass through those gaps.

All level of service calculations were performed using the Synchro 9.1 traffic operations analysis software.
The software models reflect current intersection geometries and levels of service were reported using the
Synchro module for signalized intersections, which refines Highway Capacity Manual methods to account
for more detailed driving behavior and signal operations. Timing data for the signalized intersections were
obtained from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Input data for this analysis,
including geometric characteristics, signal timing, and signal phasing were verified through field
observations. Results for unsignalized intersections were reported using the HCM 2010 module. Table 1
summarizes levels of service for existing (2016) morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hours at the
off-site study-area intersections. As shown, all study area intersections currently operate at LOS C or
better during the morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hours. The level of service calculation
sheets are included in Appendix C.

     3.    n/a = Not applicable. This intersection is not evaluated for the afternoon dismissal peak hour because the project would generate
           fewer than 20 trips through this intersection during that hour.

As shown, the Meridian Avenue E/24th Street E intersection operates at LOS C during the afternoon
peak hour. During the analysis scoping discussions, the City’s transportation review consultant noted
that queues of southbound traffic on Meridian Avenue E can form during the commuter PM peak period
south of the 24th Street E intersection where Meridian Avenue E narrows from two lanes to one lane
(approximately 550 feet downstream of the intersection). It was noted by the City’s consultant that this
queuing condition can affect and sometimes prevent westbound-to-southbound left turns from 24th
Street E. Field observations conducted at the intersections found that these queues did not occur during
the afternoon dismissal peak hour between 2:45 and 3:45 P.M.

2.3.2. Site Access Operations & Queuing

Operations at the existing site access driveway were also evaluated. The pedestrian crossing activity,
peaking characteristics of school traffic, and heavy vehicle volumes (including school buses), have all
been accounted for in these operations analyses. It is noted that there are currently few residences near the
school and only one pedestrian was counted at the driveway during the morning and afternoon peak hours
(crossing the north leg of the existing school access). Table 2 summarizes levels of service for existing
(2016) morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hours. As shown, the driveway currently operates at
LOS A overall and all movements currently operate at LOS C or better during the morning arrival and
afternoon dismissal peak hours.

Peak school-related queuing typically occurs in the afternoon when family-vehicles arrive on site and
drivers wait for dismissal. Therefore, afternoon site access and on-site queuing conditions were
observed on Tuesday, January 3, 2017. The observations found that family drivers begin arriving at the
site to pick up students prior to 2:55 P.M. Many line up along the side of the one-way loop road on-site
rather than parking in available spaces in the lot; however, parking spaces filled up closer to the 3:16
P.M. dismissal time. The number of waiting vehicles was highest just before dismissal and included a
total of about 62 cars with about 46 vehicles around the on-way loop and about 16 vehicles that used
empty parking stalls within the parking lot.

The inbound queue of vehicles did not extend past the on-site gore point where the two-way driveway
splits into one-way segments. Since the queue did not extend to 24th Street E, there was no interference
from inbound school traffic with operations on 24th Street E. The outbound queue for vehicles leaving
the site lasted for about ten minutes and peaked at about 15 vehicles. The main cause for delay leaving
the site was due to left-turning vehicles awaiting adequate gaps in traffic on 24th Street E.


2.4. Parking
As described previously, the existing school has on-site parking with 59 striped spaces in the main lot
and 7 spaces behind the school for a total supply of 66 spaces.

School-day parking demand at elementary schools is primarily driven by staffing levels and family-
volunteer activity. A field count of on-site parking demand was conducted on Tuesday, January 3, 2017
at 1:45 P.M. and found 36 vehicles in the main lot and 6 vehicles in the back lot for a total demand of 42
vehicles (59% utilized). No on-street parking was observed along 24th Street E in the vicinity of the site.
Based on the current school staffing level (36 employees), the school generates about 1.17 parked

                                                        -8-                              January 27, 2017

vehicles per employee. This rate is consistent with rates for elementary schools observed by Heffron
Transportation at numerous locations throughout Western Washington. ITE’s Parking Generation12
does not include data for elementary schools based on staffing levels (the data provided are based on
enrollment levels and are unclear if they reflect conditions during morning arrival, afternoon dismissal,
or special events). Parking Generation does include an employee-based rate for middle schools of 1.22-
vehicles-per-employee, which is consistent with observations by Heffron Transportation.


2.5. Traffic Safety
As directed by the City’s Transportation review consultant,13 collision data for the study area
intersections and roadway segments along 24th Street E were obtained from WSDOT. These data,
reflecting the period between January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2016 (approximately 3.8 years), were
examined to determine if there are any unusual traffic safety conditions that could impact or be
impacted by the proposed project. The collision data are summarized in Table 3. There were relatively
few collisions reported at the study area intersections during the 3.8-year time period. The highest
number of collisions (9) occurred at the 24th Street E/Meridian Avenue E intersection and reflected an
average of 2.3 collisions per year. Seven of the nine collisions were rear-end collisions, which are more
common along approached to signalized intersections.

A common measure for determining crash rates at intersections is the number of crashes per million
entering vehicles (MEV). The collision rate per MEV is a ratio of the number of collisions and the total
number of vehicles that travel through an intersection over the study period. This collision rate, allows a
comparison of intersections with varying traffic volumes. For example, intersections that have very high
traffic volumes are more likely to have a larger number of collisions; however, the rate of collisions may be
low when considering the volume of traffic. The rate for the 24th Street E/Meridian Avenue E intersection
was determined using estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes. The ADT volumes were estimated
based on PM peak hour counts for the intersections assuming that an intersection’s ADT is 10 times the PM
peak hour volume. This estimating tool (the inverse is also known as a K-factor—0.1 in this case) is
commonly applied to estimate daily traffic. Collision rates higher than 1.00 per MEV are considered to be
relatively high and intersections with rates higher than that may merit additional examination from a safety
perspective. The collision rate for the 24th Street E/Meridian Avenue E intersection is 0.27 and is well
below 1.00 collision per MEV over the 3.8-year period. None of the intersection or roadway segment
collisions involved fatalities. The data for the study area do not indicate any unusual traffic safety
conditions along either the roadway segment or study area intersections along 24th Street E.

2.6. Transit Facilities and Service
The site is not directly served with transit stops; however, Pierce Transit provides bus service within the
larger City of Edgewood and Pierce County areas. The closest transit stops are located about ¼ mile to
the east on Meridian Avenue E at the 24th Street E intersection (the southbound stop is on the south side
and the northbound stop is on the north side). These stops are served by Pierce Transit Route 402, which
operates seven days per week between Meridian, Puyallup, and Federal Way. Weekday service is
provided from about 5:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M. with headways (time between consecutive buses) of 30
minutes to an hour. The transit facilities and service are shown on Figure 4.


2.7. Non-Motorized Transportation Facilities
As described in the Roadway Network section, Meridian Avenue E has sidewalks and 4-foot wide
shoulders for bicycles on both sides of the roadway within the study area. There are marked crosswalks
with pedestrian signals at all three signalized study-area intersections. There is a signed and marked
midblock crosswalk on Meridian Avenue E just south of 18th Street Court E. The non-motorized
facilities are also shown on Figure 4.

3. FUTURE BASELINE CONDITIONS
This section of the report presents the future conditions without the proposed project. Year 2019 was
selected as the future horizon year for the analyses because this is the year the replacement school is
planned to opened. For comparison, and to provide an analysis of potential new traffic and parking
impacts, year 2019 without-project conditions assume the existing Northwood Elementary School
would operate at its existing capacity of 436 students. The following sections describe planned
improvements, traffic volumes, and traffic operations (in terms of levels of service).


3.1. Planned Transportation Projects in Site Vicinity
The City of Edgewood’s adopted 2017-2022 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP)14 was reviewed to determine
if any proposed projects would affect study-area roadways or intersections. No funded roadway or non-
motorized projects within the study area are identified in the CIP that are expected to affect the capacity or
operations at the study area intersections by year 2019 when the proposed Northwood Elementary School
Replacement project would be complete and occupied.

It is noted that the City of Edgewood is working to implement its Meridian Avenue Corridor Projects,
which are identified in the Edgewood 2035 Comprehensive Plan. Near the project site, planned
improvements include new grid streets along the along the alignments of 20th Street E (Project W-3) and
100th Avenue E (Project W-4) as described below.

        Project W-3: 20th Street E – Construct a new Collector Arterial segment of 20th Street E from
         101st Avenue E to Meridian Avenue E.
        Project W-4: 20th Street E / 100th Avenue E / 24th Street E – Construct a new Collector Arterial
         segment of 100th Avenue E between 24th Street E and 20th Street E.

The alignment of the planned new segment of 100th Avenue E (Project W-4) falls along the eastern edge of
the northern portion of the school site. As a result, the District will be requested to dedicate right-of-way to
the City for this roadway’s future completion. Since completion of these two projects will rely on right-of-
way that has not yet been acquired by the City and the timing of design and construction is unknown at this
time, these projects were not assumed to be complete in 2019 for this analysis. Therefore, the existing
roadway network was assumed for all analyses of 2019 conditions.


3.2. Forecast 2019 Background Traffic Volumes
Traffic forecasts were developed for future 2019 without-project conditions based on guidance
provided by the City’s transportation review consultant. Based on this direction, a 2% compound
annual growth rate was applied to the existing 2016 traffic volumes. In addition, traffic estimates
associated with 17 planned development projects (called ‘pipeline projects’) was then added to the
background traffic estimates to reflect year 2019 conditions. The 17 pipeline projects are listed below:

              The Arbors at Edgewood                         Nicklaus Property
              Caldwell Crest                                 North Edgewood Apartments
              Edgewood Apartments                            Northwood Estates
              Edgewood Commercial                            Pascolo Estates
              Edgewood Estates                               Rainier Vista

               Edgewood Heights                                   View Pointe
               Edgewood Memory Care                               Westridge Plat
               Edgewood View Point                                Wolf Point
               Jovita Crossing

It is noted that construction of some of these developments has already begun and some are partially
occupied. As a result, the existing counts may already include some of the associated pipeline traffic
and the future forecasts may overstate the actual total background volumes.

Traffic assignments for these pipeline projects were provided by the City’s Transportation review
consultant. These pipeline assignments primarily reflected trips estimated for the commuter PM peak
hour (the highest hour between 4:00 and 6:00 P.M.) and did not have estimates of traffic generated
during the morning arrival or afternoon dismissal peak hours being evaluated for the Northwood
Elementary School Replacement project. Therefore, the pipeline traffic estimates were adjusted to
reflect the amount of traffic that could be generated by these developments during the morning and
afternoon analysis peak hours. The methodology used to adjust the pipeline traffic estimates was
coordinated with the City’s transportation review consultant.15 Report 365 Travel Estimation
Techniques for Urban Planning16 from the National Cooperative Highway Research Program
(NCHRP) identifies time-of-day characteristics for home-based and non-home-based trips for areas of
varying populations.17 The percentages of trips provided for Home-Based trips, which accounts for
the types of trips expected from the pipeline development, were combined to derive ratios of the
commuter PM peak hour for the morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hours. These published
data indicate that Home-Based trips during the 8:00 to 9:00 A.M. school arrival hour are 81.5% of the
trip generated during the traditional commuter PM peak hour. Therefore, to estimate pipeline traffic
during the morning arrival peak hour, a factor of 81.5% was applied to the PM peak hour pipeline
trips. In addition, in order to account for the reverse commute patterns in the morning, the assignments
were reversed (e.g. southbound trips on Meridian Avenue E during the PM peak hour would be
northbound during the morning).

Similarly, the data indicate that trips occurring between 3:00 and 4:00 P.M. (representing the afternoon
dismissal peak hour 2:45 to 3:45 P.M.) are 81.8% of the commuter PM peak hour. To estimate pipeline
traffic during the afternoon dismissal peak hour, a factor of 81.8% was applied to the PM peak hour
pipeline trips. The resulting pipeline traffic estimates were then added to the forecasts to reflect 2019
without-project traffic estimates for each analysis period. The resulting 2019 “without project”
volumes during morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hours are shown on Figure 5. The
combination of the growth rate and the assumed pipeline trips at the intersections results in 2019
volumes that are between 29% and 49% higher than existing. The pipeline development traffic
represents between 18% and 29% of the forecast 2019 total entering volumes.

17   Based on guidance from the City’s Transportation consultant, although City of Edgewood population is below 10,000;17
     commute patterns for the area are largely reflective of the greater Puget Sound region and the published travel
     characteristics for areas with population sizes of 1,000,000 or greater were applied.

3.3. Traffic Operations

3.3.1. Off-Site Study-Area Intersections

Levels of service for study area intersections were calculated for the 2019-without-project background
conditions using the methodology described previously. Table 4 shows the results of the level of service
analysis; results for the 2016 existing conditions are included for comparison.

As shown, the assumed growth in background traffic (including pipeline development and the assumed
2% compound annual growth) is forecast to result in increased delays at all study area intersections
during both study time periods. However, the signalized intersections would continue to operate at LOS
D or better, meeting the City’s minimum LOS standard. However, it is noted that some movements,
such as left turns from 24th Street E to Meridian Avenue E may operate below LOS D or E. All
movements at the 24th Street E/94th Avenue E intersection are forecast to operate at LOS D or better
during both peak hours in 2019 without the project.

3.3.2. Site Access Operations & Queuing

Future operations at the site access driveway were also evaluated and are presented in Table 5. As
shown, the forecast growth in background traffic volumes on 24th Street E is expected to degrade access
operations to LOS B overall in the morning and LOS C overall in the afternoon. Southbound turns from
the site driveway are forecast to degrade to LOS E in the morning and LOS F in the afternoon.

On-site queuing conditions related to family drivers waiting for afternoon dismissal are not anticipated
to change noticeably for the future without-project conditions. However, the outbound queue for
vehicles leaving the site may be increased due to additional delays for those turning left.



4. FUTURE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS
This section describes the conditions that would exist with the proposed new Northwood Elementary
School at its enrollment capacity of 730 students. Potential impacts to study-area traffic operations, site
access, queuing, transit, safety, non-motorized facilities, and parking were evaluated. In addition,
analysis of special event conditions and construction were examined. The following sections describe
the methodology used to determine the proposed project’s impacts.


4.1. Traffic Volumes
The proposed project is expected to generate new trips on the surrounding transportation network. With
the enrollment capacity increase from 436 students to the proposed capacity of 730 students, the school
is expected to generate an increase in morning and afternoon peak hour traffic compared to existing
conditions. The following describes the assumptions used to estimate the potential net increases in
traffic during the key analysis periods.

4.1.1. School Trip Generation Rates
Peak hour trip generation for the school was determined using rates developed from counts performed at
the existing Northwood Elementary School on Tuesday, November 29, 2016. The trip results and trip
rates are summarized in Table 6. The average rates published in the Institute of Transportation
Engineers’ [ITE] Trip Generation Manual18 for Elementary Schools (Land Use Code 520) are shown
for comparison. The morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hour rates observed at Northwood
Elementary are somewhat higher than the average published ITE rates. It is noted that these rates reflect
all trips generated by the school including student pick-up/drop-offs, school bus trips, parent trips,
teacher/staff trips, and visitors.

4.1.2. Trip Generation Estimates for Replacement School

Table 7 summarizes the forecast trip generation for the existing and proposed replacement Northwood
Elementary School based upon the calculated rates described above. It reflects the planned increase in
capacity from 436 to 730 students. As shown, the project is forecast to result in net increases of 175
morning arrival peak hour trips and 130 afternoon dismissal peak hour trips.

4.1.3. Trip Distribution and Assignment

Separate project trip distribution patterns and assignments were developed for the morning and afternoon
peak hours to reflect typical patterns of some family drivers linking trips with work trips. The trip
distribution patterns were based on a combination of sources including traffic flow patterns derived from
new counts taken in November 2016, the overall residential density within the existing enrollment area
for Northwood Elementary School, and planned increases in residential homes within the enrollment area.

The current enrollment boundary for Northwood Elementary has about two-thirds of its area extending
southwest of the school to N Levee Road E on the south and about 70th Avenue E to the west. The
remaining third of the area surrounds the school site and extends northeast to 8th Street E on the north and
122nd Avenue E on the east. It is recognized that attendance areas are subject to review by the Boundary
Review Committee and ultimately the Puyallup School Board. Current planning indicates most planned
growth in Edgewood is in the Northwood attendance area, which may indicate boundary changes for
Northwood Elementary School would be minor. However, any changes will not be known until late 2018.
The resulting total project trip distribution patterns and assignments for the morning arrival and afternoon
dismissal peak hours are shown on Figure 6.

4.1.1. Forecast With-Project Traffic Volumes

To estimate 2019 traffic volumes with the proposed project, the project trips were added to the 2019
without-project volumes described and presented previously. Forecast 2019 with-project volumes for
morning and afternoon peak hours are shown on Figure 7.


4.2. Traffic Operations
4.2.1. Off-Site Study-Area Intersections

Intersection levels of service for future with-project conditions at the off-site intersections were
determined using the same methodology described previously. Table 8 summarizes forecast 2019-with-
project levels of service; the without-project results are shown for comparison. As shown, the school
project is expected to add some delay to the off-site study-area intersections; however, all four are
expected to continue operating at without-project levels—LOS D or better—with the proposed
Northwood Elementary School project during both peak hours.

4.2.2. Site Access Operations & Queuing

Channelization Needs

The need for left-turn lanes at the site driveways on 24th Street E was evaluated using two methods.
First, the method preferred by Pierce County and outlined in Highway Research Record (HRR) 211
Volume Warrants for Left-Turn Storage Lanes at Unsignalized Grade Intersections19 was applied. This
methodology is used to assess the need for left-turn lanes on streets or highways where left-turning
drivers must yield to oncoming traffic. With this methodology, the left-turn lane is warranted if there is
a high probability that left-turning vehicles would unduly delay vehicles approaching from the same
direction as the left turn. The methodology is based on the relationship of advancing volume, opposing
volume, and left-turn percentages at an unsignalized intersection.

To evaluate the warrants, the advancing volume, opposing volume, and left-turn percentages were
compared to the applicable charts in the appendix of HRR 211. HRR 211 provides specific curves for
design speeds of 40 mph and above, and for left turn percentages up to 40%. Therefore, it reflects a
conservative analysis tool for 24th Street E, which has a posted speed limit of 35 mph and school zone
speed limit of 20 mph. Table 9 summarizes the turning volumes and analysis results for the two access
intersections. As shown, the highest volume of left-turns is expected to occur at the proposed new
easternmost access driveway on 24th Street E (where passenger-vehicle access and egress would be
consolidated). Smaller numbers of left turns are expected during peak hours at the western access
driveway that would be designated for school buses and staff only. The eastern (main access) driveway
would meet warrants for left-turn storage of 75-feet during both the morning arrival and afternoon
dismissal peak hours in 2019 with the project. The analysis charts are attached in Appendix D.

Transportation Technical Report

    At unsignalized intersections, use the following as a guide to determine whether or not to provide
    one-way left-turn lanes:
           A traffic analysis indicates congestion reduction with a left-turn lane. On two-lane
            highways, use Exhibit 1310-7a, based on total traffic volume (DHV) for both directions and
            percent left- turn traffic, to determine whether further investigation is needed.
           A study indicates crash reduction with a left-turn lane.
           Restrictive geometrics require left-turning vehicles to slow greatly below the speed of the
            through traffic.
           There is less than decision sight distance for traffic approaching a vehicle stopped at the
            intersection to make a left turn.
    A traffic analysis based on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) may also be used to determine
    whether left-turn lanes are needed to maintain the desired level of service.

Exhibit 1310-7a – Left-Turn Storage Guidelines: Two-Lane, Unsignalized from the WSDOT Design
Manual was used together with the forecast 2019 morning arrival and afternoon dismissal peak hour
traffic volumes on 24th Street E as described above. The warrant exhibit only provides guidance for
roadways with posted speed limits of 40 mph or higher; therefore, the lowest (40 mph) curve was
applied. As shown on the attached warrant evaluation sheet, the forecast-with-project traffic volumes
and the resulting left-turn percentages at the eastern access driveway would fall above the warrant
curves for both peak hour conditions. Therefore, the WSDOT guidelines also indicate left-turn storage is
needed to accommodate the left-turning traffic at that access. The WSDOT guidance also indicates that
left-turn storage would not be needed at the western school-bus staff access driveway.

The exact design and limits of the widening on 24th Street E for the left-turn storage should be
coordinated with City of Edgewood staff based on the various existing constraints including: nearby
wetlands; available right-of-way; topographical constraints; and planned future improvements that may be
incorporated into the future 100th Avenue E grid street project. However, for planning purposes, the
following provides estimates of the potential channelization.

Exhibit 1310-8a – Left-Turn Storage Length: Two-Lane, Unsignalized (40 mph) from the WSDOT
Design Manual was used to determine a potential storage length for the left-turn lane at the eastern (main)
access driveway. As shown on the attached evaluation sheet, the morning arrival peak hour volumes
indicate a storage length of 100 feet would be appropriate. The analysis charts are attached in Appendix
D.

Based on the two methods (HRR 211 and WSDOT Design Manual), left-turn storage of 75 to 100 feet is
recommended. Widening of 24th Street E would also be required to accommodate transitions and taper
lengths. Taper lengths may vary based on jurisdiction preferences. However, the WSDOT recommended
taper ratio for a 35-mph roadway is 35:1 (taper length to width of left-turn lane on departure side of
centerline per Exhibit 1310-10a – Median Channelization: Widening from the WSDOT Design Manual).
Assuming the center left-turn storage lane is 12-feet wide (6 feet on each side of the centerline), the taper
length could be as long as 210 feet (35 × 6 = 210). A shadow taper (also assumed to be 210 feet in length)
could be required west of the access roadway. In addition, to help facilitate left-turns out of the site, a
short center acceleration storage area (about 50 feet) is recommended to accommodate two-stage left-
turns from the east driveway. Therefore, the total widening of 24th Street E to accommodate the left-turn
lane could extend between 580 and 605 feet (assuming 210 feet for the transition and taper east of the
access driveway, 75 to 100 feet for storage, 35 feet to accommodate the width of the access driveway, 50
feet for eastbound acceleration storage, and 210 feet for the taper west of the access driveway). These
lengths may need to be adjusted based on noted constraints.

Transportation Technical Report

The segment of 24th Street E where the school driveways are planned is straight and flat. No sight-line
obstructions (either horizontal curves or vertical curves) would interfere with sight-distance for drivers
turning to or from the driveways in either direction.

Access Operations

With-project operations at the site access driveways were evaluated reflecting the recommended
channelization from the previous section. There are two residential developments planned on the north side
of 24th Street E to the west within walking distance of the site and it is possible that the replacement school
could generate some additional pedestrian or bicycle trips. In addition, the larger school is expected to
require additional school buses. Therefore, the potential increases in pedestrian crossing activity and school
buses have been accounted for in the operations analyses of the site access intersections. The results are
presented in Table 10.

As shown, operations at the west access driveway (serving school buses and some staff trips) are projected
to operate at LOS A overall and all movements are forecast at LOS D or better. The new east access that
would serve the main parking lot and the pick-up/drop-off loop is also forecast to operate at LOS A overall
during both periods with the recommended channelization. During both analysis periods, the southbound
left-turn movement would operate at LOS D and the southbound right-turn movement would operate at
LOS B. It is acknowledged that operations could be worse for left-turns out of the site, if drivers are
unwilling to use the center acceleration area for two-stage left-turns to eastbound 24th Street E. It is likely
that there would be some congestion leaving the site for about 20 minutes twice each school day—during
morning arrival and afternoon dismissal.

On-Site Queuing Conditions

Peak queuing conditions are expected to increase with the larger school capacity. In the mornings,
school drop-off activities usually occur with limited queues or delay. This is because arrivals tend to be

                                                                     - 23 -                                       January 27, 2017

spread out over the 20 to 30 minutes before school start time. During this period, family drivers
generally arrive, drop off students, and then immediately leave the site. In the afternoons, many drivers
arrive early and wait in the queue lane(s) or parking spaces for the students to be dismissed, and longer
vehicle queues can develop.

The morning arrival queue can be modeled directly using Poisson arrival methodologies for a multi-
channel service system (i.e., the number of drop-off spaces that can be used simultaneously).
Assumptions documented from queuing data collection at Bellevue School District schools were used for
this analysis.20 This includes the assumption that it takes about 15 seconds for students to exit a vehicle
while at the drop-off location space and the entire morning arrival time for a school occurs within 20
minutes. This equates to a service rate for each drop-off space of 4 vehicles per minute (80 vehicles in 20
minutes or a rate of 240 vehicles per hour). For the Northwood Elementary School Replacement, the total
estimated morning arrival peak hour volume is 240 vehicles (as presented in the Trip Generation section);
however, 197 are forecast to arrive at the main load/unload area. To account for the compressed 20-
minute arrival period, the arrival rate for the model is three times this level or 591 vehicles per hour.

Students could be dropped off anywhere along the load/unload zone shown on the site plan (see Figure 2),
which allows 26 spaces to be used at one time. However, to provide an analysis of potential worst-case
conditions, a range of 10 to 15 spaces was evaluated to estimate both the average and 95th-percentile
queues for the drop-off area closest to the building. Table 11 presents the estimated queues for the
assumed drop-off spaces at the proposed school during the morning arrival. As shown, the estimated
morning arrival queue is expected be accommodated on-site and is not expected to exceed the available
load/unload zone capacity. The queue model calculation results are included in Appendix D.

 Source:    Heffron Transportation, Inc., January 2017, using service rate assumptions based on observations included in the Enatai
            Elementary School Traffic Impact Analysis, (Gibson Traffic Consultants, August 2014).

Although the queue analysis and estimation model is reasonable for application to morning arrival
queues, the afternoon queueing conditions are different. Family drivers arrive prior to school dismissal
during a time when no vehicles are being loaded (or serviced). In addition, students arrive at their family
vehicles at different rates, so the service times per vehicle are different than during morning arrival.
Therefore, on-site vehicle queue estimates during afternoon school dismissal were based on observations
at the existing Northwood Elementary and at a Puyallup School District elementary school with
enrollment similar to that proposed for Northwood.

Based on observations at the existing school and adjusting proportionately based on enrollment (730
proposed future compared to 429 existing), the maximum afternoon queue demand is estimated at about
105 vehicles. For comparison, afternoon dismissal queues were observed on Wednesday, January 4, 2017
at Edgerton Elementary School,21 which currently has enrollment of 740 students in K-6 and 33 students
in pre-K. Based on those observations, the peak number of vehicles observed just before dismissal was
110 (including 45 in the main pick-up queue, about 60 waiting within the parking lot, and about 5 on

surrounding streets). Based on these observations, the estimated afternoon vehicle demand estimate of
105 vehicles is a reasonable approximation for the larger Northwood Elementary Replacement.

The on-site passenger-vehicle load/unload loop would provide space for 26 vehicles to load/unload
simultaneously and the proposed new main access driveway is roughly long enough (about 800 feet to
the first load/unload space) to accommodate about 40 vehicles before spilling back onto 24th Street E.
Combined, the site proposes a total queuing length of about 1,320 linear feet. Planning research and
guidance from several sources suggest providing on-site queue stacking of between 1.2 and 2.0 feet per
student.22 In addition, the main visitor lot is expected to have between 35 and 40 parking spaces
available in the late afternoon where family drivers can park and wait for students. Finally, during the
peak few minutes around dismissal, there are typically some vehicles circulating within the drive aisles
of the parking lot. In total, the site could accommodate between 100 and 120 vehicles on-site without
spilling onto 24th Street E, which would meet the demand expected and would fall at the upper end of
the referenced guidance.

It is acknowledged that some fluctuation in volumes and queuing activities are common as they can be
affected by weather, special events, and unfamiliarity with drop-off/pick-up procedures at the beginning
of each school year. It is noted that family drivers with younger students are more likely to park their
vehicles and walk their children to and from the school.


4.3. Transit Facilities & Service
It is possible that some transit trips could be generated by teachers or staff at the site. However, the
nearest transit stops are about ¼ mile away and the number of added transit trips is likely to be very
small. School bus transportation would continue to be provided to those students that qualify. The
project is not expected to result in adverse impacts to transit.


4.4. Non-Motorized Transportation Facilities
The project would construct a new walkway along its frontage on the north side of 24th Street E. The
larger school may attract some additional pedestrian and bicycle trips within the local site vicinity,
particularly from the planned new residential development located immediately to the west. Prior to
opening of the replacement school, the District should review and identify any changes to walk routes,
crosswalk locations, and/or crossing guard locations.


4.5. Parking
4.5.1. School Day Parking

As described previously, school-day parking at elementary schools is primarily driven by staffing levels
and family-volunteer activity. The District estimates that Northwood Elementary School could have up
to 61 employees with the school at its planned capacity of 730 students. Using the parking rate derived
specifically for Northwood Elementary, the larger replacement school is projected to have a midday
parking demand of about 71 vehicles, which is likely to occur midday when teachers, administrative
staff, kitchen staff, and volunteers are typically on site. The proposed on-site parking supply of 110
spaces is expected to accommodate typical midday peak parking demand.

4.5.2. Evening Event Parking

Similar to the existing school, the Northwood Elementary School Replacement would have common
spaces and a gymnasium that are expected to be used for occasional evening and/or weekend events at
the school. The types of events typically held at the school include the following.

       Large School Events – Typically occur about once per month or once every other month. The
        largest events occur two or three times per year and usually include: Curriculum Night/Open
        House, Holiday Boutique, musical concerts or talent shows, and STEM or science fairs and
        showcases. Some of the larger events have staggered arrivals and not all attendees are on site at
        once, while others have fixed start and end times and all attendees are on site simultaneously.

       PTA (or other) Meetings – There are commonly one or two smaller PTA events per month that
        usually occur in the library. Typically, attendance ranges from about 30 to 100 people.

       Community Use – The site may be scheduled for use by community groups (e.g. Cub Scouts,
        Boy Scouts, Brownies, etc.) or recreational sports on the playfield or in the gymnasium.
        Community-use events usually have smaller attendance levels of 10 to 50 people, but may occur
        more frequently.

For evening events, the on-site parking supply of 110 spaces would be available. Room for another 26
parked vehicles would exist in the family-vehicle load/unload zone and another 20 parked vehicles in
the school-bus load/unload zone, bringing the on-site total to 156 spaces for evening or weekend events.

For larger evening events, there are typically between 3.0 and 3.5 persons attending for each parked
vehicle. This rate accounts for higher levels of carpooling (families and students in a single vehicle) as
well as drop-off activity that does not generate parked vehicles. At these rates, the on-site parking
supply could accommodate events with attendance of between 465 and 545 persons. If event parking
demand exceeds these levels or if larger attendance levels are expected, it may be necessary to modify
the event to reduce total peak demand. For example, curriculum night could be separated into two nights
based on grade levels.


4.6. Construction Traffic
The existing school will continue to operate on the site while the new school is being constructed. This
will require careful coordination to make sure that construction activities do not affect school
loading/unloading and parking operations when school is in session.

The District should require the selected contractor to develop a construction management plan (CMP)
that addresses traffic and pedestrian control during school construction. It should define truck routes,
lane closures, walkway closures, and parking disruptions, as necessary. The CMP may also include
measures to keep adjacent streets clean on a daily basis at the truck exit points (such as street sweeping
or on-site truck wheel cleaning) to reduce tracking dirt offsite. The CMP should identify parking
locations for the construction staff; to the extent possible, construction employee parking should be
contained on-site.

4.7. Long-Term Conditions
As described previously the City of Edgewood is working to implement its Meridian Avenue Corridor
Projects, which are identified in the Edgewood 2035 Comprehensive Plan. Near the project site, planned
improvements include new grid streets along the along the alignments of 20th Street E (Project W-3) and
100th Avenue E (Project W-4).

Since the alignment of the planned new segment of 100th Avenue E (Project W-4) falls along the eastern
edge of the northern portion of the school site, the Puyallup School District has been coordinating with
the City to determine right-of-way dedication requirements. It is expected that the two projects would be
constructed by either the City (if and when all necessary right-of-way is acquired) or by other adjacent
land owners as part of re-development of their properties.

The City of Edgewood recommended the District design team explore options to provide access, egress,
or both from the planned new 100th Avenue E. Options for this access configuration were examined;
however, the school’s site layout was designed to ensure access will function at opening in 2019 and to
provide the maximize amount of on-site queue capacity to avoid overspill to City roadways. The on-site
circulation and travel paths have been arranged to maximize on-site efficiency and reduce or eliminate
conflicts among and between modes (school buses, passenger vehicles, and staff). Therefore, the
District and its design team believe the site plan presented provides the best opportunity to meet District
project objective based on programming and site constraints. Once the City’s new grid streets
(particularly 100th Avenue E) are complete, site access to the new replacement Northwood Elementary
School could be modified to allow for service/delivery vehicle access onto the new 100th Avenue E at
the north end of the school site. A future pedestrian connection to 100th Avenue E is also planned; the
exact design and location will be coordinated with City staff.




                                                 - 27 -                                January 27, 2017

5. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1. Findings of Needed Improvement
Based on the analysis presented, no improvements would be required at off-site intersections to
accommodate the proposed Northwood Elementary School Replacement project. However,
improvements to 24th Street E along the site frontage, consisting of left-turn storage of 75 to 100 feet,
are recommended at the east access driveway. Widening of 24th Street E would be required to
accommodate transitions and tapers in both directions. The exact design and limits of the widening on
24th Street E for the left-turn storage should be coordinated with City of Edgewood staff based on the
various existing constraints including: nearby wetlands; available right-of-way; topographical
constraints; and planned future improvements that may be incorporated into the future 100th Avenue E
grid street project.


5.2. Proposed Mitigation Recommendations
The following measures are recommended to reduce and minimize transportation-related impacts from
the school replacement project.

     A. Prior to opening of the replacement school, the District should review and identify any changes
        to walk routes, crosswalk locations, and/or crossing guard locations.

     B. The school should develop a transportation and parking management plan to minimize the
        traffic and parking impacts associated with large events. The plan should identify locations for
        event parking (e.g. bus or passenger call load/unload zones) and ensure that all parking areas are
        open and available during large events. If large events are anticipated to generate demand that
        would exceed the on-site event parking supply, the school should examine ways to reduce the
        demand and event attendance (e.g. through splitting events based on grade levels).

     C. The District should require the selected contractor to develop a construction management plan
        (CMP) that addresses traffic and pedestrian control during school construction. It should define
        truck routes, lane closures, walkway closures, and parking disruptions, as necessary. The CMP
        may also include measures to keep adjacent streets clean on a daily basis at the truck exit points
        (such as street sweeping or on-site truck wheel cleaning) to reduce tracking dirt offsite. The
        CMP should identify parking locations for the construction staff; to the extent possible,
        construction employee parking should be contained on-site.


5.3. Transportation Impact Fee Estimate
The City of Edgewood collects traffic impact fees for new development. Based on rates published for
Elementary Schools (Land Use 520) in Exhibit A from City of Edgewood Ordinance 15-0438,23 the
impact fee rate for this project would be $274 per student of added capacity. Based on this rate and the
proposal to increase school capacity by 294 students (from 436 to 730), the estimated impact fee would
be $80,556. The City also collects a 5% administrative fee at the time of impact fee payment, which
would add $4,028 to the total. However, the project would likely be eligible for credit against this fee
per the Edgewood Municipal Code Section 4.30.100.A, which states:



23   Adopted 4/28/2015; effective 5/4/2015.
                                                 - 28 -                               January 27, 2017

    An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against the applicable traffic impact fee collected under the
    fee schedule adopted by the ordinance codified in this chapter for the value of any dedication of land
    for, improvement to, or new construction of, any system improvements provided by the applicant, to
    facilities that are:
        1. Included within the six-year transportation improvement program and identified as system
           improvements that are to be funded in part by traffic impact fees; and
        2. At suitable sites and constructed at an acceptable quality as determined by the city; and
        3. Completed, dedicated, or otherwise transferred to the city prior to the determination and
           award of a credit as set forth in this section.

The dedication of right-of-way for the new 100th Avenue E arterial segment may meet these requirements
at the time of building permit and impact fee collection. Therefore, the costs of the right-of-way may be
credited against the traffic impact fee amount.

It should be noted that traffic impact fees are due and payable before the building permit is issued by the
City based on the fee rates in effect at that time. According to City code, claims for credit are processed
by the City using whichever of the following options is selected by the applicant:
    1. Claims for credits that are submitted prior to, or with, an application for a building permit for
       which an impact fee will be due will be processed by the City before payment of the impact fee is
       due in order to allow any credit authorized by the City to reduce the amount of the impact fee; or
    2. Claims for credits that are submitted no later than 30 days after the issuance of a building permit
       for which an impact fee is due shall be processed by the City after the impact fee is paid in full,
       and any credit authorized by the City will be refunded to the applicant within 90 days of receipt
       of the claim for credit.
Claims for credits that are submitted more than six months after the issuance of a building permit for
which an impact fee is due are deemed to be waived and shall be denied.

                  Level of Service Definitions
 Northwood Elementary School Replacement
 Transportation Technical Report

 Levels of service (LOS) are qualitative descriptions of traffic operating conditions. These levels of
 service are designated with letters ranging from LOS A, which is indicative of good operating condi-
 tions with little or no delay, to LOS F, which is indicative of stop-and-go conditions with frequent and
 lengthy delays. Levels of service for this analysis were developed using procedures presented in the
 Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010).

 Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of delay. Delay can be a cause of driver
 discomfort, frustration, inefficient fuel consumption, and lost travel time. Specifically, level of service
 criteria are stated in terms of the average delay per vehicle in seconds. Delay is a complex measure and
 is dependent on a number of variables including: the quality of progression, cycle length, green ratio,
 and a volume-to-capacity ratio for the lane group or approach in question. Table A-1 shows the level of
 service criteria for signalized intersections from the Highway Capacity Manual.

 For unsignalized two-way-stop-controlled, all-way-stop-controlled, and roundabout intersections, level
 of service is based on the average delay per vehicle. The level of service for a two-way, stop-
 controlled intersection is determined by the computed or measured control delay and is defined for
 each minor movement. Delay is related to the availability of gaps in the main street's traffic flow, and
 the ability of a driver to enter or pass through those gaps. The delay at an all-way, stop-sign (AWSC)
 controlled intersection is based on saturation headways, departure headways, and service times. Delay
 at roundabouts is based on entry flow rates and flow rate capacity. Table A-2 shows the level of
 service criteria for unsignalized intersections from the Highway Capacity Manual.
