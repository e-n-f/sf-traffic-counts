Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic study for the proposed north block renovation and reconfiguration at
the Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo, California. The project site currently is occupied by a Sears store
with 205,801 square feet (s.f.), non-department retail stores (35,747 s.f.), and 16,656 square feet of office area,
which is a total gross leasable area (GLA) of 258,204 square feet. The total gross leasable area of the whole
shopping center is 1,132,607 square feet.
The project would modify the north block of the shopping center by replacing the former Sears department store
with an outdoor plaza surrounded by smaller retail shops and food vendors and by constructing a new fitness
center with 40,090 square feet. The former parking lot along El Camino Real will be removed and be replaced
with new retail spaces, new restaurants, and a new cinema. The new cinema will occupy 43,942 square feet with
10 screens and 804 seats. With the renovation and reconfiguration, the general retail space in the north block
will decrease from 241,548 square feet to 177,673 square feet. The emphasis of the proposed project is on
dining, entertaining, and smaller retail spaces. In total, the GLA size of the center would grow by 20,157 square
feet, from 1,132,607 square feet of gross floor area to 1,152,764 square feet. The total number of parking spaces
for the whole shopping center would be reduced from 5,456 to 5,184, and circulation would change to
accommodate the modifications to the parking areas.
                                                                                                                th
Access to the project site would continue to be provided via the existing driveways along El Camino Real, 30
Avenue, 31st Avenue, and Edison Street. One of the driveways on El Camino Real would be reconfigured to
provide a better connection into the site. The driveway opposite Edison Street would be reconfigured to reduce
the intersection size. The surface parking lot along El Camino Real would be removed and replaced by new retail
stores, restaurants, and a cinema. Circulation within the parking lots would be modified to provide better defined
aisles. 31st Avenue would be slightly reconfigured to widen sidewalks and narrow travel lanes but with no change
in the number of travel lanes.

Project Trip Estimates
Trip generation estimates were based on rates obtained from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
published Trip Generation Manual, Ninth Edition, 2012. The Shopping Center (ITE category 820) and Multiplex
Movie Theater (ITE category 445) rates were applied since these rates best represent the trip generation
characteristics of the project. The proposed cinema complex was analyzed separately from the rest of the
shopping center. To be conservative, Friday PM peak hour rates were used to estimate the trips generated by
the proposed cinema. This represents a worst-case scenario because the Friday PM peak hour trip generation
rates are about 67% higher than the regular weekday PM peak hour rates. Based on the ITE trip rates, the
proposed project would generate fewer trips during the AM peak hour and 185 additional trips during the PM
peak hour (see Table ES 1).

Intersection Level of Service Impacts
Because fewer trips would be generated with the proposed modification of the shopping center compared to
existing conditions during the AM peak hour, intersection levels of service were only calculated for the PM peak
hour. Table ES-2 summarizes the results of the intersection PM peak hour level of service analysis under the
following conditions: existing (Chapter 2), background (Chapter 3), existing plus project (Chapter 4), background
plus project (Chapter 4), and cumulative with project (Chapter 5) conditions. The results of the level of service
calculations show that all of the study intersections would operate at mid-level of service (LOS) D or better under
all conditions, which is in accordance with San Mateo LOS standards.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
The intersections of Hacienda Street/31st Avenue, Edison Street/31st Avenue, and Edison Street/Hillsdale
Boulevard currently operate with all-way stop control. The level of service analysis at these intersections showed
that all of them would operate at acceptable levels of service under all conditions. Furthermore, signal warrant
analyses were performed based on the peak-hour turning-movement volumes projected at these intersections
(see Appendix C). The analysis concluded that the projected peak-hour traffic volumes would not warrant
signalization at any of these unsignalized intersections.

Pedestrians, Bicycles and Transit
The project’s impact to pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities was evaluated (see Chapter 6).
The existing sidewalk system surrounding the site is sufficient to accommodate the pedestrian traffic generated
by the proposed redevelopment. The project proposes to construct a pedestrian path connecting the entrance of
the shopping center and El Camino Real, which would be beneficial to pedestrian circulation. The pedestrian
traffic using the crosswalk at 31st Avenue and East Sailer Drive would increase with the new cinema and retail
stores. Currently, there are stop signs at the shopping center driveway and East Sailer Drive, but the approaches

along 31st Avenue are uncontrolled. It is recommended that a four-way stop or a traffic signal be explored for this
intersection to reduce pedestrian delays, reduce potential vehicle queuing, and improve pedestrian safety.
It is expected that the new transit ridership generated by the proposed project could be accommodated by the
existing transit service provided in the project vicinity.

Site Access, Circulation and Parking
Site access and on-site circulation were evaluated using commonly accepted transportation planning principles.
This review was based on the project site plan dated March 20, 2015. The project is proposing improvements to
the site access and on-site circulation. The main driveway on El Camino Real will be made more prominent and
will connect better to the on-site parking aisles. The driveway on 31st Avenue opposite Edison Street will be
narrowed by removing the existing center island. This will improve visibility within the intersection. That driveway
will lead to a better-defined drive aisle within the parking garage.
With the new cinema and new retail stores proposed at the northwest corner of El Camino Real and 31st Avenue,
it is expected that most of the northbound traffic along El Camino Real will turn left from El Camino Real to 31st
Avenue and use the driveway opposite East Sailer Drive to access the parking garage or drop off customers.
Outbound traffic to northbound El Camino Real might also use this driveway. These vehicles would have to drive
across two pedestrian crosswalks along the pedestrian spine leading to the cinema. The frequent pedestrian
crossings in front of the new cinema could cause a vehicle back up that would block the driveway. Hexagon
recommends that the crosswalks be monitored at project completion and occupancy. If problems are identified,
more positive crosswalk control could be implemented, such as crossing monitors or signals. Hexagon further
recommends that San Mateo explore the option of opening up a new left turn access along El Camino Real at
the main driveway near Wells Fargo. This access would necessitate a slight change to the Hillsdale Station Area
Plan to get the two driveways to line up. Caltrans approval would be needed. There is also a concern that a left
turn at this location would encourage drivers to cut over diagonally across 3 lanes from westbound Hillsdale
Boulevard to turn left. It should be noted that these drivers would not be forced to make that left turn maneuver
                                                                               st
because they also have the option to simply cross El Camino Real at the 31 Avenue signal, which is what they
do today. In the long term, the slip ramp at 31 Avenue will be removed when 31st Avenue is extended under the
                                                 st

railroad tracks.
The required parking supply is determined using the parking rates specified in the City Zoning Code. Section
27.64.160(2)(b) of the City Zoning Code requires that a Regional Shopping Center should provide 3.5 parking
spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area (GFA) and for an indoor theater parking be provided at a ratio of
1 parking stall per 5 seats.. The proposed renovation and reconfiguration will bring the total square footage of the
north block to 291,519 square feet with 43,942 square feet for the new cinema, which would translate to a total
required parking supply of 1,028 parking stalls. There are 1,455 parking spaces are shown on the site plan.
Therefore, the proposed parking supply ratio would exceed the minimum parking requirement.
The City Zoning Code (Section 27.64.262 of) for a Regional Shopping Center requires 1 short-term bike parking
space per 10,000 s.f. and 1 long-term bike parking space per 20,000 s.f. For indoor theaters, the City code
requires 1 short-term bike parking space per 40 fixed-seats and 1 long-term bike parking space per 80 fixed-
seats. To comply with the City code, the project would be required to provide 46 short term bike parking spaces
and 24 long term bike parking spaces. The proposed site plan shows 30 short-term bike parking spaces and 16
long-term bike spaces, which would not meet the minimum bike parking requirement.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic study for the proposed north block renovation and reconfiguration at
the Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo, California. The project site currently is occupied by a Sears store
with 205,801 square feet (s.f.), non-department retail stores (35,747 s.f.), and 16,656 square feet of office area,
which is a total gross leasable area (GLA) of 258,204 square feet. The total gross leasable area of the whole
shopping center is 1,132,607.
The project would modify the north block of the shopping center by replacing the former Sears department store
with an outdoor plaza surrounded by smaller retail shops and food vendors and by constructing a new fitness
center with 40,090 square feet. The former parking lot along El Camino Real will be removed and be replaced
with new retail spaces, new restaurants, and a new cinema. The new cinema will occupy 43,942 square feet with
10 screens and 804 seats. With the renovation and reconfiguration, the general retail space in the north block
will decrease from 240,548 square feet to 177,673 square feet. The emphasis of the proposed project is on
dining, entertaining, and smaller retail spaces. In total, the GLA size of the center would grow by 20,157 square
feet, from 1,132,607 square feet of gross floor area to 1,152,764 square feet. The total number of parking spaces
for the whole shopping center would be reduced from 5,456 to 5,184, and circulation would change to
accommodate the modifications to the parking areas.
                                                                                                                st
Access to the project site would continue to be provided via the existing driveways along El Camino Real, 31
Avenue, and Edison Street. One of the driveways on El Camino Real would be reconfigured to provide a better
connection into the site. The driveway opposite Edison Street would be reconfigured to reduce the intersection
size. Circulation within the parking lots would be modified slightly to provide better defined aisles. 31st Avenue
would be slightly reconfigured to widen sidewalks and narrow travel lanes but with no change in the number of
travel lanes.
The location of the project site and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The proposed site plan is
shown on Figure 2.

Scope of Study
The purpose of the traffic study is to identify any potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project and to
review the proposed site access and circulation. It is estimated that the project would add more than 100 peak
hour vehicle trips on El Camino Real, which is a City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) San Mateo
County Congestion Management Program (CMP) roadway. Therefore, a Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) plan report was prepared. The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Mateo. The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak hour
traffic conditions during weekdays on the following study intersections in the vicinity of the project site.

       El Camino Real and 25th Avenue

       El Camino Real and 28th Avenue
       Hacienda Street and 31st Avenue (unsignalized)
       Edison Street and 31st Avenue (unsignalized)
       El Camino Real and 31st Avenue
       Edison Street and Hillsdale Boulevard (unsignalized)
       El Camino Real and Hillsdale Boulevard (West)
       El Camino Real and Hillsdale Boulevard (East)

Because the proposed reconfiguration and renovation of the shopping center would result in less traffic
compared to existing conditions during the weekday AM peak hour, traffic conditions at the intersections were
only analyzed for the weekday PM peak hours of traffic. The PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00
PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on an average day.
The project includes movie theaters, which will be open later than retail stores and will generate more traffic at
night than during the typical traffic peak hours. However, the ambient traffic levels on the surrounding streets are
much lower at night than during the typical weekday commute time. Therefore, the traffic study does not include
an analysis of nighttime traffic conditions. If the surrounding streets and intersections can accommodate the
project traffic during peak commute times, then the streets also will easily accommodate project traffic at night
when the movie theaters are busiest.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
Scenario 1:     Existing Conditions. Existing intersection volumes were obtained from new manual turning-
                movement counts conducted in 2015. New traffic count data are contained in Appendix A.

Scenario 3:     Background Conditions. Background conditions traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet constructed
                developments in the study area.

Scenario 2:     Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project traffic volumes were estimated by adding
                to existing traffic volumes the trips associated with the proposed project.

Scenario 4:     Background Plus Project Conditions. Background plus project traffic volumes were estimated by
                adding to background traffic volumes the trips associated with the proposed project.

Scenario 5:     2030 Cumulative Conditions. 2030 Cumulative conditions represent future traffic volumes on the
                future transportation network in accordance with the San Mateo General Plan. The 2030 level of
                service results from the San Mateo General Plan, which includes the proposed project, were
                used to describe operating conditions at the study intersections under cumulative conditions. For
                study intersections not included in the General Plan report, the 2030 forecasted volumes from
                the San Mateo Travel Demand Model were used to calculate the levels of service.

Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described above. It
includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable level of service
standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from field observations, new traffic counts, previous traffic
studies, the City of San Mateo, and the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual entitled Trip
Generation, 9th Edition. The following data were collected from these sources:

        existing intersection volumes
        existing lane geometries
        signal timing and phasing
        approved but not yet completed projects
        applicable trip generation rates


Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay,
to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are described below.
City of San Mateo Intersections
Level of service at signalized intersections in the City of San Mateo is evaluated based on the average control
delay for all movements at the intersection. The City of San Mateo level of service standard is mid-LOS D (delay
of 45 seconds) or better for all of the signalized study intersections.
Unsignalized Intersections
For the unsignalized intersections, an assessment was made of the need for signalization. This assessment was
made on the basis of the Peak-hour Volume Signal Warrant described in the California Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). This method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply
provides an indication whether peak-hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a
traffic signal. The signal warrant check was supplemented with an analysis of level of service. The correlation
between delay and level of service for unsignalized intersections is shown in Table 2. The City of San Mateo
does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. Traffic studies typically evaluate whether
unsignalized intersections are functioning adequately and whether signalization is warranted.

               Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the
       A       green phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute           10.0 or less
               to the very low vehicle delay.

               Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle
       B       lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of                 10.1 to 20.0
               average vehicle delay.

               Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
               lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The
       C                                                                                             20.1 to 35.0
               number of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the
               intersection without stopping.

               The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
               result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
       D                                                                                             35.1 to 55.0
               lenghts, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
               individual cycle failures are noticeable.

               This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay
       E       values generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and            55.1 to 80.0
               high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

               This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
               often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
       F                                                                                           greater than 80.0
               capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may
               also be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Significant Impact Criteria
The traffic impacts of the project are evaluated against the following criteria to determine whether the impacts
are significant.

City of San Mateo Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
Per the City’s General Plan Policy C 2.7, all projects are required, at a minimum, to pay a transportation
mitigation fee. The transportation mitigation fee is used to fund planned transportation improvements that are
identified in the City of San Mateo Traffic Mitigation Program.
In addition to paying the transportation impact fee, a development project may be required to fund off-site
circulation improvements which are needed as a result of project generated traffic if:
       a) The acceptable level of service at the intersection (mid-level LOS D, with an average delay of more than
          45 seconds) is exceeded by 4 seconds or more when the project traffic is added, and
       b) The intersection is subject to an increase in delay of 4 or more seconds, and
       c) The needed improvement of the intersection(s) is not funded in the applicable five-year City Capital
          Improvement Program from the date of application approval.
The cost of the off-site improvements may be reimbursed by the City if a reimbursement program is established
throughout the timeframe of the City of San Mateo’s current Traffic Mitigation Program or at the time when the
improvement was initially scheduled.

Report Organization
The remainder of this report is divided into five chapters. Chapter 2 describes existing conditions on the roadway
network and other transportation facilities. Chapter 3 presents the roadway operations under background
conditions. Chapter 4 describes the methods used to estimate the project’s impact on the transportation system.
Chapter 5 describes the cumulative level of service results and Chapter 6 describes non-level of service issues

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of the site,
including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project study area is provided by US 101 and SR 92. These facilities are described
below.
     US 101 is an eight-lane north/south freeway in the vicinity of the site. US 101 extends northward through
     San Francisco and southward through San Jose. Access to and from the project study area is provided via
     its interchanges at Hillsdale Boulevard and SR 92.
     SR 92 is a four- to six-lane east/west freeway extending from Half Moon Bay, in west San Mateo County, to
     Hayward in Alameda County. SR92 has a full interchange at El Camino Real, which serves the study area.
Local access to the project site is provided via El Camino Real, Hillsdale Boulevard, 31st Avenue, and Edison
Street. These roadways are described below.
      El Camino Real (SR 82) is a six-lane north-south major arterial in the vicinity of the site. El Camino Real
      extends from Santa Clara County through San Mateo County. There are sidewalks along both sides of the
      street in the vicinity of the project site. El Camino Real provides direct access to the project site with two
      right-turn only driveways on El Camino Real, one is located just north of the Wells Fargo Bank and another
      one just south of the bank.
      Hillsdale Boulevard is a two- to six-lane roadway that provides direct access to the San Mateo Shopping
      Center southern block. The segment of Hillsdale Boulevard adjacent to the project site has four lanes of
      travel. Hillsdale Boulevard is a two-lane undivided street between SR 92 and Edison Street. East of Edison
      Street, Hillsdale Boulevard widens to four lanes, and then widens again to six lanes east of Saratoga
      Drive.
      31st Avenue serves as the southern boundary for the project site and runs east-west through the shopping
      center. 31st Avenue provides direct access to the site via three full access driveways. The intersection of
      31st Avenue with Edison Street is an unsignalized five-legged intersection with one shopping center
      driveway on the north leg and another shopping center driveway on the south leg.
     Edison Street is a two-lane undivided north/south roadway with two discontinuous segments separated by
     the shopping center. One segment extends from 43rd Avenue in the south to 31st Avenue in the north. The
     north leg of the intersection with 31st Avenue serves as a project driveway. Another segment extends from


                                                                                                            Page | 8

        the interior of the shopping center to 26th Place. There are three project driveways along this segment of
        Edison Street.
        30th Avenue is a two-lane residential street that runs from Monterey Street, across Alameda de las Pulgas,
        to the shopping center parking lot just east of Flores Street. There is a ramp at the end of 30th Avenue that
        provides direct access to the upper deck of the Hillsdale Shopping Center parking garage.

with one stop at Edison Street and Hillsdale Boulevard.
Route ECR, which operates only on weekends, runs about every 20 minutes along El Camino Real from the
Palo Alto Transit Center to the Daly City BART Station, with a bus stop in front of the shopping center.

Caltrain Service
Commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy is provided by Caltrain. The project is located about a
950 foot walk north of the Hillsdale Caltrain station. Caltrain provides service with approximately 20- to 30-minute
headways during the weekday AM and PM commute hours and 60 minute headways midday, at nights and on
weekends. To get from the site to and from the Caltrain station there are sidewalks along El Camino Real and
31st Avenue. There are crosswalks with pedestrian signals at the intersection of El Camino Real/31st Avenue to
facilitate crossing to the station.

Existing Lane Configurations and Traffic Volumes
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained from field observations and previous
traffic impact analyses in the study area (see Figure 5). Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new manual
peak-hour turning-movement counts (see Figure 6). The northbound volumes at the intersection of Edison Street
and 31st Avenue include northbound traffic from Edison Street and traffic from West Sailer Drive. New traffic
counts are included in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions show that all of the signalized
study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service during the PM peak hours of traffic (see
Table 3). The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersections is provided for informational purposes
only, as the City does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. The unsignalized study
intersections currently operate at LOS C or better. The level of service for the four-way stop-controlled
intersections is the level of service based on the average delay for all the intersection approaches.
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.

Background Conditions
This chapter describes background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions with the addition of traffic
from approved but not constructed projects in the area. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise
volumes from the existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by approved projects in the vicinity of the site. This
chapter describes the procedure used to determine approved traffic volumes and the resulting traffic conditions.

Background Traffic Volumes & Transportation Network
The transportation network under background conditions is assumed to be the same as the existing
transportation network. The Railroad Corridor Plan includes the extension of 28th Avenue and 31st Avenue under
the Caltrain railroad tracks to connect with Delaware Street. However, these extensions are not fully funded, so
their construction cannot be assumed in the near term.
Background traffic volumes were estimated for the project completion year by adding traffic from approved but
not yet completed developments in the project area (see Figure 7). Projects that have been approved by the City
of San Mateo but that are not yet constructed or occupied could add traffic to one or more of the study
intersections. The approved developments included in this study are listed below.

       Bay Meadows II Phase I: 1,250 dwelling units and 580,000 square feet of office development.
       2000 S. Delaware Street Phase II: unoccupied 60 apartments
Only Phase 1 of the Bay Meadows II development is included in the background because the remainder of the
project cannot be built until the 28th Avenue and 31st Avenue extensions are built. Background conditions traffic
volumes are shown on Figure 7. These approved trips are tabulated in the Volume Summary Tables in Appendix
B.

Background Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing and background conditions are
summarized in Table 4. The results show that all of the signalized study intersections would operate within the
adopted level of service standard. The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.
The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersections is provided for informational purposes only, as the
City does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. The unsignalized study
intersections would continue to operate under approved conditions at mid-level LOS D or better.

Project Traffic Conditions
This chapter describes the existing plus project and background plus project conditions. Existing plus project
traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were to be occupied prior to the other approved projects in
the area.
This chapter provides a description of the transportation system under project conditions and the method by
which project traffic is estimated. It also summarizes project traffic conditions and describes any impacts caused
by the project.

Transportation Network Under Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under project conditions, including roadways and
intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under existing conditions.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would appear are
estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In
determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is estimated for the AM,
PM, and Saturday peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of the directions to and
from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project trips are assigned to specific
streets and intersections. These procedures are described below.

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate trip making to building size for various land
use types. For many types of land use there are standard trip generation rates that can be applied to help predict
the future traffic increases that would result from a new development. The standard trip generation rates are
published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition.
The ITE land use types that are applicable to the proposed project are Shopping Center (ITE land use code 820)
and Multiplex Movie Theater (ITE category 445). The proposed new cinema would be a 10 screen multiplex
theater. To be conservative, Friday PM peak hour rates were used to estimate the trips generated by the
proposed cinema. This represents a worst-case scenario because the Friday PM peak hour trip generation rates
are about 67% higher than the regular weekday PM peak hour rates.
Based on the ITE trip rates, it is estimated that the proposed shopping center redevelopment would generate
2,474 new daily vehicle trips, with 185 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour (see Table 5). The proposed


                                                                                                       Page | 19

project would generate fewer trips during the AM peak hour than the existing development. This is because the
amount of general retail space would be reduced, and the movie theaters would not be open in the morning. .

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution pattern was assumed based on the driveway counts of the existing shopping center. The
driveway counts indicate how much traffic uses 29th Avenue, 30th Avenue, 31st Avenue, Edison Street, Hacienda
Street, and El Camino Real to get to and from the Hillsdale Shopping Center. The peak hour trips generated by
the project were assigned to the roadway network in accordance with the existing trip distribution pattern. The
weekday trip distribution patterns and project trips assignment at the study intersections during the PM peak
hours are shown on Figure 8.

Project Condition Traffic Volumes
Project impacts were evaluated relative to both (1) existing traffic volumes and (2) background traffic volumes.
For the existing plus project scenario, projected peak hour traffic volumes with the project were estimated by
adding the net new trips generated by the proposed project to existing traffic volumes. For the background plus
project scenario, projected peak hour traffic volumes with the project were estimated by adding the net new trips
generated by the proposed project to background traffic volumes. The project condition traffic volumes at the
study intersections for each scenario are shown in Figures 9 and 10.

Project Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis for the (1) existing plus project and (2) background plus
project scenarios are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. It should be noted that, at some study intersections, the
average delay under project conditions is shown to be better than under no project conditions. This occurs
because the intersection delay is a weighted average of all intersection movements. The addition of project
traffic to movements with delays lower than the average intersection delay (such as right turns) can reduce the
average delay for the entire intersection.
The results of the level of service calculations show that under existing plus project conditions, all of the study
intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of service (see Chapter 1 for LOS standards and
impact criteria).

Project Alternative Analysis
An alternative to the original site plan was proposed to construct a roundabout at the intersection of Edison
Street/West Sailer Drive and 31st Avenue and to install a traffic signal at the intersection of East Sailer Drive and
31st Avenue (see Figure 11). The inclusion of a round-about would reduce the overall number of parking spaces
for the whole shopping from 5,456 to 4,987 spaces which would still exceed the required 4,449 parking spaces.
Hexagon did not count traffic at the intersection of East Sailer Drive and 31st Avenue. The northbound right turn
volume from East Sailer Drive is assumed to be 100 vehicles during the PM peak hour. The other movement
volumes were estimated based on the volumes at the adjacent intersections.
With a traffic signal, the East Sailer Drive and 31st Avenue intersection would operate at LOS B during the PM
peak hour under both existing plus project and background plus project conditions (see Appendix C). The round-
about analysis at the intersection of Edison Street/West Sailer Drive and 31st Avenue shows that a one-lane
round-about would operate with acceptable delay of 4.8 seconds and LOS A during the PM peak hour under
both existing plus project and background plus project conditions.

Cumulative 2030 traffic conditions were evaluated for the AM and PM peak hours. The 2030 AM and PM peak
hour traffic volumes at the signalized study intersections were obtained from the City of San Mateo General Plan
2030 model. 2030 volumes for the unsignalized study intersections were estimated based on the 2030 forecast
volumes at nearby intersections. The 2030 roadway network includes connections and grade separations
between El Camino Real and Delaware Street at 28th Avenue and 31st Avenue. The Hillsdale Shopping Center
redevelopment and expansion project is included in the 2030 General Plan forecasts. Cumulative conditions
traffic volumes with the project were analyzed and are shown on Figure 12.

Intersection Levels of Service Under 2030 Cumulative Conditions
The intersection levels of service under 2030 Cumulative Conditions are summarized in Table 8. The level of
service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C. The results show that all of the signalized study
intersections would operate within the City’s adopted level of service standard under 2030 conditions with the
project. However, the project would, as a result of its contribution to cumulative increases in traffic, be required to
pay its fair share to the City of San Mateo Traffic Impact Fee.
Impact:          The project will contribute to the growth in cumulative traffic demand. Intersection improvements
                 identified in the City of San Mateo Traffic Mitigation Report will be required to maintain
                 intersection levels of service within the adopted standards at some intersections.
Mitigation:      The project will be required to pay Traffic Impact Fees based on the cumulative traffic increase.
The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersections is provided for informational purposes only, as the
City does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. The level of service for the four-way
stop-controlled intersections is the level of service based on the average delay for the intersection approaches.
The results show that the unsignalized intersections would operate at LOS C or better.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the proposed development
including:
       Bike, pedestrian and transit analysis,
       Signal warrant analysis,
       Site access and circulation review, and
       Parking.
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is specified in the San Mateo General Plan, the analyses
in this chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by
the traffic engineering community.

Pedestrians, Bicycles and Transit
Pedestrian Access
Pedestrian traffic would be generated by trips between the north and south parts of the shopping center, trips to
nearby transit stops, and trips to nearby businesses and residential areas. Currently, there are five crosswalks
connecting the north and south parts of the shopping center on the ground level and one connection on the
second level (through the food court). The proposed site plan shows the same connections between the
redeveloped north part and south part of the shopping center. There also will be pedestrian traffic between the
project site and the nearby bus stops on El Camino Real. El Camino Real has sidewalks on both sides of the
street. The project proposes four new pedestrian connections to access El Camino Real: two new pedestrian
paths and two sidewalks along the vehicle entrance aisle. In addition, some pedestrian traffic could be generated
by residential areas accessed from 31st Avenue, 29th Avenue, and Edison Street. All of these streets have
sidewalks.
The pedestrian traffic using the crosswalk at 31st Avenue and East Sailer Road would increase with the new
cinema and retail stores. Currently, there are stop signs at the shopping center driveway and East Sailer Drive,
but the approaches along 31st Avenue are uncontrolled. It is recommended that a four-way stop or a traffic signal
be explored for this intersection to reduce pedestrian delays, reduce potential vehicle queuing, and improve
pedestrian safety.

Bicycle Access
The project is located along El Camino Real, which is suitable only for experienced bicycle riders because of the
speed and volume of traffic. However, the San Mateo bicycle network provides other north-south bicycle routes
parallel to El Camino Real that are suitable for novice riders. Alameda de las Pulgas is a designated bicycle


                                                                                                  Page | 31 
Hillsdale Shopping Center North Block Development                                                November 19, 2015 
 
route that runs north-south through the city to the west of the shopping center. Connections to/from the center
and Alameda de las Pulgas are available via proposed designated bike routes on 28th Avenue, 31st Avenue, and
an existing designated bike route on Hillsdale Boulevard. Portions of Hillsdale Boulevard have striped bike lanes.
There are two other north-south bike routes west of the center: an existing designated bike route on Hacienda
Street and a proposed designated bike route on Flores Street/Edison Street. In general, the streets west of the
shopping center are two-lane residential streets that are suitable for bicycling.
To the east of the shopping center, another north-south bicycle route exists on Delaware Street/Pacific
Boulevard. This corridor has been designated as the primary north-south bikeway through San Mateo.
Connections to the shopping center from Delaware Street/Pacific Boulevard are available via designated bike
routes on 25th Avenue and Hillsdale Boulevard. With full development of the Railroad Corridor Plan, 28th Avenue
and 31st Avenue will be connected under the Caltrain tracks to Delaware Street. These will provide additional
bicycle connections to the Delaware Street primary north-south bikeway.
The San Mateo Bicycle Plan has the following to say about a bike connection on 31st Avenue between Edison
Street and El Camino Real: “The existing right-of-way on 31st Avenue between Edison and El Camino Real is too
narrow to fit a bike path or bike lane …A bike route is not recommended because the existing high traffic
volumes and high number of turning movements will not serve bicyclists of all skill levels.” The plan makes the
following recommendation: “if feasible, support the development of new bicycle facilities on 31st Avenue in
conjunction with redevelopment of that portion of the Hillsdale Shopping Center.” The current proposed
reconfiguration of the center brings into question that recommendation from the bike plan.
The San Mateo Planning and Public Works departments have met and discussed the issue of accommodating
bikes on 31st Avenue in conjunction with the shopping center reconfiguration. It was determined that bike lanes
or a bike route would be undesirable because of all the cars turning on and off El Camino Real and turning in
and out of the shopping center parking lots. Even with bike lanes, this section of 31st Avenue would not be
suitable for all skill levels. Also, once bikes got to El Camino Real, there are no bicycle facilities for them to
continue their journey. El Camino Real is not suitable for riders of all abilities. For these reasons, city staff is
recommending that 28th Avenue be the bike connection to, and eventually across, El Camino Real.

Transit Access
Currently, there are a total nine bus routes serving the project area. The closest bus stops, which are located on
El Camino Real or on 31st Avenue are all within walking distance to the project site. Commuter rail service is
provided by Caltrain. There are sidewalks and crosswalks connecting the project site and the nearby Hillsdale
Caltrain station, which is about a 950 foot walk south of the project site. The best connection to the Hillsdale
Caltrain station is via the sidewalks on El Camino Real and then the signalized crosswalks at 31st Avenue. Once
onto the shopping center site, there are sidewalks along 31st Avenue that lead directly to shopping center
entrances. It is expected that the new ridership generated by the proposed project could be accommodated by
the existing transit service provided in the project vicinity.

Signal Warrant Analysis
The intersections of Hacienda Street/31st Avenue, Edison Street/31st Avenue, and Edison Street/Hillsdale
Boulevard are currently under all-way stop control. The level of service analysis at these intersection showed
that all of them would operate at acceptable levels of service under all conditions. Signal warrant analyses were
performed based on the peak-hour turning-movement volumes projected at these intersections. The analysis
concluded that the projected peak-hour traffic volumes would not warrant signalization at the intersections of
Hacienda Street/31st Avenue and Edison Street/31st Avenue (see Appendix C for calculations). The peak hour
signal warrant check at the intersection of Street/Hillsdale Boulevard shows the a signal currently is justified and
would be justified with the addition of project generated traffic on the basis of existing and project PM peak hour
traffic volumes.

Site Access and Circulation
Site Access
Access to the project site will be changed only slightly from existing conditions. The site will continue to function
with two right-turn only driveways on El Camino Real. The driveway adjacent to the Wells Fargo Bank will be
redesigned to provide a more prominent access point to the shopping center. The three existing full-access
driveways along 31st Avenue will remain at their current locations. The total width of the driveway at the
intersection of Edison Street and 31st Avenue will be narrowed by removing the existing center island. This
change will improve alignment and reduce the size of the intersection. The access to the north side parking
structure from Edison Street and the access to the upper deck of the parking garage from 30th Avenue will
remain unchanged.
In the future the Hillsdale Caltrain station is planned to be moved north so that it lies between 28th and 31st
Avenues. San Mateo has prepared a Hillsdale Station Area Plan to show reconfiguration of station access when
the station is moved. The plan calls for a parking garage and driveway opposite the north block of the Hillsdale
Shopping Center. The planned driveway location is directly opposite the existing Wells Fargo Bank building. The
Hillsdale Station Area Plan calls for a signalized southbound left turn and crosswalks to be installed on El
Camino Real to facilitate access to the parking garage for cars and access across El Camino Real for
pedestrians.
As described below, it would be desirable to form a four-legged intersection that would provide signalized full
access to the shopping center and the Hillsdale station. This would require moving the station access from its
currently planned location. In the meantime, the proposed new El Camino Real driveway location with the north
block reconfiguration will work well with the parking lot redesign and the access to the upper parking deck. The
existing driveway location and alignment is awkward, so the proposed design is a significant improvement.
The three driveways along El Camino Real allow only right in and right out traffic. With the new cinema and new
                                                                        st
retail stores proposed at the northwest corner of El Camino Real and 31 Avenue, it is expected that most of the
northbound traffic along El Camino Real will turn left from El Camino Real to 31st Avenue and use the driveway
opposite East Sailer Drive to access the parking garage or drop off customers. Outbound traffic to northbound El
Camino Real might also use this driveway. These vehicles would have to drive across two pedestrian crosswalks
along the pedestrian spine leading to the cinema. The frequent pedestrian crossings in front of the new cinema
could cause a vehicle back up that would block the driveway. It would be necessary to monitor the crosswalk
operation once the center were open and operating. If queuing became a problem, more positive crosswalk
controls could be implemented, such as a signalized crossing.
Hexagon further recommends that San Mateo explore the option of opening up a new left turn access along El
Camino Real at the main driveway near Wells Fargo. This access would necessitate a slight change to the
Hillsdale Station Area Plan to get the two driveways to line up. Caltrans approval would be needed. There is also
a concern that a left turn at this location would encourage drivers to cut over diagonally across 3 lanes from
westbound Hillsdale Boulevard to turn left. It should be noted that these drivers would not be forced to make that
                                                                                                  st
left turn maneuver because they also have the option to simply cross El Camino Real at the 31 Avenue signal,
which is what they do today. In the long term, the slip ramp at 31 Avenue will be removed when 31st Avenue is
                                                                   st

extended under the railroad tracks.
Based on the trip generation survey, only seven and nine vehicles currently use the driveway located at 30th
Avenue during the AM peak hour and PM peak hour, respectively. The expansion of the shopping center is
estimated to add only one inbound trip during the weekday AM peak hour and two outbound trips during the
weekday PM peak hour, which would not be a noticeable change in traffic volume in the neighborhood on 30th
Avenue.

Site Circulation
With the proposed site plan, the onsite circulation will be changed. The surface parking lot adjacent to El Camino
Real between 31st Avenue and the Wells Fargo Bank will be removed and replaced with new retail stores,
restaurants, and the cinema. The site plan shows improved pedestrian access to El Camino Real with sidewalks
around the new retail stores. The area between the future retail building and Wells Fargo Bank will be restriped
and relandscaped to provide a more obvious connection to the parking structure for vehicles.
New escalators, elevators, and stairs along 31st Avenue and along El Camino Real will be provided to access the
future restaurant, food court, and Cinema on the second level. The site plan also shows new elevators and
stairs with a canopy from the surface parking lot to the upper level garage and to the upper level food count and
shops. A new entry is proposed on the upper level parking deck with accessible parking. There will be a total of
nine pedestrian entry points surrounding the reconfigured department store, cinema, and food court.
The site plan shows that the proposed new outdoor pedestrian spine connecting to the proposed cinema would
cross a main drive aisle from/to the driveway opposite East Sailer Drive. The cinema drop-off also is shown to
occur in this area (see Figure 14). It is expected that this driveway would serve a large portion of the project trips
to the shopping center. The pedestrian traffic could potentially block vehicular traffic and cause a back up at the
driveway. Therefore, it is recommended that the pedestrian crosswalks be monitored after completion of the
project. More positive crosswalk control could be implemented if problems were found to occur.
The existing loading zone, which is located under the Sears store, would remain unchanged with the project. The
loading zone is accessed via a truck tunnel opposite Edison Street.

Parking
The required parking supply is determined using the parking rates specified in the City Zoning Code. Section
27.64.160(2)(b) of the City Zoning Code requires that a Regional Shopping Center should provide 3.5 parking
spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area (GFA) and for an indoor theater parking be provided at a ratio of
1 parking stall per 5 seats. The proposed renovation and reconfiguration will bring the total square footage of the
north block to 291,519 square feet with 43,942 square feet for the new cinema, which would translate to a total
required parking supply of 1,028 parking stalls. There are 1,455 parking spaces shown on the site plan.
Therefore, the proposed parking supply ratio would exceed the minimum parking requirement.
As a result of the proposed changes to the project area, the overall shopping center parking supply would be
reduced to 5,184 parking stalls. The proposed parking ratio for the entire mall would be 4.08 spaces per 1,000
square feet (5,184 stalls/1,269.003 GSF). The alternate site plan with a round-about would reduce the overall
parking stall count to 4,987 stalls which results in a parking ratio of 3.93 spaces per 1,000 square feet.
The City of San Mateo specifies that for a regional shopping center parking be provided at a ratio of 3.5 parking
stalls per 1,000 square feet and for an indoor theater parking be provided at a ratio of 1 parking stall per 5 seats.
For the entire mall, this would translate to a total required parking supply of 4,449 parking stalls. Thus, based on
the City code, the entire shopping center would provide adequate parking.
 The City Zoning Code (Section 27.64.262) for a Regional Shopping Center requires 1 short-term bike parking
space per 10,000 s.f. and 1 long-term bike parking space per 20,000 s.f.. For indoor theaters, the City code
requires 1 short-term bike parking space per 40 fixed-seats and 1 long-term bike parking space per 80 fixed-
seats. To comply with the City code, the project would be required to provide 46 short term bike parking spaces
and 24 long term bike parking spaces. The proposed site plan shows 30 short-term bike parking spaces and 16
long-term bike spaces, which would not meet the minimum bike parking requirement.
