SUBJECT:          Snoqualmie Ridge Apartments (DevCo, Inc.) – Consistency Analysis
                  TENW Project 3479

This memorandum provides a consistency analysis of specific transportation evaluations
documented in the original Snoqualmie Ridge II EIS, Snoqualmie Ridge II FEIS, and the Snoqualmie
Ridge II ă Parcel S-21 Analysis in the context of the proposed Snoqualmie Ridge Apartment project
proposed by DevCo., Inc. on Parcel S-20. Transportation-related items included in the consistency
review:
         Overview of development assumptions on parcel S-20 in the EIS documents and Mixed
          Use Final Plan.
         Preparation of a trip generation analysis of the proposed 200-unit apartment complex
          proposed on Parcel S-20 using trip generation rates published by ITE in the Trip
          Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012.
         Documentation of current traffic volumes at the site access intersection of Snoqualmie
          Parkway and SE Jacobia Street in comparison to forecasted traffic volumes and level of
          service operations in the Snoqualmie Ridge II EIS.
         Discussion and confirmation of site access provisions in the Snoqualmie Ridge II ă Parcel S-
          21 evaluation and subsequent modification in the Mixed Use Final Plan, Condition 1.11.

Historical Context
Per Resolution 702, the City of Snoqualmie and Quadrant Corporation executed a
Development Agreement for Snoqualmie Ridge Phase II in March 2004. As part of the
approved site plan and entitled buildout of this mixed use development, a mixture of housing
types, density ranges, commercial retail uses, and other civic/institutional buildout was
considered under three different development alternatives. In the selected alternative, the
proposed development site of the Snoqualmie Ridge Apartments project was originally
evaluated assuming 160 affordable housing units through the Snoqualmie Ridge II EIS and
Development Agreement. This consistency analysis considers a consolidation of other
affordable housing units from other development areas within Snoqualmie Ridge II with an
increased buildout of this specific site to a total of 200 affordable apartment units, a net
increase of 40 units.

Transportation Consistency Analysis



Upon additional review of the SR II Mixed Use Plan, the original density assumption was
derived based on S-20 comprising 13.6 acres with a range of up to 16 dwelling units per
acre. This density range however, also had a footnote that the derived unit ranges assumed a
30 percent discount in gross acres for roads and other undevelopable areas. However, given
that are only approximately 1.5-acres of environmentally sensitive/undevelopable land on this
parcel and no dedication in through „public roadways‰ direct application of the density
allowance on Parcel S-20 without discounts translates into 193 dwelling units (12.06
developable acres X 16 units/acre). As such, the proposed unit count of 200 units does not
constitute a significant difference in overall development on Parcel S-20 nor does it exceed the
overall residential unit count for SR II Mixed Use Plan.

Project Trip Generation
Trip generation rates compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation,
9th Edition, 2012, were used to estimate p.m. peak hour traffic that would be generated by
the proposed action. Trip generation rates/equations Mid-Rise Apartments (ITE Land Use
Code 223) were used to estimate new trips generated by the proposed development under a
worse-case scenario. Table 1 summarizes estimated trip generation by the proposed action.
An estimated 1,318 weekday daily trips, 69 a.m. peak hour vehicular trips (21 entering and
48 exiting), and 85 p.m. peak hour vehicular trips (49 entering and 36 exiting) is estimated
for traffic impacts at full build-out of the project.

Attachment 1 provides a detailed summary of trip generation estimates. A comparative
analysis of trip generation with buildout of 160 apartment units in contrast to the proposed
200 apartment units is also provided in Attachment 1. As provided in Attachment 1, a net
increase of approximately 16 a.m. peak hour trips, 19 p.m. peak hour trips, and 264 daily
trips with the proposed addition of 40 apartment units.


Existing and Future Traffic Volumes
Per the City of Snoqualmie, updated traffic counts that reflect the new completed school within
Snoqualmie Ridge were conducted in November 2016. These were conducted during the
typical a.m. peak period and p.m. peak periods of adjacent street traffic (i.e., 7:00 a.m. to
9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.). Attachment 2 provides these updated traffic
counts from November 2016.

Transportation Consistency Analysis



Using existing counts, plus a background traffic growth factor of 2 percent per year and
buildout of all 200 apartment units on Parcel S-20, total entering traffic volumes during the
p.m. peak hour at the Snoqualmie Parkway and SE Jacobia Street intersection (totaling
approximately 1,921 entering vehicles) would be significantly less than those levels evaluated
and mitigated during the EIS process (totaling 3,961 entering vehicles; more than 50 percent
fewer entering trips). Furthermore, total traffic demand on the west leg of this intersection (SE
Jacobia Street west of Snoqualmie Parkway), where all development traffic associated with
buildout of the proposed Snoqualmie Ridge Apartment project would impact would be roughly
1/3 less than total demand used to evaluate and mitigate the project during the EIS.
Attachment 3 provides this comparative analysis. As such, no further traffic impact/demand
analysis is warranted or required, and the consolidation of additional apartment units would
result in traffic demands would fall significantly below those used to evaluate and mitigate
traffic demands during the EIS.

Project Site Access
Vehicular site access for the project is proposed via one site access driveway north onto
Frontier Avenue SE and a secondary fire/emergency access driveway south, near the
Snoqualmie Valley Hospital onto SE 99th Street. The secondary access driveway is a
Condition of the Resolution 907 in regard to development on Parcel S-21, and is consistent
with emergency access only controlled by bollards or other measures.

Access through the site would be provided via a main interior private roadway that would
distribute traffic to on-site parking facilities and apartment buildings. Perpendicular parking
along each of these eight additional interior roadways is proposed. The proposed interior
roadways within the development would provide adequate fire and emergency vehicle access
to the proposed residential complex with two access fire/emergency vehicle access
driveways.

As demonstrated in the Snoqualmie Ridge Apartments, Traffic Impact Study, November 1,
2016, TENW, the primary access/study intersection of Snoqualmie Parkway and SE Jacobia
Street is projected to operate at LOS B with or without the project in 2018, meeting adopted
City of Snoqualmie level of service standards.

Conclusions
As described above, the transportation consistency analysis was prepared for the proposed
Snoqualmie Ridge Apartment project in the context of the Snoqualmie Ridge II EIS documents and
SR II Mixed Use Final Plan. As the traffic volumes used to evaluate and mitigate traffic demands
for the overall Snoqualmie Ridge development would be less than 50 percent of the total entering
demands with the project at full buildout, all findings and conclusions of the EIS and subsequent
Mixed Use Final Plan conditions remain valid based on these determinations:
         With the proposed Snoqualmie Ridge Apartments project at full buildout, total project trip
          generation of 1,318 weekday daily trips, 69 a.m. peak hour vehicular trips (21
          entering and 48 exiting), and 85 p.m. peak hour vehicular trips is estimated. A net

          increase of approximately 16 a.m. peak hour trips, 19 p.m. peak hour trips, and 264
          daily trips with the proposed addition of 40 apartment units would occur over the
          previously assumed peak density of Parcel S-20.
         Total entering traffic volumes during the p.m. peak hour at the Snoqualmie Parkway
          and SE Jacobia Street intersection with the Snoqualmie Ridge Apartments project at
          200 units (totaling approximately 1,921 entering vehicles) would be significantly less
          than those levels evaluated and mitigated during the EIS process (totaling 3,961
          entering vehicles; more than 50 percent fewer entering trips). Furthermore, total traffic
          demand on the west leg of this intersection (SE Jacobia Street west of Snoqualmie
          Parkway) would be roughly 1/3 less than total demand used to evaluate and mitigate
          the project during the EIS.
         Vehicular site access for the project is proposed via one site access driveway north
          onto Frontier Avenue SE and a secondary fire/emergency access driveway south, near
          the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital onto SE 99th Street. The secondary access driveway
          is a Condition of the Resolution 907 in regard to development on Parcel S-21, and is
          consistent with emergency access only controlled by bollards or other measures.

Based on the above, it was determined that no further traffic analysis of the Snoqualmie Ridge
Apartment projects is warranted, and the project mitigation built and in-place for Snoqualmie Ridge
identified in the Snoqualmie Ridge II EIS and SR II Mixed Use Final Plan remains valid.
Furthermore, given the significant differences in total traffic demand at the primary site access
intersection of Snoqualmie Parkway and SE Jacobia Street between future conditions with the
proposed Snoqualmie Ridge Apartments project with 200 apartment units and the original
Snoqualmie Ridge II EIS, no (major or minor) modifications in the SR II Mixed Use Final plan are
triggered by traffic demands.
