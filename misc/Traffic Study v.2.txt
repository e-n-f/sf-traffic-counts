The Valdok                                                                               July 2015



                                      Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed-use building located on the on the southwest
corner of the 17th Avenue NW and NW 56th Street intersection in the Ballard neighborhood
of Seattle. As necessary, mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce
significant transportation related impacts that the project may have on the surrounding
transportation system.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the southwest corner of the 17th Avenue NW and NW
56th Street intersection. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed project site and the surrounding
vicinity. The development would construct a residential building consisting of approximately
176 multifamily dwelling units as well as 10,284 square-feet of live-work units on the ground
floor and 3,917 square-feet of retail space. The existing uses on site which include residential
buildings and parking will be removed with the project. On-site parking for the residential uses
will be provided in a below-grade garage with approximately 163 stalls. A preliminary site
plan for the development is shown on Figure 2. It is anticipated the development would be
completed and occupied by 2018.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis is based on previous on coordination with City of Seattle DPD
staff. Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed project, the following
intersections were selected for analysis:
    1. 20th Avenue NW / NW 56th Street
    2. 17th Avenue NW / NW 56th Street
    3. 20th Avenue NW / NW Market Street
    4. 17th Avenue NW / NW Market Street
    5. 15th Avenue NW / NW Market Street

The study intersections along NW 56th Street are all-way stop controlled intersections
whereas the intersections along NW Market Street are controlled by a traffic signal.

The scope fo the analysis included a review of the existing, without and with-project
conditions. Impacts on the transportation system are measured through a comparison of the
without and with-project conditions. The analysis focused on a review of the following
elements:

        Planned improvements (pedestrian, bicycle, transit)
        Changes in traffic volumes
        Intersection operations
        Traffic Safety
        Parking demands

      Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes both existing and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
identified study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the roadway network and
planned improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, transit service, and non-motorized facilities.


Roadway Network
The following sections describe the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed
project and any anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.

Existing Inventory
Characteristics of the existing street network in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the streets adjacent to the site are two lane
facilities with relatively low travel volumes. NW Market Street and 15th Avenue NW are both
4 - 6 lane roadways, providing arterial access. The street system in the vicinity of the site
provides pedestrian and bicycle connections as well as parking.

Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2014 – 2019 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) no transportation projects were identified and are anticipated to be completed by 2018
that may affect vehicle travel patterns in the project vicinity.




                                                                                                      Page 8

Traffic Volumes
The following sections document the development of the traffic volumes used in the existing
and future without-project operations analysis.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown in
Figure 3. Traffic counts were collected at the study intersections in March 2015. Detailed
intersection traffic counts are provided in Appendix A. Traffic volumes were rounded to the
nearest five vehicles as weekday volumes fluctuate day-to-day due to various conditions.

Future Without-Project Volumes
Future horizon year (2018) without-project volumes were estimated by growing the existing
weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes by an annual growth rate and adding in project trips
from other developments in the project vicinity. Typically, to account for smaller development
in the area and for general background growth in traffic volumes, an annual growth rate of
1.51 percent is added to the existing intersection traffic volumes; however, in this case a
larger annual background growth of 2.52 percent was used to account for the anticipated
growth from Expedia moving along Elliott Avenue W. Traffic from ten pipeline projects in the
project vicinity were also included in the future without-project volume forecasts including:
       1. 1537 NW 56th St
       2. 5343 Tallman Ave NW
       3. 5601 20th Ave NW
       4. 1731 NW 57th St
       5. 2014 NW 57th St
       6. 2018 NW 57th St
       7. 1760 NW 56th St
       8. 2003 NW 57th St
       9. 5601 22nd Ave NW
       10. 1448 NW Market St

Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes used in the future without-project analysis are
shown in Figure 4.




1
    A 1.5 percent annual background growth rate is consistent with previously approved traffic studies in the area.
2
    The 2.5 percent annual background growth rate assumes 3,000 additional Expedia employees with a mode split of
      55 percent by vehicle and 20 percent of trips to/from the north based on OntheMap.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations and all-way stop controlled
intersections, LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle and is reported for the
intersections as a whole. Traffic operations for an intersection can be described
alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-
flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B
contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Results are summarized in Table 2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis
are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, during the weekday PM peak hour all of the study intersections
currently operate at LOS B or better during both existing conditions and 2018 without-project
conditions with the exception of the 15th Avenue NW / NW Market Street intersection. The
15th Avenue NW / NW Market Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS D under
existing conditions and to degrade to LOS E under without-project conditions.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify any existing traffic
safety issues at the study intersections. The most recent three year summary of accident
data from SDOT is for the period between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. In
addition to the intersections, collision data along the roadways fronting the project were
analyzed to evaluate the safety of the project driveways and pedestrian/bicycle safety. This
information is summarized in Table 3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high accident location status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. As shown in Table 3, the stop-
controlled intersections average less than one collision per year and the signalized
intersections average approximately seven or fewer collisions per year. Based on this data,
none of the study intersections meet the High Accident Location criteria.

None of the collisions during the three year period had fatalities or involved a bicyclist. There
were 5 reported collisions that involved a pedestrian, 3 at 15th Avenue NW and 2 at 20th
Avenue NW along NW Market Street.

                                            Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
roadway network and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated by the
proposed project are distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within
the study area for the weekday PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-
project traffic volumes and the potential impact to traffic operations and the City’s
transportation concurrency program are identified. Site-specific items are also discussed
such as the traffic operations of the site’s alley access and estimated on-site parking
demand.


Trip Generation
In order to estimate the proposed project’s trip generation, weekday daily and PM peak hour
person trip rates were estimated for the proposed land uses. Initial vehicle trip rates were
identified using the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th
Edition, 2012). The methodology used in this analysis has been approved by City staff and is
consistent with previous studies conducted in the area. The flow chart below illustrates the
trip generation process.

Some ITE land uses represent vehicle trip rates observed in more suburban settings than the
proposed project. To calibrate the trip generation to the local character of the proposed
project, the vehicle trips based on ITE trip rates are converted to person trips through the use
of average vehicle occupancy (AVO) rates derived from NCHRP Report 365. Once person
trips were derived, local mode split information, from American Community Survey (ACS)
data3 was applied to arrive at transit, non-motorized, carpool and single occupant vehicles
(SOV) trips.

Person trips by mode were determined by multiplying the person trips by the estimated mode
splits. For the purpose of developing a conservative trip generation estimate, live work units
were considered as both a dwelling unit and as a specialty retail area. Table 4 shows the
resulting weekday daily and PM peak hour vehicle trip generation. Detailed trip generation
calculations for the proposed development are provided in Appendix D.

As shown in the Table 4, the development is anticipated to generate 880 new vehicular
weekday daily trips with 75 trips occurring during the weekday PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
The weekday PM peak hour vehicular trips associated with the project were distributed to the
roadway network based on data from the Census Bureau4 regarding where residents within
the surrounding vicinity of the project site travel to work, and localized travel patterns Figure 5
depicts the assumed inbound and outbound trip distribution to the surrounding local and
regional street system. The weekday PM peak hour trips were assigned to the study area
based on the travel patterns and the location of the site access as shown in Figure 5.

Near the proposed development, project trips were assigned to the roadway network based
on local circulation patterns and restrictions. It was assumed the majority of vehicle trips
during the weekday PM peak hour would travel to the residential parking garage, accessed in
the alley between NW Market Street and NW 56th Street along 17th Avenue NW and the
remaining would use the alley access along 20th Avenue NW.

The project generated traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour
traffic volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2018 with-project
traffic volumes are shown on Figure 6.

As shown in Table 5, the traffic volume impacts are relatively low at the offsite intersections.
The traffic volumes are anticipated to increase by approximately 3 percent or less. The
greatest volume impact would occur along 17th Avenue NW at NW Market Street and NW
56th Street due to the proximity to the site access and the localized circulation patterns.


Traffic Operations Impact
A future with-project level-of-service analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour
to analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methodologies were applied as
described for existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters
such as channelization and intersection control were consistent with those used in the
evaluation of future without-project conditions. A comparison of 2018 horizon year future
without-project and future with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is
summarized in Table 6. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

During the weekday PM peak hour, the addition of with-project traffic would result in nominal
increases in delay at the study intersections. All offsite intersections are forecast to operate at
the same LOS in without-project as with-project conditions. Average vehicle delay is
anticipated to increase by 2 seconds or less at each of the study intersections. The midblock
alley that serves as access to the project garage is anticipated to operate at LOS B during the
weekday PM peak hour.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The

system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that were
analyzed for concurrency review include Ship Canal Ballard Bridge (Screenline 5.11), South
of NW 80th Street (Screenline 6.11), and West of Aurora Bridge (Screenline 7.11), as shown
in Table 7. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic
traveling in the direction of the screenline would extend across the screenline included in the
analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenlines would have v/c ratios less than the City v/c threshold; thus, the project would
meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
demand of the project, and parking code requirements.

Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by an on-site parking garage with a total
of 163 stalls. Access to the parking garage would be provided via the alley way NW Market
Street and NW 56th Street. Additionally, 48 bicycle parking stalls will be provided.

Demand
An analysis was completed to estimate the approximate on-site peak parking demand of the
proposed development accounting for each land use’s different time of peak parking demand
over the course of a typical day. The peak parking demand is expected to be below national
averages due the project’s proximity to transit service located within the Ballard Hub Urban
Village. The peak parking demand for the proposed project was estimated based on data
provided in ITE Parking Generation (4th Edition), Urban Land Institute’s Shared Parking (2nd
Edition), local mode of travel data consistent with the trip generation analysis, and local
vehicle ownership data.5 This approach is consistent with approved traffic studies conducted
in the area. Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix E.

Parking demand for the residential component of the project was reviewed based on US
Census data related to vehicle ownership consistent with the trip generation method. The site

is located in census tract 47; this area is located north of the ship canal between 24th and 8th
Avenue NW.

The parking garage is anticipated to be utilized by residents of the development only. As
such, customers of the retail space and residential guests are anticipated to utilize off-street
or off-street public lots. As a result, the residential peak and the customer and guest peak
parking demand were looked at separately.

Retail and Residential Guests Parking Demand
Peak parking demand for the retail components was calculated using ITE Parking Generation
(4th Edition, 2010). The same vehicle reduction taken for the trip generation was applied to
the parking demand calculation for retail as the retail uses are anticipated to be local uses
that attract shorter trips that include walking, bicycling, and transit. Based on the proposed
retail land use, a localized parking rate of 1.4 vehicles per 1,000 square feet was developed,
which results in a peak parking demand of 20 vehicles. 6

A peak visitor parking demand rate of 0.15 vehicles per unit was assumed based on data
provided in Shared Parking, resulting in a total of 26 visitors. The demand rate is based on a
suburban multifamily apartment setting and is likely conservative based on the proximity of
transit and bicycle facilities to the proposed project.

As stated above, the guests of the residential guests and retail customers would not be able
to park on-site and instead utilize off-street parking lots. The peak parking demand of the
retail and guests was determined based on the hourly parking demand rate distribution
throughout a typical weekday provided in Shared Parking, shown in Table 9.

As shown in Figure 7, the retail and guest parking are anticipated to peak at 7 p.m. with an
estimated demand of 46 spaces. The on-street parking and off-street parking lots were
surveyed at 7 p.m. to accommodate the retail and residential guests. An on-street parking
utilization study was conducted to determine the available on-street parking supply and
parking demand within 800 and 1,000 feet walking distance of the project site. The study
spanned from 20th Avenue NE to 15th Avenue NW and NW 60th Street to NW 52nd Street.

2.       From SDOT parking study, collected 5/30/2014 from 6:30-8:30 p.m.


As shown in Table 8, within 800’ there are 67 available spaces in off-street parking lots and
within 1,000 feet there are 485 free spaces. This shows that the off-site parking lots can
accommodate the retail and guest parking peak parking demand of 45 vehicles.

Resident Parking Demand
The residential parking was also estimated. The peak parking demand for the apartment uses
are expected to be below national averages due the project’s proximity to transit service and
its location in a high-density urban center with a strong mix of office, residential, and
commercial spaces. The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the
apartments is based on average vehicle ownership7 from US Census data. Based on the
proposed mix of apartment units,8 a parking rate of 0.94 vehicles per dwelling unit was used
for tenants, which results in a parking demand of 165 vehicles for residents.

The resident parking is anticipated to peak overnight. Given that the peak residential parking
demand is 165 vehicles and the proposed supply is 163 spaces, there is anticipated to be a
spillover over approximately 2 vehicles that will need to be accommodated off-site. An on-
street parking utilization study was conducted to determine the available on-street parking
supply and parking demand within 800 and 1,000 feet walking distance of the project site.
The study spanned from 20th Avenue NE to 15th Avenue NW and NW 60th Street to NW
52nd Street. A detailed summary of this study is provided in Appendix F and a map of the on-
street parking study area is shown in Figure 8. Table 9 provides a summary of the results of
the parking utilization study.

1.   Estimated on-street parking spaces based on standard SDOT procedures for measurements April 2015.
2.   Based on an average of two days of data collection.
3.   Number of spaces that the residents of the proposed project would occupy based on demand calculations.


As shown in Table 9, the residents of the proposed project could be accommodated within
both 800 feet and 1,000 feet of the site. Note that although the resident are anticipated to be
accommodated in on-street parking, there are also many off-street parking lots in the area
discussed above that can accommodate the resident parking spillover.

Displaced Parking
The project would removes parking associated with the existing uses and as such the
demand for those spaces is being removed.

Parking Code Analysis
This section outlines the parking code requirements for vehicular and bicycle parking.

Off-Street Vehicle Parking
As noted previously, the project includes 163 garage parking spaces for the residential and
retail uses. Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there is no minimum parking
requirement the development as it is located within the Ballard Hub Urban Village and is
within 1,320 feet of a street with frequent transit service (see Appendix G).

Bicycle Parking
Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists

reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

SMC Section 23.54.015, Table E outlines the bicycle parking siting and quantity
requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for short-term
(less than 4 hours) and long-term (more than 4 hours). For the apartment use, no short-term
bicycle parking is required and 1 space for every 4 apartment units is required long-term use.
This results in 44 long-term bicycle spaces. The code requires 1 long-term bicycle parking
space for every 12,000 square feet of retail and 1 short-term parking space for every 4,000
square feet of retail. This results in 1 long-term bicycle parking space required and 3 short-
term bicycle parking space requirements. The combine uses result in a requirement of 45
long-term and 3 short-term bicycle parking spaces. Since the vehicular parking for this project
is provided in a covered, below-grade garage all long-term bicycle parking must also be
covered.

                                 Mitigation Summary
The project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018. Based on the operation
analyses at the study intersections and the low impacts that project traffic has on the
surrounding street network, it is anticipated that the existing infrastructure surrounding the
proposed project will be sufficient to accommodate the off-site vehicles, transit, and non-
motorized trips generated by the proposed development with negligible impacts in the study
area. Given the traffic and parking impacts identified in this report, no off-site mitigation
measures would be necessary to offset the transportation related impacts of the project.

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with of the mixed-use
development located at the southwest corner of the NE 56th Street / 17th Avenue NE
intersection in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. General findings and recommendations
include:

     The proposed project would develop up to 176 apartment units along with 10,284
         square-feet of live-work units on the ground floor and 3,917 square-feet of retail
         space. This development is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018.
          After accounting for the existing uses on the project site, the development is
           anticipated to generate 880 net new vehicular weekday daily trips, with 75 new trips
           occurring during the weekday PM peak hour.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via the alley between
           NW 56th Street and NW Market Street along 17th Avenue NW. The alley site
           access would operate at LOS B during the weekday PM peak hour with the addition
           of project generated traffic. The off-site study intersection intersections would
           continue to operate at same LOS during the weekday PM peak hour for future
           conditions without and with the project.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The proposed parking garage with a minimum of 163 vehicle parking stalls would
           accommodate the majority of the residents and the remaining would be able to park
           on-street or in off-street parking lots. Visitors and retail customers to the proposed
           development would be accommodated in adjacent on-street parking or public, off-
           street lots.
          No off-site mitigation measures would be required to offset the transportation
           related impacts of the project.

Appendix B:   LOS Definitions
Highway Capacity Manual, 2010

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying
several intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time.
Specifically, LOS criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified
time period (for example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on
many variables, including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the
intersection), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity.
Table 1 shows LOS criteria for signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010).

Table 1. Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections
    Level of        Average Control Delay          General Description
    Service               (sec/veh)                (Signalized Intersections)
        A                      10                 Free Flow
        B                   >10 - 20               Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                   >20 - 35               Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                          Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait
                            >35 - 55
                                                   through more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                   >55 - 80               Unstable flow (intolerable delay)
        F                      >80                 Forced flow (jammed)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types:
all-way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS
is expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of
a signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a
two-way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual
movements, rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-
controlled intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total
average vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized
intersections (both all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).
