Subject:        2401 3rd Avenue Transportation/Parking Analysis (DPD # 3021375)

This memorandum summarizes the transportation and parking analysis completed for the proposed
residential and retail project located at 2401 3rd Avenue in Seattle, WA. The scope of this analysis
was coordinated with City of Seattle staff. The proposed development plan, anticipated trip
generation, review of access operations, and anticipated peak parking demand are reviewed.


Project Description
The project is located at 2401 3rd Avenue on the northwest side of Battery Street. The site is
currently occupied by a bank that is approximately 7,800 square feet (sf) with a drive-through and
associated parking. Existing access is provided by driveways located on 3rd Avenue and Battery
Street.

The proposed project includes the construction of residential and retail uses with up to 134
residential apartment units and approximately 5,000 sf of ground floor retail. Site access would be
consolidated to the alley between Wall Street and Battery Street located at the northwestern property
line of the site. Up to 73 parking spaces would be provided. The project is anticipated to be
constructed and occupied by 2018. The first floor site plan is shown on Figure 1.

Transportation Network
The following provides a summary of the key roadways in the vicinity of the site.

2nd Avenue is classified as a principal arterial by the City of Seattle and accommodates one-way
southbound travel. Parking is allowed on both sides of the street near the project site. Sidewalks are
provided along both sides of the street within the vicinity of the project site and a dedicated bike lane
with a signed bike route is also provided along 2nd Avenue.

3rd Avenue is classified as a minor arterial by the City of Seattle and accommodates two-way traffic
with on-street parking on both sides of the street. Sidewalks are also provided on both sides of the
street with marked crosswalks at Wall Street and Battery Street. No bicycle facilities are provided.

Wall Street is classified as a principal arterial from Denny Way to 2nd Avenue and a minor arterial
from 2nd Avenue to Alaskan Way by the City of Seattle. It accommodates one-way traffic southwest-
bound with on-street parking on both sides of the street. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of
the street with marked crosswalks at 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue. No bicycle facilities are provided.

                                                                                                       2
Battery Street is classified as a principal arterial by the City of Seattle and accommodates one-way
travel northeast-bound. On-street parking is provided on both sides of the street. Sidewalk is
provided on both sides of the street with marked crosswalks at 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue. No
bicycle facilities are provided.


Transit
King County Metro operates approximately 39 routes in the area with 18 stops within a 1/4-mile
radius of the proposed project. Transit stops are located along 3rd Avenue approximately two blocks
south and two blocks north of the project site. Just outside of the 1/4-mile radius, bus stops along
Lenora Street, 3rd Avenue, and 4th Avenue provide access to seven Sound Transit routes traveling
north, east, and south. The entire region is easily accessible from this site via transit.


Trip Generation
Trip generation estimates have been prepared for the project based on trip rates identified using the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (2012) and
consideration for average vehicle occupancies and mode splits typical of the Belltown neighborhood.
This methodology has been approved by City staff and is consistent with previous studies conducted
in the area.

Some ITE land uses represent vehicle trip rates observed in more suburban settings than the
proposed project. To calibrate the trip generation to the local character of the proposed project, the
vehicle trips based on ITE trip rates are converted to person trips through the use of average vehicle
occupancy (AVO) rates derived from NCHRP Report 365. Once person trips were derived, local
mode split information was applied to arrive at transit, non-motorized, carpool and single occupant
vehicles (SOV) trips. Person trips by mode were determined by multiplying the person trips by the
estimated mode splits.

The basis of residential trip generation was ITE land-use code 220 (Apartment) and mode splits
from the American Community Survey (ACS) data 1 for the Belltown neighborhood. The proposed
retail trip generation was based on ITE land-use code 826 (Specialty Retail Center) due to the
proposed small size and neighborhood serving use. The retail would serve the local area including
residents and employees living and working nearby. This would result in a high proportion of walking
trips to and from the surrounding neighborhood. The analysis assumes that 10 percent of the retail
customers would drive to the site.

Table 1 summarizes the resulting net new weekday daily, AM, and PM peak hour vehicle trip
generation. Trip credits for the existing uses were estimated using a similar method as described
above. Detailed trip generation calculations for the proposed development are provided in
Attachment A.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in the Table 1, the development is anticipated to generate fewer trips than the existing
drive-in bank, resulting in a net decrease of -70 weekday daily trips, -11 weekday AM peak hour
trips and -46 weekday PM peak hours trips.


Driveway Evaluation
Garage access is proposed off the existing alley between Wall Street and Battery Street. Traffic
operations at the site access were evaluated for the weekday PM peak hour period. Future 2018
traffic volumes were forecast by increasing existing traffic counts 2 along Battery Street and Wall
Street by 1.5-percent per year as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline” development
projects that would increase background traffic and adding project generated traffic. This growth
rate was determined from previous studies conducted in the area and coordinated with City of
Seattle staff.3

The following six pipeline projects were considered in the area:

              3031 Western Avenue                                                      2200 7th Avenue
              2202 8th Avenue                                                          2116 4th Avenue
              2200 Western Avenue                                                      2100 7th Avenue

Project trips were assigned to the driveway turning movements based on the roadway network in
the project vicinity and existing work travel patterns of residents living within 1/4 mile of the site. 4 It
is anticipated that traffic associated with the development would travel to/from the south along 2nd
Avenue, 3rd Avenue, and 5th Avenue. The total proposed project traffic was then added to 2018
weekday PM peak hour background traffic volumes to estimate traffic volumes at the site access
driveway under buildout conditions as shown on Figure 2.

Intersection level of service (LOS) for future with-project conditions were evaluated at the site access
driveway using the Synchro 9 software program based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM, 2010). At side-street stop-controlled intersections such as access
driveways, LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour of traffic and is
reported for the worst operating movement of the intersection. Attachment C provides a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Access to the alley at Wall Street is anticipated to operate at LOS C with 19 seconds of delay and
the access to the alley at Battery Street is anticipated to operate at LOS B with 12 seconds of delay.
A detailed LOS worksheet is included in Attachment D.


Parking Analysis
An analysis of the parking code requirements, the proposed parking supply, and the anticipated
demand for the proposed project was completed. The following sections describe parking supply
requirements under the City of Seattle parking code, the proposed parking supply, and the estimated
peak parking demand of the project.



                                                                                                      5
Parking Code Requirements
Auto Parking Requirements. The project includes 73 parking spaces for the residential and
retail uses. Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there is no minimum parking
requirement for development located within the Belltown Urban Center.

Bicycle Parking Requirements. SMC Section 23.49.019, Table A outlines the bicycle parking
siting and quantity requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces
for residential, retail, and office uses. Bicycle paring is not required for retail uses under 10,000
square feet. Required bicycle parking rate is reduced in half after the first 50 parking spaces
provided per land use. The bicycle parking requirements are shown in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, the project would be required to provide 59 bicycle spaces. The project is
proposing to supply 63 bicycle parking spaces, which would exceed the required bicycle parking
supply. Additionally, the project is proposing an on-sidewalk bike storage rack, which could be
utilized for short-term bicycle parking.

On-Site Parking Supply
The proposed project would provide on-site parking for 73 below-grade parking stalls. The parking
garage would be accessed via a driveway on the alley between 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue
connecting Wall Street and Battery Street. The existing on-site parking stalls would be removed as
part of the proposed project.

Parking Demand
Parking demand for a residential development peaks during nighttime conditions, after 10:00 p.m.
Parking demand for the residential component of the project was reviewed based on US Census
data related to vehicle ownership as described below. The parking rate used to estimate the peak
parking demand for the retail is based on the ITE Parking Generation suburban rates for a
shopping center (#820). The vehicle mode split was assumed to be the same as used to estimate
weekday PM peak hour trip generation. The retail use typically peaks midday.

Residential
The weekday peak parking demand for the proposed residential units was estimated using local
vehicle ownership rates from US Census data.5 The peak parking demand for this type of residential
project is expected to be below national averages because the project is located near frequent transit
service and is well-connected with bicycle and pedestrian facilities described earlier. Based on local
vehicle ownership rates and the proposed mix of residential units, a peak parking demand rate of

0.72 vehicles per dwelling unit was estimated. This results in a weekday peak resident parking
demand of 96 vehicles. The detailed ownership rate calculations are provided in Attachment E. The
estimated peak residential parking demand of 96 parking spaces would not be accommodated by
the proposed supply of 73 parking spaces, with a potential spillover of approximately 23 vehicles.

Residential visitor parking demand peaks in the early evening hours. Residential visitor peak parking
demand rates are 0.05 vehicles per dwelling unit based on previously approved transportation
studies in the area.6 This results in a visitor weekday peak parking demand of approximately 7
vehicles.

Retail
The weekday retail parking demand was calculated based on Parking Generation (ITE, 4th Edition).
A rate of 2.55 stalls per 1,000 square feet, which is reduced by the mode split of vehicles
representing only 10 percent of anticipated retail travel, gives a rate of 0.26 stalls per 1,000 square
feet of retail. Using these rates, the anticipated peak parking demand is estimated to be 2 vehicles
for the retail land use and is anticipated to be accommodated on-street within the project vicinity.

Table 3 provides a summary of the estimated peak parking demand for the site by use.

Shared Parking
Given the mix of uses it is unlikely that they would peak at the same time. Apartment and
residential uses typically peak in the overnight hours while retail typically peak midday. Figure 3
shows the anticipated parking demand by time of day based on the proposed land uses.

                                       Figure 3 Hourly Shared Parking

As shown in Figure 3 the peak shared parking demand is anticipated to be 100 vehicles and could
not be accommodated in the total proposed supply of 73 stalls but would reduce the anticipated
spillover to 27 vehicles. Retail parking could be used during the late evening hours to
accommodate some of the residential peak.

On- Street Parking
Given that an overnight parking spillover could occur, a review of the 2015 SDOT parking study
was completed to see if the anticipated spillover of 27 vehicles could be accommodated on-street.
The review was completed for an approximately 800-foot walking radius from the project site.
Consideration was given to nearby pipeline developments described previously as well as the
project listed below:

                 2031 3rd Avenue                                     2300 6th Avenue
                 600 Wall Street                                     307 Broad Street

These developments are not anticipated to generate off-site parking demand within 800 feet of the
project site with the exception of 600 Wall Street. The 600 Wall Street project is anticipated to
have a total overspill of approximately 4 vehicles during the overnight hours with 1 vehicle within
800-foot parking radius overlap with the project site. Approximately 34 on-street parking spaces
are available after 7 PM, which could accommodate the anticipated parking overspill. Utilization
within 800 feet of the project site is currently at approximately 88 percent utilization and is
anticipated to remain at 88 percent under future without-project conditions. With the anticipated
spillover utilization could be approximately 98 percent in the study area.

                                                                                                  8
The anticipated parking overspill, could result in some additional circulation through the study area
as drivers search for parking; however, given the low vehicle ownership the proportional traffic
volume impact would be small. The difficulty finding parking could encourage reduced auto
ownership rates over time, consistent with City of Seattle urban transportation goals. As described
previously, the neighborhood has amenities nearby that are accessible via walking, biking, or
transit; reducing the need to rely on personal vehicles as the primary mode of travel.

Additionally, the parking review was completed for the 7 PM hour when retail and restaurant uses
are still utilizing on-street parking. It is anticipated that in the later evening hours the on-street
parking would not be as utilized for the retail/restaurant uses and more parking could be available
for residential uses.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with one of
the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The system, described
in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning Code, is designed to provide
a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation facilities would be available
“concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Directional traffic is anticipated to be reduced with completion of the proposed project. Therefore,
transportation concurrency is not affected by the proposed project; thus, the project would meet the
City’s concurrency requirements.


Summary and Findings
The proposed project would replace an existing 7,760 sf drive-in bank with a residential project,
with up to 134 apartment units and 5,000 sf of retail space. A parking garage with 73 vehicle stalls
and 63 bicycle parking spaces is proposed. Access would be via the alley off Wall Street and
Battery Street.

It is estimated that the trip generation would result in a net decrease when compared to the current
use. An analysis of the site driveway was conducted evaluating the weekday PM peak hour
conditions. It is anticipated that the Wall Street/Alley Access would operate at LOS C and the Batter
Street/Alley Access would operate at LOS B. As such, no operational or safety issues are anticipated
with the proposed access.

The proposed project would remove the existing parking stalls associated with the on-site use. As
noted, a total weekday peak parking demand of 96 vehicles has been estimated for the residential
uses (after 10:00 p.m.); and 7 vehicles associated with residential visitors peak parking demand
(between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m.), and 2 retail stalls (midday). The on-site supply of 73 spaces is would
result in spillover parking. If shared parking were utilized it is anticipated that the parking overspill
would be approximately 27 vehicles and could be accommodated on-street.

The proposed project would meet transportation concurrency requirements.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.
