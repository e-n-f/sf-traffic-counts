970 Denny Way Residential                                                                May 2015



                                       Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a residential apartment building located at 970 Denny
Way in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle. As necessary, mitigation measures
are identified that would offset or reduce significant transportation related impacts that the
project may have on the surrounding transportation system. This report also contains an
independent transportation impact fee calculation, consistent with methodologies for
developments in the South Lake Union area as outlined in the Department of Planning and
Development (DPD) Client Assistance Memo 243.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the north side of Denny Way, between Westlake Avenue
N and Terry Avenue N, in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood as shown on Figure 1.
The proposed project would develop up to 468 residential apartment units and 15,250 square
feet of retail.

The proposed project would provide a total of approximately 366 parking spaces within two
underground parking garages. Access to the parking garages would be provided via the
existing alley between Westlake Avenue N and Terry Avenue N. Figure 2 illustrates the
preliminary site plan. It is anticipated that the development would be constructed and
occupied by 2018.

The existing buildings and associated parking on the site would be removed as part of the
projects. The existing use consists of approximately 28,500 square-feet of general office and
26,500 square-feet of furniture store with 31 associated parking stalls.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with City of Seattle Department of Planning and
Development (DPD) staff and is consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the
South Lake Union area. Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed projects,
the following intersections were selected for analysis:
     1. Westlake Avenue N/John Street
     2. Terry Avenue N/John Street
     3. Westlake Avenue N/Denny Way
     4. Terry Avenue N/Denny Way

Additionally, the alley access locations on Denny Way and John Street were analyzed under
future (2018) with-project conditions. The study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour when
transportation impacts are anticipated to be highest. The report first describes existing and
future (2018) without-project conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the
street system, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2018)
with-project conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding
transportation system were identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the
future without-project conditions.

        Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing (2015) and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system, planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service.

Street System
The following describes the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed project
and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.
Existing
Characteristics of the existing street system in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is in the immediate vicinity of two four-
lane principal arterials (Denny Way and Westlake Avenue N).

1.   Parking is allowed on the west side of the street.

Future
This section identifies specific transportation improvements that will affect the future South
Lake Union transportation system.

Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2014 – 2019 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) and WSDOT improvements, two street system transportation projects were identified
and are anticipated to be completed by 2018. These transportation projects may affect
vehicle travel patterns in South Lake Union. Details related to these two roadway projects in
the study area are described below.
Mercer Corridor Project – Mercer West construction began in April 2013 and is anticipated
to be completed by 2015. The project will extend the Mercer East improvements by
constructing three continuous westbound through lanes from Dexter Avenue N to Elliot
Avenue W to make Mercer Street a two-way street from I-5 to Elliot Avenue W. Roy Street
will also be converted into a two-way street. This project will provide east-west connectivity
through the South Lake Union, Westlake, and Lower Queen Anne neighborhoods. It will also
provide vehicular access to the north portal of the SR 99 Tunnel. Peak hour traffic patterns in
the South Lake Union neighborhood between I-5 and Downtown will change significantly with
completion of the Mercer Corridor Project.
Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program is currently under construction and due to
delays WSDOT is reevaluating the schedule. This evaluation assumes the Viaduct would be
completed by 2018, the analysis horizon year. The project will provide a two-mile long tunnel
and connect S Royal Brougham Way in South Downtown to Mercer Street near the proposed
development project. The tunnel will replace the existing Alaskan Way Viaduct and Broad
Street tunnel and will connect to the existing SR 99 roadway on the north and south ends.
South of the site, the North Portal of SR 99 will be constructed, providing access to and from
SR 99 via Republican Street and Mercer Street/6th Avenue N.

Traffic Volumes
The following summarize the traffic volumes for existing and future without-project conditions.
Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in April 2015. Figure 3 illustrates the
existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, rounded to the
nearest 5 vehicles. Detail traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.
Future
Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 1 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at
each study intersection. This growth rate was is consistent with previously approved traffic
studies. Traffic from the following pipeline projects in the project vicinity were also included in
the future without-project volume forecasts:

      •   234 9th Avenue N: Mixed-use development including approximately 1 apartment
          unit, up to 149,380 square feet office space and up to 15,560 square feet of ground
          floor retail.
      •   2101 9th Avenue: Mixed-use development including approximately 430 residential
          units and approximately 8,300 of retail space.
      •   2200 7th Avenue: Development of up to 835,200 square feet of office space and
          30,000 square-feet of retail/restaurant space.
      •
                                 1
          110 9th Avenue N : Development of 470 residential units and up to 7,000 square
          feet of retail space.
      •   111 Westlake Ave N: Development of approximately 400,000 square feet of office
          space and up to 28,000 square feet retail space.
      •   2202 8th Avenue: Office building including approximately 400,000 square feet of
          office space and up to 28,000 square feet of retail.
      •   1120 Denny Way: Development of 1,067 residential units and approximately 28,000
          square feet of retail space.
      •   756 John Street: 74 low income residential units and approximately 8,000 square
          feet of retail space.

Future (2018) without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.


Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour
of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection. Traffic
operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service
(LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme

congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of
the intersections. Under future 2018 conditions, signal timing maximum splits were optimized.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2018) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized in Table
2. Trip generation is documented in the subsequent Project Impact section of this study.
Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix C.

3.   Worst movement reported for unsignalized intersections.
4.   Intersection operates with no traffic control, for analysis purposes the intersection was treated as an all-way stop.
5.   The eastbound and westbound movements are the worst movements and experience large delays, which were not calculable
     using the HCM method due to the volume of pedestrians. The delay calculations take into consideration the number of
     pedestrians as a conflicting movement for vehicle movements.


As shown in Table 2, the Terry Avenue N/John Street and Westlake Avenue/Denny Way
study intersections currently operate at LOS C or better during the weekday PM peak hour.
Field observations indicate the Denny Way and Westlake Avenue N corridors are congested
and traffic counts likely do not reflect actual demands at the Denny Way/Westlake Avenue N
intersection. Operations experienced by drivers may be worse than reported; however, the
analysis does provide an understanding of the relative impacts of growth in the area.

The unsignalized intersection of Terry Avenue N/Denny Way and Westlake Avenue N/John
Street operate at LOS F. LOS F operations at the Westlake Avenue N/ John Street
intersection are due to the concentration of pedestrians conflicting with vehicular traffic. The
Terry Avenue N/Denny Way LOS F intersection operations are related to the high volume
along Denny Way resulting in minimal gaps in traffic for Terry Avenue N traffic to entering the
traffic stream. Traffic volumes along Terry Avenue N are relatively low with approximately 45
vehicles per hour northbound and 20 vehicles per hour southbound during the weekday PM
peak hour, perhaps reflecting some current level of diversion away from this location.

In 2018, with the anticipated growth in traffic, the intersections are anticipated to experience
increases in delay over current levels but would continue to operate at the same LOS as
under existing conditions. Level of service F conditions are not unusual when a stop-
controlled approach intersects with a busy main street. In urban area, this is compounded by
pedestrian traffic.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three year summary of accident data from
the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2012
and December 31, 2014. In addition to the study intersections, collision data along
Republican Street, Minor Avenue N, and Harrison Street in the study area were analyzed to
evaluate the vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle safety. This information is summarized in Table
3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high accident location status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. As shown in Table 3, within the
analysis period, all unsignalized locations had less than 5 collisions per year and all
signalized locations had less than 10 collisions per year. No safety issues are identified at the
study intersections.

In addition, SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates
of list of “high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The
review screens the previous year (in this case 2013) collision for signalized intersections with
10 or more collisions in a year, unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, and
locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions. Within the study area, SDOT has not
identified any HCLs, which is consistent with the collision history review presented.

A review of the roadway segments indicates less than 2 collisions per year along the adjacent
corridors with the exception of Denny Way between Westlake and Terry Avenue, which
experienced an average of approximately 6 collisions per year. Approximately 63 percent of
these collisions included rear-end type collisions and approximately 73 percent resulted in
property damage only. Rear-end collisions are common along facilities where there are
frequent stop-and-go conditions such as found along Denny Way. Further review of the
collision data indicates no reported fatalities in the study area, 1 bicycle-related collision, and
no pedestrian-related collision. The bicycle-related collision occurred during the day with wet
road conditions.

Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.
Existing
Sidewalks are provided on all streets in the study area except Terry Avenue. A marked
crosswalk exists at the Westlake Ave N/Denny Way intersection. No crosswalks are provided
at other crossings in the study area.
Future
In the immediate vicinity of the site, according to the Adopted Seattle Bicycle Master Plan,
April 2014, a protected cycle track is recommended along 9th Avenue N as part of the City
wide network.

Outside the immediate vicinity of the project site in the greater South Lake Union area, the
Mercer Corridor projects would provide pedestrian and bicycle paths on both sides of Mercer
and Valley Streets. The Cheshiahud Lake Union Trail Project will construct a cycle track
along Westlake Avenue N.


Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.
Existing
Bus transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit and the City of
Seattle Streetcar. The nearest bus stops are located along Denny Way near Westlake
Avenue and along Westlake Avenue south of Denny Way, approximately 250-feet south (or a
1- to 2-minute walk) from the project site. Additional bus stops are also located approximately
700-800 feet to the northwest and east at John St/9th and Fairview Ave N/Denny Way,
respectively. The existing project area is served by 7 transit routes that provide service
throughout the Seattle metro area. The service areas, operating hours, and weekday PM
peak hour trips and headways are summarized in Table 4.

1. Express service


As shown in the table, service during the weekday PM peak hour is relatively frequent with
the streetcar and several bus routes operating with headways of 15-minutes or less. In
addition, the site is well connected to downtown by both bus service and streetcar.
Future
There are no transit service changes in the site vicinity based on available plans.

                                       Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street system and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic generated by the proposed
project are distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within the study
area for the weekday PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-project
traffic volumes and the potential impacts to traffic operations, safety, transit, and non-
motorized facilities are identified.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site. The net new trips generated takes into
account the current trips on the network, which are being generated by the existing uses on-
site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then estimating
the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level
of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




                                                                                                  11

Total person trips were developed for the existing and proposed uses based on trip rates
from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Average vehicle occupancy (AVO) was
estimated from the Trip Generation Manual for the existing general office (#710), furniture
store (#890), and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report
365 Travel Estimating Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed residential
apartments.

Residential person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the
total person trips by the estimated mode splits from the US Census 2009-2013 American
Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting Characteristics. 2 The survey shows a 35
percent auto mode split for census tract 73 where the project is located. After applying the
auto mode split, residential person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by
                            3
assuming an AVO of 1.16.

The Commute Seattle’s 2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split report summarizes Commute
Trip Reduction (CTR) data by Seattle neighborhood. The data shows, for the South Lake
Union neighborhood, 58 percent of employee trips were made by auto (45 percent single
occupancy vehicles and 13 percent carpool/vanpool), 27 percent by transit, and 15 percent
walking, biking, or other modes. After applying the auto mode split, office person trips were
                                                                                      4
then converted back to vehicle trips by using average vehicle occupancies of 1.12.

Portions of the residential apartments in South Lake Union are being leased to nearby
employers to accommodate short and long-term employee travel, which typically results in
employee trips by walking or other non-SOV means. In the case that some or all of the
proposed residential units are leased to nearby employers to accommodate their employee
recruiting and housing needs, the proposed project trip generation estimates could be
significantly higher than what actually occurs. Appendix D provides the detailed trip
generation calculation. Table 5 summarizes the estimated weekday daily and AM and PM
peak hour trip generation for the proposed and existing land uses.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based on guidance
from the Director’s Rule 5-2009, OnTheMap, as well as a review of existing travel patterns,
planned improvements, and previous studies conducted in the area.

OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more
likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive.

Figure 5 illustrates the expected project vehicle trip distribution for the proposed project, to
the surrounding local and regional street system. The weekday PM peak hour trips were
assigned to the study area based on the travel patterns shown on Figure 5 and the location of
the site access. The project would provide access via the alley way between Westlake
Avenue N and Terry Avenue N. The distribution and assignment considers the primary travel
routes within the gridded street system where project impacts would be greatest. It is
recognized that drivers may take alternative routes; however, it is anticipated that impacts
along these facilities would be less than disclosed in this analysis.

The project traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes
to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2018 with-project traffic volumes
are shown on Figure 6.

As shown in the table, the percent traffic volume impacts are relatively low even in the site
vicinity and range from approximately 1 to 3 percent at the study intersections. Overall the
project volume impacts identified at the study intersections are within the range of daily
fluctuations in traffic, which can be up to 5 percent. The project would have the greatest
impact at the alley access on John Street representing approximately 18 percent of the PM
peak hour traffic volumes. Project related impacts at the site access location on Denny is
anticipated to be approximately 2 percent but could be less than assigned depending on
Denny Way traffic and vehicle platooning on Denny Way. Weekday PM peak hour project
impacts at the Denny Way alley access are anticipated to be less due to congestion along the
street and the difficulty turning left into the alley, which is anticipated to result in drivers
mainly accessing the site via John Street.

Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as described for
existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters such as
channelization and traffic control were consistent with those used in the evaluation of future
without-project conditions. A comparison of future without and with-project weekday PM peak
hour traffic operations is summarized for the project site in Table 7. Detailed LOS worksheets
are provided in Appendix C.

2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3.   Worst movement reported for unsignalized intersections.
4.   Intersection operates with no traffic control, for analysis purposes the intersection was treated as an all-way stop.
5.   The eastbound and westbound movements are the worst movements and experience large delays, which were not calculable
     using the HCM method due to the volume of pedestrians. The delay calculations take into consideration the number of
     pedestrians as a conflicting movement for vehicle movements.


As indicated in Table 7, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with little to no change in calculated delays or LOS. Typically, the City does not consider an
impact significant if it is a less than 5 second increase in delay.

As discussed previously, poor operations at the Westlake Avenue N/John Street intersection
are due to the concentration of pedestrians at this location and the conflicts between vehicles
and pedestrians. The proposed project would likely increase pedestrians at this intersection
and would increase traffic volumes at this intersection by less than 2 percent. Given the
gridded street network, it is likely that drivers would find alternative routes if they experience
long delays at this location.

The project is anticipated add 51 weekday PM peak hour trips along Denny Way at Terry
Avenue N, which represents approximately 2 percent of the overall 2018 future traffic
volumes at this location. As discussed under existing conditions, traffic volumes are relatively
low along Terry Avenue N and the proposed project is not anticipated to increase these
volumes. Given the difficulty of entering the Denny Way traffic stream from Terry Avenue N
during the weekday PM peak hour, drivers may find an alternative route, especially traffic
exiting the alley to the east on Denny Way (via left-turn).


Site Access Evaluation
The proposed project includes two underground parking garages, one primarily designated
for retail and one designated for residential use. Access to each garage would be provided
via the alley between Westlake Avenue N and Terry Avenue N. The site access on John
Street is anticipated to operate at LOS B and the site access on Denny Way is anticipated to
operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour. As discussed previously, congestion along
Denny Way makes it difficult for vehicles to enter the traffic stream and as a result most of the
project traffic is anticipated to exit or enter the site via the alley access at John Street.

Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include Ship Canal to Aurora Avenue
N (Screenline 5.13) South of Lake Union (Screenline 8) and South of S Jackson Street
(Screenline 10.11), as shown in Table 8 for Building A and Building B. As a conservative
estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the
screenlines would extend across the screenlines included in this analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
demand of the project, and parking code requirements.
Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by two underground parking garages with
a total of 366 stalls. Access to each parking garage would be provided via driveways located
mid-block in the alley between Westlake Avenue N and Terry Avenue N. There will be a
separate access for the 37 retail parking stalls and another access for the remaining 329
residential parking stalls.

The parking supply rates are consistent with recently approved projects in the South Lake
Union neighborhood and City policies, which are aimed at encouraging a multimodal
transportation network and limiting drive alone trips. As opportunities for transit, car share,
etc. increase and with employment in the immediate vicinity of the site, it is anticipated
vehicle ownership and the need for parking will decrease.
Demand
The peak parking demand is expected to be below national averages due the project’s
proximity to transit service and its relative location to South Lake Union, a high-density urban
village with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The peak parking



                                                                                                                       17

demand for the proposed project was estimated based on data provided in ITE Parking
Generation (4th Edition), Urban Land Institute’s Shared Parking (2nd Edition), local mode of
                                                                                            5
travel data consistent with the trip generation analysis, and local vehicle ownership data.
This approach is consistent with approved traffic studies conducted in the vicinity of the site.
Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix E. The peak parking demand occurs
overnight.

Parking demand for the residential component of the project was reviewed in two ways: (1)
based on US Census data related to vehicle ownership and (2) based on ITE Parking
Generation (4th Edition) and consideration of peak period parking demand per bedroom.

US Census Data Method. The site is located in census tract 73; the majority of this area is
located west of I-5. An analysis was completed to estimate the approximate on-site peak
parking demand of the proposed development accounting for each land use’s different time of
peak parking demand over the course of a typical day. Detailed calculations are provided in
Appendix E.

The peak parking demand for the apartment uses are expected to be below national
averages due the project’s proximity to transit service and its location in a high-density urban
center with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The parking rate used
to estimate the peak parking demand for the apartments (0.75 vehicles per unit) is based on
                            6
average vehicle ownership from US Census data. Based on the proposed mix of apartment
      7
units, the associated parking rates are shown in Table 9. A visitor parking demand rate of
0.15 vehicles per unit was assumed based on data provided in Shared Parking. The total
parking demand rate based on US Census Data is higher than recently approved parking
supply rates in the project vicinity. The South Lake Union neighborhood is rapidly changing
and use of Census data from 2013 may overestimate vehicle ownership. It is anticipated
vehicle ownership and the need for parking will decrease with improvements in transit, car
share opportunities, employment nearby, etc.

Note: du = dwelling units, ksf = 1,000 square feet


As shown in Table 9, the estimated peak parking demand associated with residential parking
is approximately 421 vehicles, and the peak parking demand associated with retail is
approximately 20 vehicles. Residential and retail parking areas are separate and are
accessed by separate driveways. The residential vehicle demand could exceed supply by 92
parking stalls, and retail parking has a surplus of 17 parking stalls. Both land uses have
different weekday peak hours – residential is around 10 p.m. and retail around 1 p.m.
Consideration could be given to allowing residents to use the retail parking area in the
evening to increase the parking supply available to the residential land use. Allowance of
shared parking between the residential and retail uses results in a peak parking demand of

421 vehicles for the site resulting in a potential spillover of 55 vehicles (see Appendix E).
Consideration of use of on-street parking to accommodate potential spillover is described
below.

ITE Parking Generation Method. Data presented in ITE Parking Generation (4th Edition) for
High-Rise Apartments (Land Use 222) in urban locations, is based on sites with an average
size of 2 bedrooms per unit and presents a parking rate of 1.37 vehicles per unit. Based on
the average number of bedrooms per unit, the ITE parking rate is 0.69 vehicles per bedroom.
The project is proposing studio, 1, 2, and 3-bedroom. Based on this the anticipated parking
demand is shown in Table 10.

As shown in Table 10, using the parking rate per bedroom, the resulting peak parking
demand would be 403 vehicles for the residential land use and 20 vehicles for the retail use.
The retail supply and demand is unchanged. This results in a combine demand of
approximately 423 vehicles.

The ITE method estimates a residential demand of 403, which is smaller compared to the US
Census method. However, there is still an anticipated spillover of 74 vehicles without shared
parking. As discussed previously, availability is anticipated within the retail parking garage.
Shared parking could be considered to accommodate potential demands. A review of shared
parking shows a combined peak parking demand of 403 vehicles resulting in a potential
spillover of 37 vehicles (see Appendix E).

In reviewing the parking demand for the proposed project, given the availability of alternative
modes of travel within the site vicinity including transit and bicycle facilities, it is likely that the
site would tend towards lower auto ownership characteristic of higher density residential. As
described previously, residential apartments in the area are being leased to nearby
employers to accommodate out-of-town employees, which could also result in lower auto
ownership in the case the proposed project would have similar characteristics. It is
recommended that shared parking be considered between the residential and retail parking
to help accommodate the anticipated parking demand on-site. Depending on the level of
shared parking and if realized actual demand is below the conservative calculations herein,
actual demand could be less, there could be a spillover ranging between 45 and 75 vehicles.

On-Street Parking
A review of the 2014 SDOT parking study was completed to see if the anticipated overspill of
45 to 75 vehicles could be accommodated on-street. The review was completed for an
approximately 800-foot walking radius from the project site. Consideration was given to
nearby pipeline developments, described previously, these developments are not anticipated
to generate off-site parking demand. Approximately 68 on-street parking spaces are
available, which could accommodate the lower end of the anticipated parking overspill.

Parking Code Analysis
This section outlines the parking code requirements for vehicular and bicycle parking.

Off-Street Vehicle Parking
The project includes 366 parking spaces for the residential and retail uses. Per Seattle
Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there is no minimum parking requirement the development
as the project is located within the South Lake Union urban center.

Bicycle Parking
Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

SMC Section 23.54.015, Table E outlines the bicycle parking siting and quantity
requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for short-term
(less than 4 hours) and long-term (more than 4 hours). For the apartment use, no short-term
bicycle parking is required and 1 space for every 4 apartment units is required long-term use.
This results in 117 long-term bicycle spaces. For the retail use, 1 space per 4,000 square feet
is required for short-term, and 1 space per 12,000 square feet is required for long-term. This
results in 4 short-term bicycle spaces, and 2 long-term bicycle spaces. In total, the project
would be required to provide 4 short-term and 119 long-term bicycle parking spaces. Since
the vehicular parking for this project is provided in a covered, below-grade garage all long-
term bicycle parking must also be covered.

                    Mitigation and Recommendations
The proposed project would construct frontage improvements along Denny Way, Terry
Avenue N, and John Street. These frontage improvements would fully integrate with the non-
motorized facilities along the corridor. In addition, the project impacts to the surrounding
transportation system would be mitigated through the South Lake Union transportation
mitigation payment (detailed in DPD Client Assistance Memo 243). Additional detail on
mitigation measures is provided below.


Transportation Mitigation Payment
To mitigate impacts of the proposal on the surrounding transportation system, the developer
would be required to pay the South Lake Union transportation mitigation payment. The City
has implemented a program in and around the South Lake Union neighborhood that requires
new developments to contribute towards planned improvements identified in the South Lake
Union Transportation Plan. Improvements in this transportation plan include a combination of
vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects located in the neighborhood which would
benefit all users.

The development mitigation payment schedule is set forth by DPD’s Client Assistance Memo
243 – Transportation Mitigation Payments. The developer is opting to pay based on a pro-
rata share calculation, which is based on the number of weekday PM peak hour trips using
the South Lake Union infrastructure. This mitigation fee is estimated to be $38,743 for the
project. This fee is a preliminary calculation and would be finalized by the City upon issuance
of the decision on the proposed project.

                             Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with of the mixed-use
development located at 970 Denny Way in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle.
General findings and recommendations include:

      •     The proposed project would construct 468 residential apartment units and 15,250
            square feet of retail.
      •     After accounting for the existing uses on the project site, the development is
            anticipated to generate 1,040 net new vehicular weekday daily trips with 54
            net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 81 net new trips
            during the PM peak hour.
      •     Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via the alley between
            Westlake Avenue N and Terry Avenue N.
      •     All of the off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better
            with the project with the exception of the Westlake Avenue N/John Street and Terry
            Avenue N/Denny Way intersections. The Westlake Avenue N/John Street and Terry
            Avenue N/Denny Way intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS F under
            without or with-project conditions. Given the gridded network, it is likely that drivers
            would find alternative routes if they experience long delays at these locations.
      •     The Denny Way alley access would also operate at LOS F. Given the difficulty
            accessing the site access on Denny Way, the analysis is conservative and drivers
            would likely use John Street especially when heading to the west.
      •     The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
      •     The parking supply for the proposed project is 366 vehicle parking stalls (329 for
            residential and 37 for retail). Given the availability of alternative modes of travel
            within the site vicinity including transit and bicycle facilities as well as the large
            amount of employment opportunities, it is likely that the site would tend towards
            lower auto ownership characteristic of higher density residential. It is recommended
            that shared parking be considered between the residential and retail parking to help
            accommodate the anticipated parking demand on-site. Depending on the level of
            shared parking and if realized actual demand is below the conservative calculations
            herein, actual demand could be less, there could be a spillover ranging between 45
            and 75 vehicles.
      •     The surrounding on-street parking could accommodate the potential off-site parking
            needs for the lower end of the parking demand.
      •     The developer would be required to pay a transportation mitigation fee. The
            mitigation fee is estimated to be $38,743 based on the project’s calculated pro-rata
            share.
      •     The project would be required to provide 4 short-term and 119 long-term bicycle
            parking spaces.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.

    1. Person trip mode splits based on 2009 - 2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates for census tract (#73) of the proposed project, consideration of the future land use in
    South Lake Union, and previous studies completed in South Lake Union.
    2. Mode split considers that the larger retail space is anticipated to serve a larger market area than just the immediate vicinity.
    3. Mode splits for office use were based on a review of 2014 CTR data, which is based on office with 100 or more employees and adjusted considering the potential for higher vehicle
    use with the smaller existing office buildings.
