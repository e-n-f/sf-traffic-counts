SUBJECT:         WAYNE’S PLACE APARTMENTS TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS


Dear Harry:

This letter report and supporting attachments summarize the traffic impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed
Wayne’s Place Apartments. It provides a description of the proposed project, study scope and area, roadway
network, existing and future traffic volumes, traffic safety, vehicle trip generation and distribution, traffic
operations, site access and sight distance analysis, traffic safety impacts, and school walkways. It was
determined that the proposed development would not generate any significant traffic-related impacts and
therefore, no off-site mitigation measures would be necessary.

Project Description. The project site is currently undeveloped and located immediately north of SE 180th
Street and west of 140th Avenue SE in unincorporated King County. The proposed project would include the
construction of up to 79 mid-rise apartment units. Vehicular access is proposed via one driveway on SE 180th
Street, approximately 140 feet west of 140th Avenue SE. Figure 1 illustrates the site vicinity and a preliminary
site plan is shown in Figure 2.

Study Scope and Area. The TIA scope follows requirements set forth in the King County Integrated
Transportation Program (ITP) and has been coordinated with development review staff from KCDOT. Based
on ITP requirements, one off-site intersection (140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street) would be impacted by
30 or more peak hour project trips and at least 20 percent of total peak hour project traffic and is studied
accordingly.

Traffic operations are evaluated during average weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions. This
reflects the highest hourly traffic volumes throughout an average day and typically occurs between 7:00 and
9:00 a.m. and between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m., respectively.

Roadway Network. The following section summarizes the roadways and intersections within the study area
as well as existing non-motorized and transit facilities. The two roadways within the study area include:

       140th Avenue SE is a five-lane principal arterial with a posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour (mph).
        Two northbound through lanes, two southbound through lanes, and a two-way center left-turn lane
        exist on 140th Avenue SE east of the project site. On-street bicycle lanes and sidewalks exist on both
        sides of the roadway.

       SE 180th Street is a two-lane neighborhood collector roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph,
        providing one eastbound through lane and one westbound through lane. There are no bicycle
        facilities or sidewalks provided on this roadway.

       140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street Intersection includes a single eastbound approach lane, two
        northbound through lanes, two southbound through lanes and a two-way left-turn lane that is currently
        used by northbound-to-westbound left-turning traffic and eastbound-to-northbound left-turning traffic.

Transit facilities are provided north of the site on 140th Avenue SE and SE Petrovitsky Road. The nearest
transit stop is approximately 1,700 feet walking distance from the site on SE Petrovitsky Road west of 140th
Avenue SE. In total, there are three transit routes available (operated by King County Metro) within the study
area and are summarized below:

       Route 102 operates between Fairwood and Downtown Seattle on weekdays from approximately
        4:45 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. in the mornings to Downtown Seattle and from approximately 3:30 p.m. to
        6:00 p.m. in the afternoons to Fairwood.

       Route 148 operates between Fairwood and the Renton Transit Center seven days a week. On
        weekdays, the route runs from approximately 5:45 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. every 30 minutes. On
        weekends, the route runs from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every hour.

       DART Route 906 operates between Fairwood and Southcenter from Monday to Saturday. On
        weekdays, the route runs from approximately 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every hour. On Saturdays, the
        route runs from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every hour.

Traffic Volumes. Existing weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the intersection of 140th
Avenue SE and SE 180th Street were collected on a typical weekday in May 2017 and are provided in
Attachment 1.

Future without-project weekday traffic volumes at 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street were estimated by
increasing existing volumes annually by 6 percent and 1 percent during the AM and PM peak hour,
respectively. In addition, project trips from three nearby pipeline projects (28-lot Fairwood Assemblage
development, 88-lot Addison Park development, and 117-bed Fairwood Memory Care Assisted Living
development) were also assigned to the study intersection. This is a reasonable approach in forecasting
future volumes in that AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the nearby intersection of SE Petrovitsky Road
/ 140th Avenue SE increased by about 6 percent per year and 0.2 percent per year, respectively, between
2015 and 2017.

Traffic Safety Analysis. Collision data from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 at the 140th Avenue SE
/ SE 180th Street intersection and SE 180th Street west of 140th Avenue SE was obtained from the
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). These records represent the most recent
complete 3-year period for which complete collision data are available. No collisions were reported during the
three-year period, which suggests that there are no traffic safety issues within the study area.

Existing Traffic Operations. Existing AM and PM peak hour traffic operations were evaluated at the
intersection of 140th Avenue SE and SE 180th Street. Traffic operations were evaluated based on the
procedures identified in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. Table 1 summarizes future AM and PM peak
hour levels of service (LOS); detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Attachment 2.

As shown in Table 1, the study intersection currently meets the King County operational standard of LOS E or
better during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.

Trip Generation. Table 2 illustrates the anticipated number of new daily, AM peak hour, and PM peak hour
vehicle trips the proposed development would likely generate. These estimates were derived by multiplying
the proposed number of units (79) by the average daily and peak hour trip generation rates for Land Use
Code No. 223 (“Mid-Rise Apartment”) published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Trip
Generation Manual (9th Edition, 2012).

2.    No daily trip rate available for LU 223, daily rate for LU 220 (Apartment) was used instead.


As illustrated above, the proposed development is anticipated to generate approximately 526 daily vehicle
trips, including 24 and 31 vehicle trips during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

Trip Distribution & Assignment. It was assumed that approximately one-half of project trips would be
oriented to/from the north and one-half to/from the south during the AM and PM peak hours based on analysis
of travel patterns at the study intersection. Weekday AM and PM peak hour project trip assignment at the
study intersection is illustrated in Figure 3. Project-generated peak hour traffic volumes were added to future
without-project traffic volumes at the site access and study intersections; the resulting future with-project peak
hour traffic volumes (along with existing and future without-project volumes) are all illustrated in Figure 4.

Traffic Volume Impact. After project trips were added to future without-project traffic volumes, the project
share at the study intersection is expected to represent approximately 1 percent of the total entering volumes
during the future AM and PM peak hours.

Future Traffic Operations. Future without-project and with-project AM and PM peak hour traffic operations
were evaluated at the intersection of 140th Avenue SE and SE 180th Street; no changes to the existing
channelization were made at the 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street intersection. Traffic operations were
evaluated based on the procedures identified in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. Table 4 summarizes
future AM and PM peak hour LOS.

2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.

As shown in the table above, the study intersection would operate at the same LOS with or without project
traffic. With the addition of project trips, the eastbound approach at the study intersection would experience
approximately two seconds of additional delay during both peak hours. Thus, the intersection would continue
to meet the King County LOS standard of LOS E or better.

Site Access Analysis. Future with-project AM and PM peak hour traffic operations were evaluated at the
site access driveway on SE 180th Street. Traffic operations were evaluated based on the procedures
identified in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. Table 4 summarizes future AM and PM peak hour LOS.

3.   Worst movement where SB = southbound approach


As seen in Table 4, the site access driveway would operate at LOS A during both future peak hours, meeting
the King County LOS standard of LOS E or better.
Left- and right-turn lane warrants were analyzed at the site access driveway. Based on the WSDOT Design
Manual1, it was determined that no dedicated left-turn or right-turn lanes are required or recommended based
on the projected future turning movement volumes.

Sight Distance. Stopping and entering sight distance was evaluated at the proposed site access intersection
as well as the 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street intersection. Stopping sight distance is the distance
necessary to enable a motorist to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. In contrast, entering
sight distance is the distance necessary for a motorist to enter the traffic stream without causing traffic on the
major street to reduce its travel speed. The methods and standards used to measure available sight distance
are defined in the King County Road Design and Construction Standards (2016) and are summarized below:

       For the 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street intersection with an estimated 50-mph design speed
        along 140th Avenue SE (equal to 10 mph above the posted speed limit as defined on page 1-13 of
        these Standards), the recommended minimum stopping sight distance is 425 feet and the
        recommended minimum entering sight distance is 555 feet.

       For the site access driveway on SE 180th Street with an estimated 35-mph design speed, the
        recommended minimum stopping sight distance is 250 feet and the recommended minimum entering
        sight distance is 390 feet.

Field measurements demonstrate that existing stopping sight distance is more than 425 feet north and south
of the 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street intersection. Similarly, field measurements demonstrate that
existing entering sight distance is more than 555 feet looking south. Existing shrubbery and overgrown weeds
at the eastern edge of the lot currently obstructs entering sight distance looking north. However, it is expected
that the entering sight distance requirement looking north will be met following development of the property.

At the site access intersection, field measurements demonstrate that both the entering sight distance (390
feet) and stopping sight distance (250 feet) requirements would be met west of the driveway. East of the
proposed driveway, entering and stopping sight distance is available to/from the adjacent 140th Avenue SE /
SE 180th Street intersection, approximately 140 feet east of the driveway. Therefore, King County’s minimum
sight distance standards would be met at both the 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street intersection and site
access intersection.

Traffic Safety Impact. Traffic generated by the proposed project would likely result in a proportionate
increase in the probability of vehicular collisions. It is unlikely, however, that this traffic would create a safety
hazard or significantly increase the number of reported collisions at 140th Avenue SE / SE 180th Street or
along SE 180th Street west of 140th Avenue SE because no collisions were reported during the last three
complete years.

School Walkways. Public school for children living in the proposed multi-family development would be
provided by the Kent School District (KSD). Depending on age, future students would be assigned to Carriage
Crest Elementary School (CCES), Northwood Middle School, or Kentridge High School and busing would not
be provided for students attending CCES but would be provided for students attending Northwood Middle
School and Kentridge High School. The nearest bus stop for middle school and high school students is
located at CCES.

Safe walking conditions will exist between the project site and CCES as frontage improvements will include
new sidewalk on the north side of SE 180th Street west of 140th Avenue SE. Students will cross SE 180th
Street on the west side of 140th Avenue SE. Sidewalk exists on the west side of 140th Avenue SE between
SE 180th Street and the access driveway to CCES.
