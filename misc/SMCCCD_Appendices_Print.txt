                                  AMENDMENT

A.        INTRODUCTION
The purpose of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to inform decision makers and the general public
of the environmental effects of a proposed project. The EIR process is intended to provide environmental
information sufficient to evaluate a proposed project and its potential for significant impacts on the
environment; to examine methods of reducing adverse environmental impacts; and to consider alternatives
to the project. Although an EIR is one of the first documents to be reviewed when considering a project, the
document itself, including its certification, does not constitute project approval. Upon finding the EIR is
complete and in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970, as amended, the
District Board of Trustees will consider certification of the EIR at a public hearing.

The EIR for the Project will be prepared and processed in accordance with CEQA and will include:
         A summary of the Project
         A Project description
         An environmental setting, impact analysis and mitigation measures
         Alternatives to the Project as proposed
         Other CEQA considerations including: (a) any significant environmental effects which cannot be
          avoided if the Project is implemented, (b) the growth-inducing impacts of the proposed Project, and
          (c) cumulative impacts.

B.        PROJECT LOCATION
The San Mateo County Community College District (District) has three campuses in San Mateo County,
California, including Cañada College in Redwood City and the Town of Woodside, College of San Mateo
(CSM) in the City of San Mateo, and Skyline College in the City of San Bruno. Figure 1 shows the regional
locations of each of the three campuses.
Cañada College
Cañada College is 124 acres located within Redwood City and the Town of Woodside. Regional access is

the west and south, and a County jail to the south.

C.       DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The 2015 Facilities Master Plan Amendment would continue the modernization and renovation work that
began with adoption of the District’s 2001 and 2006 Facilities Master Plans. The 2015 Facilities Master Plan
Amendment identifies planned improvements at the three campuses including, but not limited to: building
modernization and renovation, building demolition, new building construction, tree removal,
landscaping/pedestrian improvements, and changes in parking and roadways. The locations of each of the
proposed improvements are shown in Figures 2 through 4. The specific design and construction of campus
projects would occur as projects are funded through the District’s Capital Improvement Program.

The Project proposes the following development at each campus:

            o Building 1/1A
            o   Energy Management Programs Facility

The proposed improvements would not facilitate increases in enrollment, employment, or contribute to
campus growth. Enrollment at the three campuses has stabilized and is not currently limited as a function
of campus size. The overarching purpose of the proposed improvements, including increasing building
square footage, is to better serve approximately the same numbers of current students and staff with
modern facilities and technology for the foreseeable future. Therefore, increasing the building square
footage to improve functionality is not expected to result in significantly increased enrollment or campus
employment.


                                                                                                         Page 4
However, there are two components of the Project that would increase use of specific campus facilities.
Building 1, Kinesiology/Wellness Building, at the Cañada campus would be open to public memberships, in
addition to use by students, staff and faculty. The residential complex at Skyline College would house the
general public in single-family homes and staff and faculty in the multi-family housing.

D.      ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT
The Project could result in potential environmental effects associated with the following resource topics or
environmental issues: aesthetics, air quality and energy, biological resources, cultural resources, geology
and soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land
use and planning, noise, population and housing, public services and utilities, and transportation/traffic,
cumulative impacts, alternatives to the project, and growth inducing impacts. The analysis and potential
effects are described further below. The Project would not result in environmental effects associated with
agriculture and forest resources or mineral resources because these are not present on the Project site or
area.
Aesthetics
The EIR will describe the existing visual character of the Project site and surrounding area including the
existing viewpoints, notable visual resources, and the visual quality of the Project area and any impacts to
scenic views that would result from development of the Project. This resource section will also consider the
potential impacts of the creation of new sources of light and glare. Visual simulations from critical public
viewpoints will be prepared to demonstrate changes in views as a result of the Project. The impact analysis
will focus on changes in key public views, including alteration of visual character, impacts to scenic
highways, and any proposed nighttime light and daytime glare, and will include recommendations and
mitigation measures to lessen potential Project impacts, as appropriate.
Air Quality and Energy
Air Quality

The EIR will describe existing air quality conditions, potential impacts from Project construction and
operation, and mitigation measures, including those recommended and required by the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District (BAAQMD) designed to reduce the significance of identified Project-related air
quality impacts. A screening-level health risk assessment will be prepared to estimate potential health risks
associated with the Project. It is anticipated that construction activities could result in emissions of toxic air
contaminants from diesel fuel combustion in construction equipment and heavy-duty trucks. Mitigation
and/or avoidance measures will be identified for significant air quality impacts, as appropriate.
Energy Conservation

If feasible, the EIR will provide a quantitative analysis of transportation energy impacts, construction and
operational energy impacts, and renewable energy impacts. The EIR will include a qualitative energy
analysis for the Project based on Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. The energy analysis will include a
discussion of relevant regulations and will describe existing energy resources and consumption levels
within California and San Mateo County and by the District. Consistent with CEQA Guidelines Appendix F,
the proposed Project will be evaluated for its potential to lead to a wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary
usage of direct or indirect energy.




                                                                                                           Page 5
Biological Resources
The EIR will provide a description of the existing biological resources on each of the three campuses, a
discussion of potential impacts including tree removal, and appropriate mitigation and/or avoidance
measures will be included in the EIR.
Cultural Resources
The EIR will evaluate potential impacts to historical resources, archaeological resources, and human
remains. Potential impacts include the inadvertent discovery of unknown buried resources and altering the
character of historic resources. The EIR will identify mitigation and/or avoidance measures for significant
impacts to cultural resources, as appropriate.
Geology and Soils
The EIR will describe geologic and soil constraints and potential geologic and seismic hazards that could
result in Project impacts, which could also include loss of top soil and erosion from grading. The EIR will
identify mitigation and/or avoidance measures for significant geology and soils impacts, as appropriate.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The EIR will describe the existing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at each of the campuses, the Project’s
impacts to climate change and climate change’s impacts to the Project, and mitigation measures designed to
reduce the significance of Project-related climate change impacts.
Hazards and Hazardous Materials
There may be hazardous materials issues associated with building demolition (e.g., asbestos) and with
serpentine soils at all three campuses. The EIR will discuss site hazards on the basis of available mapping of
hazards and information in the Department of Toxic Substances Control database. In analyzing the Project’s
potential impacts, the EIR will take into account standard code requirements and best management
practices for the handling of hazardous materials. Mitigation measures will be identified to reduce
significant hazardous materials impacts, as appropriate.
Hydrology and Water Quality
The EIR will describe potential effects on hydrology and water quality, including stormwater drainage and
the potential for flooding on the site, and will identify appropriate mitigation and/or avoidance measures
for these impacts. In addition, the EIR will describe impacts from stormwater runoff and drainage from the
proposed development. The impact analysis will identify any additional mitigation to avoid significant
impacts, if necessary.
Land Use and Planning
The EIR will describe the existing land uses on and adjacent to the Project site, and the Project’s
compatibility with existing and planned land uses on and adjacent to the campuses. It is important to note
that the College District Board of Trustees has exempted the 2015 Facilities Master Plan Amendment
project from the application of city and county zoning ordinances. At Skyline College, the proposed future
housing will be examined on the basis of its consistency with the City of San Bruno General Plan in
coordination with the City. Housing is not exempt from zoning because it is not a classroom use. Land use
impacts resulting from the proposed uses on the site will be addressed. Mitigation and/or avoidance
measures will be identified for significant land use impacts, as appropriate.



                                                                                                        Page 6
Noise
The EIR will evaluate noise and vibration impacts associated with construction and operation of the Project.
Existing noise conditions at each of the three campuses will be described. The EIR will also address the
compatibility of the proposed uses with the Project site’s existing and future noise exposure, offsite impacts
resulting from onsite noise sources, Project-generated traffic noise impacts to sensitive receptors in the
area, and the temporary noise increase during Project construction. Mitigation and/or avoidance measures
will be identified for significant noise impacts, as appropriate.
Population and Housing
The EIR will examine the Project’s potential to effect population and housing. This section will discuss
qualitatively the housing supply and demand in the context of Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG) regional household forecasts and fair share housing allocations. Mitigation measures will be
identified that would avoid or reduce significant impacts to population and housing.
Public Services and Utilities
The EIR will identify existing public services, systems utilities, and service providers. The analysis will
examine whether existing public services and utilities are sufficient to serve the Project and the impacts, if
any, of expanding public services if that is necessary. Existing public services and utilities and providers in
the Project area will be identified to determine the needs of the new facilities. The analysis will also
evaluate the Project’s effects on public services and utility disruption, if any, and mitigation measures will
be identified that would avoid or reduce significant impacts to public services and utilities, if necessary.
Recreation
The EIR will examine the extent to which the Project may affect nearby recreation areas or create the need
for new recreation areas. Existing recreational facilities in the campus areas will be identified to determine
whether any such facilities would be disrupted during Project construction. An assessment will be
performed to determine whether Project implementation would result in substantial increase in demand
for recreational facilities such that new or improved facilities would be required. The Project includes a
public Health Club and Aquatic Center at the new Kinesiology/Wellness Building on the Cañada College
campus that would be available to the public; this is an addition to recreation uses in the area. Mitigation
measures will be identified that would avoid or reduce significant impacts to recreation, if necessary.
Transportation/Traffic
The EIR will describe the existing transportation network and evaluate the Project’s traffic impacts. The
EIR will analyze construction-related traffic impacts at each campus. An operations or trip generation
analysis will be conducted for the public Health Club and Aquatic Center located at the
Kinesiology/Wellness Building at Cañada College and the new residential development proposed at Skyline
College. Mitigation and/or avoidance measures will be identified for any significant traffic impacts.
Cumulative Impacts
In accordance with CEQA, the EIR will address the impacts of implementing this Project in combination
with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects in San Mateo County and neighboring
jurisdictions. The EIR will identify the Project’s contribution to cumulative impacts and, if necessary,
mitigation to reduce the contribution to a less than significant level.




                                                                                                          Page 7
Alternatives to the Project
In accordance with CEQA, the EIR will qualitatively evaluate a reasonable range of potentially feasible
alternatives to the Project and a “No Project” alternative. Alternatives will be identified based on their
ability to meet most of the Project objectives but reduce or avoid significant environmental impacts, and
will likely include a reduced intensity alternative.
Other CEQA Sections
The EIR will include other sections required by CEQA, including Significant Unavoidable Impacts,
Significant Irreversible Environmental Changes, Growth-inducing Impacts, Authors and Consultants,
References, and Technical Appendices.

Re: Notice of Preparation of an Environmental Impact Report for the San Mateo County
    Community College District 2015 Public Facilities Master Plan Amendment

Dear Ms. Christensen,

Thank you for notifying the City of San Bruno of the opportunity to comment on the scope and
content of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) being prepared for the San Mateo County
Community College District 2015 Facilities Master Plan Amendment. All of the City’s comments
apply to the Skyline campus projects. The City has a particular interest making sure that the EIR
evaluates potential environmental impacts that may affect surrounding neighborhoods, City
infrastructure and public services:
1. Project Description. Describe the residential project at Skyline College as completely as
   possible, both the single family homes and multi-family staff/faculty housing, including the
   layout of streets and lots, approximate size of lots and units, estimated persons per
   household, and targeted household income.
   Describe the overall construction timeline for all projects on the Skyline campus.
2. Aesthetics. Evaluate the visual impacts of the proposed residential project, including
   appearance from College Drive and surrounding residences. Evaluate the compatibility of
   scale and design of the residential project(s) with the surrounding Pacific Heights residential
   neighborhood. Analyze the consistency of the new residential development with the City’s
   zoning regulations and Residential Design Guidelines.
3. Geology and Soils. Skyline College is in proximity to San Andreas Fault and Alquist-Priolo
   Earthquake Fault Zone. Geotechnical and soils reports should evaluate the potential
   impacts of grading the residential subdivision and its potential impacts on the surrounding
   residential neighborhoods, storm drain infrastructure, and City streets.
4. Hazards and Hazardous Materials. Describe as thoroughly as possible the demolition
   component of the project, especially the demolition of the Social Science/Creative Arts
   Building 1 (78,000 square feet) and Building 19 (39,000 square feet), including timing,
   estimated tons of demolition and construction debris, hazardous materials, transport of
   debris, and planned haul routes through the City.

Notes:
Table developed by Hexagon Transportation Consultants.
1. Based on 2015 January Check-Ins Data collected by SMCCCD. There were 5,380 members as of January 2015.
2. AM peak hour check-ins & -outs include 84 check-ins in 8-9 am and 52 check-ins in 7-8 am which was assumed to exit in 8-9 am.
3. PM peak hour check-ins & -outs include 94 check-ins in 5-6 pm and 65 check-ins in 4-5 pm which was assumed to exit in 5-6 pm.
4. It was assumed that faculty, staff, and student members go to the club before and after work or school, so they don't generate additional vehicle trips.
   Therefore, check-ins were calculated for the general public (GP) members, using the ratio of GP members to all members.
5. Daily and peak-hour trip rates were calculated using chick-ins from GP members. It is assumed one vehicle trip per check-in.

Dear: Mr. Christensen

We are sending this official species list in response to your April 14, 2015 request for information about
endangered and threatened species. The list covers the California counties and/or U.S. Geological Survey 7½
minute quad or quads you requested.

Our database was developed primarily to assist Federal agencies that are consulting with us. Therefore, our lists
include all of the sensitive species that have been found in a certain area and also ones that may be affected by
projects in the area. For example, a fish may be on the list for a quad if it lives somewhere downstream from that
quad. Birds are included even if they only migrate through an area. In other words, we include all of the species
we want people to consider when they do something that affects the environment.

Please read Important Information About Your Species List (below). It explains how we made the list and
describes your responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act.

Our database is constantly updated as species are proposed, listed and delisted. If you address proposed and
candidate species in your planning, this should not be a problem. However, we recommend that you get an
updated list every 90 days. That would be July 13, 2015.

Please contact us if your project may affect endangered or threatened species or if you have any questions about
the attached list or your responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act. A list of Endangered Species Program
contacts can be found here.

How We Make Species Lists



http://www.fws.gov/sacramento/ES_Species/Lists/es_species_lists.cfm                                                   11/20/2013

We store information about endangered and threatened species lists by U.S. Geological
Survey 7½ minute quads. The United States is divided into these quads, which are about the
size of San Francisco.

The animals on your species list are ones that occur within, or may be affected by projects
within, the quads covered by the list.
    z   Fish and other aquatic species appear on your list if they are in the same watershed as your
        quad or if water use in your quad might affect them.
    z   Amphibians will be on the list for a quad or county if pesticides applied in that area may be
        carried to their habitat by air currents.
    z   Birds are shown regardless of whether they are resident or migratory. Relevant birds on the
        county list should be considered regardless of whether they appear on a quad list.

Plants
Any plants on your list are ones that have actually been observed in the area covered by the
list. Plants may exist in an area without ever having been detected there. You can find out
what's in the surrounding quads through the California Native Plant Society's online
Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants.

Surveying
Some of the species on your list may not be affected by your project. A trained biologist
and/or botanist, familiar with the habitat requirements of the species on your list, should
determine whether they or habitats suitable for them may be affected by your project. We
recommend that your surveys include any proposed and candidate species on your list.
See our Protocol and Recovery Permits pages.
For plant surveys, we recommend using the Guidelines for Conducting and Reporting
Botanical Inventories. The results of your surveys should be published in any environmental
documents prepared for your project.

Your Responsibilities Under the Endangered Species Act
All animals identified as listed above are fully protected under the Endangered Species Act of
1973, as amended. Section 9 of the Act and its implementing regulations prohibit the take of
a federally listed wildlife species. Take is defined by the Act as "to harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect" any such animal.
        Take may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or
        injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding,
        feeding, or shelter (50 CFR §17.3).

Take incidental to an otherwise lawful activity may be authorized by one of two
procedures:
    z   If a Federal agency is involved with the permitting, funding, or carrying out of a project that may
        result in take, then that agency must engage in a formal consultation with the Service.
        During formal consultation, the Federal agency, the applicant and the Service work together to
        avoid or minimize the impact on listed species and their habitat. Such consultation would result
        in a biological opinion by the Service addressing the anticipated effect of the project on listed and
        proposed species. The opinion may authorize a limited level of incidental take.
    z   If no Federal agency is involved with the project, and federally listed species may be taken as
