INTRODUCTION

The following report was prepared in order to address the traffic related impacts of the
proposed new Lake Forest Park Condominium development in the city of Lake Forest
Park. A vicinity map is shown in Figure 1.

This study evaluates the project’s AM and PM peak hour impacts at three off-site
intersections identified by the City. These include SR 522/NE 153rd St, SR 522/NE 147th
St (PM only), and SR 522/NE 145th St. The study also includes a review of project traffic
impact on neighborhood roadways in the vicinity of the site.

Project Identification

The Lake Forest Condos project would be constructed on a single parcel, 156810-0670,
located at 14727 35th Ave NE. The total parcel area is 8,706 gsf and there is currently
one vacant/abandoned single family home on the property.

The proposed project will consist of 16 condominium units. There will be a 22-stall
parking garage on the ground floor. The parking garage will take access to 35th Ave NE
with a 20-foot wide driveway that is proposed at 33 feet from the south property line to
center of driveway.

The site plan is presented in Figure 2.

Roadways

Key roadways serving the site are discussed below.

SR 522 is a 5- to 6-lane principal arterial (major highway) in the vicinity of the project.
Side street access for local street and driveways is typically restricted to right-in and right-
out movements with some designated left turn pockets. SR 522 consists of two general
purpose lanes each direction, plus a designated bus lane (outside lane) in the southbound
direction. There are bus pullouts at bus stops for the northbound direction. The posted
speed limit is 40 mph north of NE 145th St and 35 mph south of it.

NE 145th St is a 4-lane arterial west of SR 522 (outside the City limits) and a 2-lane local
access roadway east of SR 522 (south City limits boundary line). The roadway east of SR
522 is straight but with a vertical curve between SR 522 and 37th Ave NE. In this section,
the roadway is approximately 22 feet wide with sporadic gravel shoulders, along with fog

lines and a yellow center skip strip. The posted speed is 25 mph this section. The
Southern Gateway Village project will be improving the roadway along its’ frontage
southside.

NE 153rd St is a two-way east-west local access roadway with no access (dead-end) east
of 37th Ave NE. The roadway has a relatively steep downgrade east of 37th Ave NE. The
speed limit is 25 mph.

35th Ave NE is a two-way north-south local access roadway that connects between NE
147th St and NE 148th St. The roadway is paved approximately 18- to 20-feet in width, is
level, and has no channelization markings. There are sporadic gravel shoulders in some
areas that are being used for parallel parking just off the roadway pavement. The posted
speed limit is 25 mph.

NE 147th St is a two-way east-west local access roadway that connects between SR 522
and east past NE 37th St. In the vicinity of 35th Ave NE, the roadway is 24 to 26 feet wide
with some parallel parking (on gravel on north side and on the pavement south side) west
of 35th Ave NE. East of 35th Ave NE the roadway narrows to 22 feet approximately and
has some vertical curves nearing 37th Ave NE. The north section of this roadway east of
35th Ave NE is presumed to be improved with the Southern Gateway Village
development. The posted speed limit is 25 mph.

NE 148th St is a two-way east-west local access roadway that connects between 35th Ave
NE and east towards Lake Washington, with some steep slopes nearing 38th Pl NE. In the
vicinity of the site, the roadway is approximately 24 wide with parallel parking (on
gravel/paved areas outside both sides of the roadway. The posted speed limit is 25 mph.

NE 150th St (north of NE 148th St) & 37th Ave NE (south of NE 153rd St) are two-way
north-south local access roadways that provide connection between NE 148th St and NE
153rd St. The roadway is residential in character, roadway pavement is approximately 28
feet in width (for the majority). There are curb, gutter for most of the section as well.
The roadway grade is curvilinear both horizontally and vertically. The posted speed is 25
mph.

37th Ave NE (south of NE 147th St) is a north-south two-way local access street. The
roadway is straight but has a relatively steep incline from NE 147th St to NE 145th St.
The roadway width is 22 to 24 feet wide with some gravel shoulder areas for parallel
parking. The posted speed limit is 25 mph.

Intersection Geometrics and Signal Operations

The SR 522/NE 153rd St intersection is signalized. The roadway channelization is:

    •   Northbound approach – four lane with u-turn pocket, two thru lanes and small
        right turn pocket that extends through the intersection to a bus stop zone.
    •   Southbound approach – four lane approach including a left turn lane (u-turns
        permitted), two thru lanes, and a bus only lane.
    •   Westbound approach – a single lane approach for left and right turn movements.
    •   The signal operates as an actuated signal. It includes protected left-turn and u-turn
        phasing for the north and south approaches, the east approach is obviously split
        phase. There are pedestrian crosswalks on the north and east legs only.

The SR 522/NE 145th St intersection is signalized. The roadway channelization is:

    •   Northbound approach – four lane with left turn pocket, two thru lanes and bus
        only lane that transitions into a right turn pocket. The bus lane extends
        approximately 290 feet north of the intersection where it then merges with the two
        thru lanes.
    •   Southbound approach – four lane approach including a left turn lane (u-turns
        permitted), two thru lanes, and a bus lane that transitions into a right turn pockets.
        The bus lane does not extend through the intersection.
    •   Eastbound approach – a three lane approach with a left turn lane, a shared left/thru
        lane, and a right turn pocket.
    •   Westbound approach – a three lane approach with a left turn pocket, a thru lane,
        and a right turn pocket.
    •   The signal operates as an actuated signal. It includes protected left turn phasing
        for the north and south legs, the east and west approaches are split phase. There
        are pedestrian crosswalks all legs.

The SR 522/NE 147th St intersection is non-signalized. The roadway channelization is:

    •   Northbound approach – two thru lanes.
    •   Southbound approach – four lane approach including a left turn pocket, two thru
        lanes, and a bus only lane.
    •   Westbound approach – a single lane approach with stop sign. The only permitted
        movement is a right turn.
    •   This intersection is side-street stop control. The southbound left turn is of course
        a yield movement.

Other two-way stop control intersections include:

    •   35th Ave NE at NE 147th St.


William Popp Associates                                                                 Page 3
Traffic Impact Analysis (5/21/15)                                         Lake Forest Condos




     •   37th Ave NE at NE 147th St.
     •   37th Ave NE at NE 153rd St.

The intersection of NE 145th St/37th Ave NE is an all-way stop control intersection. The
intersections of NE 150th St/37th Ave NE and NE 148th St/NE 150th St have no designated
sign controlled movements.

Pedestrian Facilities

The pedestrian facilities in the neighborhood areas east of SR 522 are limited with
minimal shoulder and sidewalk locations. However, all of the roadways are local access
type streets and are presumed to be low volume streets thus walking along the edge of the
roadway is presumed to be adequate.

SR 522 has sidewalks on both sides of the roadway. There are pedestrian crosswalks at
the adjacent signalized intersections at NE 153rd St and NE 145th St.

Transit Service

Transit service in the region is provided by the King County Department of
Transportation (Metro Transit) and Sound Transit. There are bus stops on both sides of
SR 522 at the NE 153rd St intersection. The stops serve Metro Routes 308, 309, 312, and
372 and Sound Transit Route 522.

There are three bus stops in the vicinity of the SR 522/NE 145th St intersection. The bus
stop on SR 522 just north of NE 145th St serves Metro Routes 308, 309, 312, and 372 and
Sound Transit Route 522. The bus stop on SR 522 just south of NE 145th St serves Metro
Routes 309, 312, 330, and 372 and Sound Transit Route 522. The bus stop on NE 145th
St just west of SR 522 serves Metro Routes 308, and 330.

2.       Traffic Volumes

Existing AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected Tuesday May
19, 2015 at each of the analysis intersections, except at the SR 522/NE 145th St location
for the AM peak period where an older count (Nov-2013) was provided by the City.

The 2013 AM count at SR 522/NE 145th St was adjusted for selected heavier movements
on SR 522 and west leg of NE 145th St in an effort to match the two-way volumes on SR
522 south of NE 153rd St from the recent count this month.

All of the peak hour turning movement counts are presented in Attachment 1 of the
Technical Appendix.

A summary of the existing 2015 AM and PM peak hour volumes at the analysis
intersections are presented in Attachment 2 of the Technical Appendix.

Several daily counts were collected by WPA from WSDOT for the approaches at the
signalized intersections analyzed in this TIA. The daily counts are a bit old, of the 2011
and 2012 era, however the intent is to show the hourly fluctuations by approach at each
location.

The first figure shows the volumes at the SR 522/SR 523 (aka NE 145th St) intersection.

As shown in Figure 3, there is a pronounced heavy volume southbound in the AM
however, for the PM peak period the volume is almost the same. The eastbound
approach volume also peak in the PM period, as well as the westbound approach.

Similar to Figure 4, there is a pronounced heavy volume southbound in the AM however,
for the PM peak period the volume is almost the same.

3.                        Level-of-Service

Level-of-service (LOS) is a term defined by transportation and traffic engineers as a
qualitative and quantitative measure of operational conditions within a traffic stream and
the perception of these conditions by motorists and/or passengers. There are several
quantitative indices utilized depending on the type of intersection control present. There
are six levels-of-service that are given letter designations from "A" to "F", with "A" being
the best, or minimum delay conditions, and "F" being the worst, with maximum delay or
jammed conditions. LOS "C" or "D" is generally considered acceptable for planning and
design purposes, while LOS "E" represents operating conditions at or near capacity with
freedom to maneuver being extremely difficult.

Level-of-service for the existing condition was calculated using Trafficware’s Synchro
software. This software replicates the analytical procedures specified in the Highway
Capacity Manual. The level of service criteria are shown in Table 1. Level-of-service for
signalized and non-signalized intersections is quantified in terms of vehicular delay.
Delay, measured in terms of time (seconds), also represents driver discomfort, frustration,
excess fuel consumption and lost travel time.

Note that for signalized intersections, the delay presented represents the overall operation
of the intersection, whereas the delay presented for unsignalized intersections represents
the delay for the critical approach or movement. The results are presented in this manner
since the overall intersection delay at a non-signalized intersection is generally quite good
because the major through street maneuvers are not impeded and for the most part carry
the majority of the traffic. It is also important to note that the level of service results from
the Synchro output do not fully take into consideration the queue spill back from
upstream or downstream signalized intersections and the additional congestion that may
occur.

The existing level of service at the analysis intersections is presented in Table 2.

c    The AM and PM peak hours are in general the peak one hour between 7:00-9:00am, and 4:00-6:00 pm.




The SR 522/NE 153rd St signalized intersection is estimated to operate at LOS A for the
AM peak hour and LOS B for the PM peak hour. It is important to note that the delay
presented in Table 2 and the corresponding LOS is representative for the whole
intersection, all approaches. The LOS analysis assumes an actuated-uncoordinated signal
with a cycle length of 180 seconds for both the AM and PM peak hours. The cycle length
was observed for the PM peak and assumed for the AM peak.

At the SR 522/NE 147th St intersection, only analyzed for the PM peak hour, the
southbound left turn movement is estimated to operate at LOS D. The westbound right
turn movement from NE 147th St is estimated to operate at LOS E. The City indicated
that no LOS analysis was required for the AM peak hour. Excess delay can be incurred
due to queue spill back from NE 153rd St, however, in certain situations when this
occurred, southbound left turn movements and westbound right turn movements were
observed to be waived across or waived in the queue.

The SR 522/NE 145th St signalized intersection is estimated to operate at LOS D for the
AM peak hour and LOS E for the PM peak hour. Again, the delay and LOS is
representative for the whole intersection, all approaches. The LOS analysis assumes an
actuated-uncoordinated signal with an observed cycle length of 220 seconds for the PM
peak hour and an assumed 180 second cycle for the AM intersection cycle length.

The existing level of service results are presented in Attachment 3 of the Technical
Appendix.

4.      Sight Distance

There are two sight distance parameters generally applicable to new access scenarios.
One is intersection (or entering) sight distance (ISD/ESD) from project driveways and the
other is stopping sight distance (SSD). For a low volume driveway such as the one
proposed accessing a low volume residential street, typically only the stopping sight
distance condition is considered.

The radius of the 35th Ave NE/NE 148th St curve is approximately 55 feet along the
center of road. The calculated design speed for this conditions with 0% superelevation is
approximately 15 mph (per AASHTO Exhibit 3-16). Based on a design speed of 15 mph,
the minimum required stopping sight distance is 80 feet. Assuming a 20 mph speed, the
SSD is 110 feet.

Given the proposed location of the project driveway, 33 feet north of south property line,
the estimated sight line looking northeast to NE 148th St is approximately 110 feet. The
sight line looking south extends all the way to NE 147th St.

A sight distance sketch is included in Attachment 5 of the Technical Appendix.


B. FUTURE CONDITIONS

1.      Background Traffic Volumes

Background traffic volumes are typically estimated by factoring the existing traffic
volumes by historical traffic growth rate(s) to the project's horizon year and adding in
known pipeline development proposals. The project’s estimated horizon year was
assumed to be 2 years out from this study date, thus 2017.

The City’s Southern Gateway Sub-Area Plan Draft EIS for traffic forecasts indicates that
growth on SR 522 would range between approximately 0.2% to 0.4% per year from 2012
to 2030. Traffic growth for the area east of SR 522 was assumed to be negligible except
for known development such as the Southern Gateway Village development.

The recent PM turning movement counts conducted at the three SR 522 intersections of
the study area when compared against the 2012 counts in the Draft EIS indicate a mix of
positive and negative growth. The PM total entering volume at the SR 522/NE 153rd St
intersection increased slightly at 0.16% from 2012 to 2015. The PM volume at the SR
522/NE 147th St intersection was down 3.8%, and the PM volume at the SR 522/NE 145th
St intersection was down 6.1%.


William Popp Associates                                                                Page 9
Traffic Impact Analysis (5/21/15)                                              Lake Forest Condos




For this analysis, the 2015 counts were used as the basis for all future forecasts. The
2013 AM count at the SR 522/NE 145th St intersection which was used for this study,
was adjusted to 2015 to match the south leg volumes (to a closer degree) at the SR
522/NE 153rd St intersection. The annual growth rate assumed was 0.5% per year for all
SR 522 through traffic, 0.5% per year for all traffic on NE 145th St (SR 523) west of SR
522, and 1.0% per year for all roadways east of SR 522.

The Southern Gateway Village project trips were included in the 2017 background
volume forecasts. An estimate of AM trips for this development assumed 70% of the PM
traffic with all movements in the reverse direction.

Year 2017 AM and PM background volumes are presented in Attachment 2 of the
Technical Appendix.

2.      Project Trip Generation

The Lake Forest Condos plat consists of 16 new condominium units. There is one vacant
and abandoned home on the site that will be demolished. However, for this traffic study,
no trip credit adjustment was assumed for the home removed, as it may have been vacant
for quite some time.

The trip generation estimates are based on the ITE Trip Generation manual 8th Edition for
Land Use Code 230; Condominium/Townhome (ITE LUC 230). The trip generation
estimates for the project are presented in Table 3.

                                              Table 3

As shown in Table 3, the project site is estimated to generate 93 average weekday daily
trips, 7 AM, and 8 PM peak hour trips.

As noted above, for the future operations analysis summarized later herein, no trip credit
was taken for the home removed and subsequent trip removed as it is assumed the home
has been vacant for more than a few years, plus the credit is really an insignificant
difference not worth discussion or analysis.

3.      Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment

The project trip distribution percentages for AM and PM peak hour analysis were based
on traffic volumes of the major roadways in the site vicinity, as well as professional
judgment regarding known significant employment and socio/rec/shop opportunities.

This analysis assumes 25% of the project trips to/from the north on SR 522, 35% of the
project trips to/from the south on SR 522, and 40% of the project trips to/from the west
on NE 145th St

The AM and PM peak hour project trips are presented in Figure 5.

4.      Background Traffic Plus Project Traffic Volumes

Year 2017 PM peak hour with-project traffic volumes were developed by adding project
trips to the year 2017 background traffic volumes.

The traffic volume increases at each of the analysis intersections is relatively
insignificant. The impact at each are discussed as follows:

      SR 522/NE 153rd St. The total entering volume for the PM peak hour in 2017
       with project is 4,242. The project volume at this intersection is 2 PM peak hour
       trips (also 2 for the AM peak hour). The resultant project volume impact is
       0.05%.

      SR 522/NE 147th St. The total entering volume for the PM peak hour in 2017
       with project, excluding the SB through volume, is 2,613. The project volume at
       this intersection is 6 PM peak hour trips (3 for the AM peak hour). The resultant
       project volume impact is 0.23%.

      SR 522/NE 145th St. The total entering volume for the PM peak hour in 2017
       with project is 4,582. The project volume at this intersection is 6 PM peak hour
       trips (5 for the AM peak hour). The resultant project volume impact is 0.13%.

The Year 2017 AM and PM peak hour with project volumes are shown in Attachment 2
of the Technical Appendix.

5.      Level-of-Service (2017 with and without Project)

Level-of-service for the 2017 with- and without-project conditions were calculated for the
subject analysis intersections. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 4. For
comparison purposes, level-of-service values for 2015 are also presented. All of the

a    LOS and Delay; delay represented in seconds per vehicle. LOS and delay represent overall intersection approach delay.
b    All counts were conducted May 19, 2015, except for the AM count at SR 522/NE 145th St which was adjusted to 2015 from a
     Nov-2013 count.
c    The background traffic forecast assumes 0.5%/yr on SR 522 and SR 523, and 1.0%/yr on all roadways east of SR 522. Southern
     Gateway Village is included in the background forecasts.




The SR 522/NE 153rd St signalized intersection is estimated to operate at LOS A for the
AM peak hour and LOS B for the PM peak hour for both existing and future project
horizon year conditions. It is important to note that the delay presented in Table 2 and the
corresponding LOS is representative for the whole intersection, all approaches.

At the SR 522/NE 147th St intersection, only analyzed for the PM peak hour, the
southbound left turn movement is estimated to operate at LOS D. The westbound right
turn movement from NE 147th St is estimated to operate at LOS E. The City indicated
that no LOS analysis was required for the AM peak hour.

The SR 522/NE 145th St signalized intersection is estimated to operate at LOS D for the
AM peak hour and LOS E for the PM peak hour. Again, the delay and LOS is
representative for the whole intersection, all approaches.

The site access is assumed to operate at LOS A, however no level of service analysis was
conducted.

All of the level of results are included in Attachment 3 of the Technical Appendix.

     back to NE 145th St (next signal) which is an additional 700 feet. Total distance between NE 145th St and NE 153rd St is
     approximately 2,350 feet.
c This is the distance of NE 147th St from SR 522 to 35th Ave NE. NE 147th St extends east 1,000’ +.
d This is the distance of NE 145th St thru lane from SR 522 to the all-way stop at 37th Ave NE.
# sign indicates queue exceeds storage capacity, actual queue may be longer.




As shown in Table 5, there are a few instances where average queue and 95th percentile
queues exceed link length or turn pocket storage length.

The northbound thru queue on SR 522 and NE 153rd St is estimated to extend back
(south) on average approximately 1,300 feet for future conditions with project. The 95th
percentile queue is estimated to extend south past NE 147th St. The average queue or the
95th percentile queue does not significantly change with project traffic.

The estimated queues for conditions with project at the SR 522/NE 147th St intersection
are estimated to be adequate in so much as they are predicted to be less than the storage
available, in particular the southbound left turn pocket. The southbound left queue may
be longer than shown in Table 5 as northbound queues begin to block the left-turn-across
movement, however, as traffic slows to a stop, it is assumed that northbound motorists
will permit (allow space) for vehicles to make a left turn across during peak congestion.
It is also estimated that during peak congestion, motorists turning right from NE 147th St
to SR 522 will be waived in during stopped queue conditions on SR 522. In any case, the

increase queue length (average or 95th) is not estimated to significantly different with or
without project traffic.

At the SR 522/NE 145th St intersection, the queue analysis is shown for only the
westbound approach. The queue results in the appendix identify results for all
movements. For the westbound approach, the average queue for the left turn pocket is
estimated to be less than the storage available, however, the 95th percentile queue is
estimated to be longer, for all cases. The 95th percentile queue is estimated to only
increase by 3 feet with project traffic. For the westbound through lane movement, not a
storage pocket, the queue is not estimated to significantly increase with project traffic.
The westbound right turn queue is estimated to exceed storage for both the average and
95th percentile queue. However, with the project the queue does not change. This is due
to the fact there are no project trips estimated to use the right turn pocket.

The queue results are included in Attachment 4 of the Technical Appendix.


C. CONCLUSIONS

1.      Project Details

The proposed project will consist of 16 condominium units. There will be a 22-stall
parking garage on the ground floor. The parking garage will take access to 35th Ave NE
with a 20-foot wide driveway that is proposed at 33 feet from the south property line to
center of driveway.

The project would be constructed on a single parcel, 156810-0670, located at 14727 35th
Ave NE. The total parcel area is 8,706 gsf and there is currently one vacant/abandoned
single family home on the property.

2.      Traffic Volumes

The PM peak hour volume on SR 522 in the vicinity of the project is estimated to be
approximately 4,100 vehicles per hour (vph) in 2017 (2,540 vph northbound, and 1,560
vph southbound +/-). The AM peak hour volume in 2017 is estimated to be 3,500 vph
(1,250 northbound, and 2,250 southbound). The peak hour volume peak direction is near
capacity for the roadway.

The estimated volume on NE 147th St east of SR 522 is approximately 90 vehicles during
the PM peak hour (40 westbound, 50 eastbound). This roadway is generally a residential
character type street, daily volumes are not estimated to exceed 2,000 vehicles per day
which is typically a rule-of-thumb measurement for a residential livable street. A PM
peak hour volume of 90 vehicles would translate into approximately 900 vehicles per day.

3.      Transit and Non-Motorized Trips

The area is well served by transit including five routes north and south on SR 522 with
bus stops in the vicinity of the project. The southbound stop is accessible via signalized
crossing at the SR 522/NE 153rd St intersection.

There are sidewalks on both sides of SR 522 for safe pedestrian access. The
neighborhood roadways east of SR 522 within vicinity of the site are neighborhood
roadways that are safe for pedestrian walking, even though no designated sidewalks or
walkways exist.

4.      Project Trip Generation

With 16 new condominium units, the project is estimated to 93 average weekday daily
trips, 7 AM, and 8 PM peak hour trips.

This project volume estimate is considered an insignificant traffic increase to the
neighborhood roadways as well as arterial roads and intersections.

For comparison discussion, it is important to note the City’s Southern Gateway Sub-Area
Plan DEIS has identified existing 2012 and future 2030 traffic (Preferred Alternative) for
the area that this project is located in. The area is identified as Zone 15, which is bound
by SR 522 to the west, 35th Ave NE to the east, NE 148th St to the north, and NE 147th St
to the south. All of the current land uses in this zone are estimated to generate 41 PM
peak hour trips. The 2030 Preferred Alternative assumes redevelopment of this zone to
include 52 low-rise dwelling units, 2,879 gsf retail, and 5,758 gsf office space. The total
trip generation for this zone in 2030 is estimated to be 54 PM peak hour trips.

It is assumed that this project, 16 condominium units (low rise in general), is consistent
with the assumptions of the City’s DEIS.

5.      Project Trip Distribution and Assignment and Neighborhood Impacts

The project’s trip distribution pattern assumed a 25% - 75% distribution north and
respectively for project trips.

For the trips north, that would consist of 2 peak hour trips (AM or PM). It is assumed
these trips would use NE 147th St to SR 522 in lieu of access through neighborhood
roadways to NE 153rd St. Travel time estimates and predictions suggest that with SR 522
conditions per the LOS calculations, the SR 522 route is approximately 50 seconds faster
than local access streets, thus it is estimated that minimal trips from the project would use
the local access connection. Of course with heavier than predicted congestion on SR 522,
the alternate local access route may become more appealing. Nevertheless, the estimated



William Popp Associates                                                               Page 15
Traffic Impact Analysis (5/21/15)                                           Lake Forest Condos




number of trips from the project is only 2 peak hour trips for either the AM or PM peak
hour, thus even with the ‘diversion’ the impact is insignificant.

For trips to/from the south, that would equate to 6 PM and 5 AM peak hour trips, which
split to lesser numbers at the SR 522/NE 145th St intersection. The volume entering the
site are all assumed to turn right from SR 522 to NE 147th St and then to the project. For
project trips exiting the site, they will be required to traverse NE 147th St east, then 37th
Ave NE south, then NE 145th St west. The estimated peak hour volume is 2 trips for the
PM and 4 trips for the AM. Again, these low project volumes should be considered
insignificant to overall roadway volume impacts.

6.      Arterial Intersection Project Vehicular Impact

The project’s vehicular impact at the three analysis intersections is summarized herein
and is discussed as a percent of total vehicles entering the intersection.

At the SR 522/NE 153rd St intersection, the total future 2017 entering volume is
estimated at 3,558 vph for the AM peak hour and 4,242 for the PM peak hour. The
project volume is 2 peak hour trips for either peak hour, resulting in a percent impact of
only 0.06% and 0.05% respectively.

At the SR 522/NE 147th St intersection, the total future 2017 entering volume is estimated
at 4,186 vph for the PM peak hour. The project volume is 6 peak hour trips for the PM
peak (2 for the AM peak), resulting in a percent impact of only 0.14%.

At the SR 522/NE 145th St intersection, the total future 2017 entering volume is estimated
at 3,938 vph for the AM peak hour and 4,582 for the PM peak hour. The project volume
is 5 AM and 6 PM peak hour trips, resulting in a percent impact of only 0.13% and 0.13%
respectively.

7.      Level of Service

An AM and PM peak hour level of service analysis was conducted at the following three
intersections: 1) SR 522/NE 153rd St, 2) SR 522/NE 147th St (PM only), and 3) SR
522/NE 145th St.

At the SR 522/NE 153rd St intersection, the intersection is estimated to operate at LOS A
for the AM peak hour and LOS B for the PM peak hour for existing and future year
conditions. It should be noted the level of serve as presented represents the overall
intersection, some movements are worse.

At the SR 522/NE 147th St intersection, analyzed only for the PM peak hour, the
southbound left turn movement is estimated to operate at LOS D for existing and future



William Popp Associates                                                                Page 16
Traffic Impact Analysis (5/21/15)                                            Lake Forest Condos




conditions. The westbound right turn movement from NE 147th St to SR 522 is estimated
to operate at LOS E for all conditions.

At the SR 522/NE 145th St intersection, it is estimated to operate at LOS D for the AM
peak hour and LOS E for the PM peak hour. Again, the delay and LOS is representative
for the whole intersection, all approaches. Some movements will be worse.

8.      Sight Distance

A sight distance evaluation was conducted for stopping sight distance conditions (SSD)
only since the roadways that the project takes access to are neighborhood local access
type streets. Assuming the site access driveway is located per the details on the site plan
included in this study, the SSD looking to the northeast through the 35th Ave NE/NE
148th St curve is approximately 110 feet. The roadway curve follows a centerline radius
of about 55 feet. That would equate to a design speed of 15 mph. The minimum required
SSD per a 15 mph design speed is 80 feet, thus the SSD should be adequate. Assuming a
20 mph speed, the minimum SSD is 110 feet, thus the available SSD is adequate up
through a 20 mph design speed. Vegetation cutback and/or removal would be required to
increase the sight line and SSD.

9.      Queues

An analysis of queuing for both average queue and 95th percentile queue was conducted at
selected movements at each of the three analysis intersections. The full summary of
queue results are included in the appendix. The results of the queue analysis indicate that
the project will not significantly increase any of the queue lengths (average or 95th) for
those reported movements.


D. MITIGATION and RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the foregoing traffic impact analysis findings for the Lake Forest Condos
project, it is concluded that the project traffic impacts, LOS and resulting queues are
insignificant and are not likely to exacerbate or create any additional significant traffic
congestion or safety problems.

It is presumed that the project will construct frontage improvements in conjunction with
City standards along 35th Ave NE and through the 35th Ave NE/NE 148th St curve
including new asphalt, curb, gutter, and sidewalk the frontage length.

  Queue Results
that a level of service analysis be prepared for the SR522.NE 147th Street intersection during the AM
peak hour.

Level of Service Analysis
There are several issues identified in the level of service provided in the TIA which need further
analysis. Because of the extreme congestion on the SR 522 corridor, the level of service analysis
needs to provide an operational review rather than a planning level. What that means is the
parameters used in the level of service analysis should reflect current traffic signals timing parameters
and operational characteristics. Of specific concern are the following elements

      Peak Hour Factor – the TIA should document the origin of the peak hour factors used in each
       of the level of service analysis for the two (2) signalized intersections and one (1) stop sign
       controlled intersection. The peak hour factor (PHF) for each intersection is presented in the
       traffic count summaries attached in the Appendix. For example, the AM PHF at the SR
       522/NE 153rd by direction as presented in the idax AM peak period count is WB – 0.63; NB –
       0.89; SB – 0.88 whereas the values used in the existing Synchro AM peak hour level of
       service analysis was WB – 0.80.; NB – 0.99 with the exception of NBR which was 0.80; and
       SB – 0.99 with the exception of the SBL which was 0.80. Similar differences were observed
       in the other analysis sheets.
      Clearance Time – the TIA level of service analyses typically used a value of 4.0 seconds. It is
       suggested with the inclusion of the Yellow and All Red time for each phase these values
       should be higher by as much one (1) second which will add delay to each movement. Based
       on the posted speed of 40 miles per hour north of NE 145th Street, the calculated Yellow
       Clearance alone would be four (4) seconds without the addition of the All Red Clearance.
       The TIA should document and include the actual clearance times to create an operation LOS
       analysis.
      Level of Service Results – the TIA level of service analysis indicates the side street level of
       service in all analysis scenarios at failure (LOS F) or within three (3) seconds of delay of
       failure whereas the SR 522 intersections were typically analyzed to have acceptable and in
       some cases relatively high LOS.one. The issue here is the analysis needs to be refined and
       evaluated to determine what, if any traffic signal timing modifications can be made to
       improve overall traffic signal coordination along the SR 522 corridor.
      Queuing –the queuing analysis presented in the TIA indicate several movements have 95th
       percentile queues which exceed the storage capacity of the movement. In addition, the queue
       summaries are foot noted with the comment “Queue shown is maximum after two cycles,
       queue may be longer” and in some cases – “queue is theoretically infinite”. The level of
       service analysis needs to be refined to eliminate the footnotes and present a more realistic
       level of service.

No other issues were noted.

Conclusions
The overall assessment of the TIA is the relative impact of the Lake Forest Condominiums, even with
the suggested corrections, is insignificant in the overall traffic operations along the SR522 corridor in
the vicinity of the project. With that said, the traffic operations analysis should be refined to the point
to correctly determine if there are low cost operational improvements which, at a minimum, would
