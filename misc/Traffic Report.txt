210 Wall Street                                                                        March 2016



                                      Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a residential building with ground floor commercial use
located at 210 Wall Street in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. As necessary, mitigation
measures are identified that would offset or reduce significant transportation related impacts
that the proposed project may have on the surrounding transportation system.


Project Description
As shown in Figure 1, the proposed project is located on the currently vacant block bound by
2nd Avenue, the alley, Wall Street, and Vine Street in Seattle’s Belltown neighborhood. The
proposed project would develop up to 300 residential apartment units1 and 12,000 square
feet of ground floor commercial space. The proposed project would provide a total of
approximately 265 parking spaces within an underground parking garage. In addition, the
project is proposing to supply 317 bicycle parking spaces. Access to the parking garage
would be provided via the existing alley between Wall Street and Vine Street and limits
pedestrian interaction with project-generated vehicles to the alley entrances where it is
regularly expected. Figure 2 illustrates the preliminary site plan. It is anticipated that the
development would be constructed and occupied by 2018.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with City of Seattle Department of Planning and
Development (DPD) staff and is consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the area.
Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed projects, the following
intersections were evaluated:
      1. 2nd Avenue/ Vine Street
      2. Alley/ Vine Street
      3. 3rd Avenue/ Vine Street
      4. 2nd Avenue/Wall Street
      5. Alley/ Wall Street
      6. 3rd Avenue/ Wall Street
      7. 4th Avenue/ Wall Street
      8. 2nd Avenue/ Battery Street

The study focuses on the weekday PM peak hours when transportation impacts are
anticipated to be greatest. The report first describes existing and future (2018) without-project
conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the street system, existing and
future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety,
non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2018) with-project conditions are then
described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation system were identified by
comparing the future with-project conditions to the future without-project conditions.

    The anticipated mix of apartment units includes approximately 30 studio/open one-bedroom
     units, 196 one-bedroom units, and 74 two-bedroom units.

        Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing and future (2018) without-project conditions within the study
area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system, planned improvements,
existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety,
non-motorized facilities, and transit service.

Street System
The following describes the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed project
and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.
Existing
Characteristics of the existing street system in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is in the immediate vicinity of three to
four lane arterials. In addition, Wall Street, Vine Street, 2nd Avenue, and 4th Avenue are one-
way streets.

Future
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2016 – 2021 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) and WSDOT improvements, no transportation improvements were identified that would
impact the street system capacity and travel patterns in the study area.


Traffic Volumes
The following summarize the traffic volumes for existing and future (2018) without-project
conditions.
Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in October 2015. Figure 3 illustrates
the observed weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, rounded to
the nearest 5 vehicles. Detailed traffic count worksheets are provided in Appendix A.

Future
Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes and adding traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase traffic at study intersections. An annual growth rate
of 1.5 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at each
study intersection and is consistent with recent studies conducted in the area. Traffic from the
following pipeline projects were included in the future without-project volume forecasts:

        600 Wall Street: This project would develop 400 residential units and 1,200 square
         feet of retail.
        2100 7th Avenue/2101 7th Avenue: This project would develop 1,104,600 square
         feet of administrative office with ground floor retail.
        2116 4th Avenue: This project would develop 339 residential units and a 142-room
         hotel with 1,800 square feet of support retail.
        2202/2208 8th Avenue: This project would develop 447 residential units with 7,400
         square feet of retail.
        2200 7th Avenue/2201 8th Avenue/2204 7th Avenue: This project would develop
         178,600 square feet of office and 12,300 square feet of retail.
        2301 7th Avenue: This project would develop 686 residential units, 173,700 square
         feet of office and 10,700 square feet of retail.
        2400 3rd Avenue: This project would develop 40,600 square feet of office and
         13,500 square feet of retail.
        2720 4th Avenue: This project would develop 161 residential units and 6,100 square
         feet of retail.
        3031 Western Avenue: This project would develop 100 residential units.

Future (2018) without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour
of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection. Traffic
operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service
(LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM Peak hour traffic operations for existing and future (2018) without-project
conditions were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010) using the Synchro 9 software program. Pedestrian
and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of the
intersections. For future (2018) without-project conditions, signal timings were left unchanged
from existing conditions.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2018) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized in Table
2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, all intersections currently operate at LOS C or better during the
weekday PM peak hour. In 2018, with the anticipated growth in traffic, the intersections are
anticipated to experience slight increases in delay over current levels but would continue to
operate at LOS C or better with the exception of 3rd Avenue/ Vine Street, which would
operate at LOS D and experience an increase of 1 second of delay.


Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify any existing traffic
safety issues at the study intersections. The most recent three-year summary of accident
data from the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between
January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. In addition to the study intersections, mid-block
collision data along Wall Street, Vine Street, 2nd Avenue, and 3rd Avenue in the study area
were also analyzed. This information is summarized in Table 3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high accident location status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. As shown in Table 3, all
intersections and roadway segments were below these criteria.

SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the following year. The
review screens the previous year collisions for signalized intersections with 10 or more
collisions in a year, unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, and locations with 5
or more pedestrian or bike collisions. SDOT’s Draft 2014 Candidate Locations report has not
identified any HCLs in the study area consistent with the collision history review presented.

There was one fatality collision reported on Wall Street between 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue
in 2012, one block from the project site, and occurred between two vehicles. The road
conditions were reported as being dry with light condition reported as dark at 6:00 AM. Six
injuries and two fatalities were reported for this collision. Based on the circumstances of this
collision and otherwise low collision rate that falls below the City’s high collision rate criteria
along this roadway segment, this fatality collision is not indicative of any specific adverse
condition in the study area.

The study area was also reviewed for pedestrian and bicycle related collections. Throughout
the study area, there were 7 collisions involving pedestrians or bicycles, with no reported
fatalities and no specific intersections or mid-block locations reporting more than two
collisions. Generally, the pedestrian collisions were related to vehicle driver inattention or
poor weather conditions.



Non-Motorized Facilities
Sidewalks are provided on all streets in the study area and marked crosswalks exists at all
the signalized study intersections. No marked crosswalks currently exist at the unsignalized
intersections along Vine Street or at the alley intersections. On-street bicycle lanes are

                                    Project Impacts
This section documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding street system and
identifies potential mitigation measures where necessary.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site. The net new trips generated takes into
account the current trips on the network, which are being generated by the existing uses on-
site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then estimating
the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level
of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




Total person trips were developed for the existing and proposed uses based on trip rates
from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Average vehicle occupancy (AVO) was
estimated from the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365
Travel Estimating Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed residential apartments
and the specialty retail land use.

Residential person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the
total person trips by the estimated mode splits from the US Census 2009-2013 American
Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting Characteristics. The survey shows a 47
percent auto mode split for census tract 80.01 where the project is located. After applying the
auto mode split, residential person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by
assuming an AVO of 1.03 for this census tract.

The retail use would serve the local area including residents and employees living and
working nearby. This would result in a high proportion of walking trips to and from the
surrounding neighborhood. The analysis assumes that 15 percent of the retail customers
would drive to the site and a localized AVO of 1.10 and is consistent with previous studies.

Table 5 summarizes the estimated weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour trip generation
for the proposed and existing land uses. Detailed trip generation calculation worksheets are
provided in Appendix D.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in Table 5, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 1,100
new daily vehicle trips with 80 new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 100 new
vehicle trips during the PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were primarily based on
information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s OnTheMap, as well as guidance from the
Director’s Rule 5-2009 and a review of existing travel patterns in the project vicinity. This
approach is consistent with other previously approved studies near the project site.

OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where residents
are employed and workers live based on census data. For the residential component of the
project, the OnTheMap census data for where people work that live within a quarter-mile
radius of the proposed project was reviewed. The zip codes where people work and live were
evaluated to determine if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or
by other means. Trips closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations
are more likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the
Seattle City limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the expected outbound and inbound vehicle trip distribution
for the proposed residential and retail portion of the project. The weekday PM peak hour trips
were assigned to the study area based on the illustrated travel patterns, alley access
locations, and local one and two-way street configuration. The project would provide access
via the alley between 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue on Wall Street and Vine Street. The
distribution and assignment considers the primary travel routes within the gridded street
system where project impacts would be greatest. It is recognized that drivers may take
alternative routes; however, it is anticipated that impacts along these facilities would be less
than disclosed in this analysis.

Traffic Volume Impact
Project traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes to
form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2018 with-project traffic volumes are
shown on Figure 7. Table 6 summarizes the project traffic volume impact at the study
intersections during the weekday PM peak hour for the project site. The existing volumes
were redistributed to the alley locations under future (2018) with-project conditions to account
for full access from both directions.

As shown in Table 6, the percent traffic volume impacts generally range from approximately 1
to 18 percent at the off-site study during the PM peak hour. The higher project shares are due
to the low traffics volumes at the respective study intersections. The project would have the
greatest impact at the alley access on Vine Street and Wall Street during the PM peak hour.


Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as described for
existing and future (2018) without-project conditions and all intersection parameters such as
channelization, traffic control, and signal timing settings were consistent with those used in
the evaluation of future (2018) without-project conditions. A comparison of future without and
with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is summarized for the project site in
Table 7. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 7, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with little to no change in calculated delays or LOS. All study intersections would continue to
operate better than City of Seattle criteria with the addition of project generated traffic to the
study area.


Site Access Evaluation
The proposed project includes one underground parking garage designated for the residential
and retail uses. Access the garage would be provided via the alley between 2nd Avenue and
3rd Avenue. The alley access locations at Vine and Wall Streets are anticipated to operate at
LOS A and LOS B during the weekday PM peak hours (see Table 7, page 15).


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include South of Lake Union (8),
South of Jackson St (10.11) and East of CBD (12.12) as listed in Table 8. As a conservative
estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of each
screenline would extend across the screenlines.

2.   Direction: NB = Northbound, SB = Southbound, EB = Eastbound, WB = Westbound

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios less than the City v/c threshold; thus, the project
would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
demand of the project, and parking code requirements.
Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by an underground parking garage with a
total of 265 stalls. Access to the parking garage would be via the alley between Wall and Vine
Streets. Additionally, 317 bicycle parking stalls would be provided with the proposed project.

Demand
The parking demand for the proposed project is expected to be below national averages due
the project’s proximity to transit service and its location in Belltown, a high-density urban
village with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The peak parking
demand for the proposed project was estimated based on national data adjusted to reflect
local conditions and is consistent with approved traffic studies conducted in the vicinity of the
site. Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix E.

Residential Component. Parking demand for the residential component of the project was
based on US Census vehicle ownership data.2 The site is located in census tract 80.01 and
the proposed apartment unit breakdown includes 30 studio or open one-bedroom units, 196
one-bedroom units, and 74 two-bedroom units. Based on the proposed mix of apartment
units, the estimated peak parking demand rate for the apartments is 0.74 vehicles per unit. A
visitor parking demand rate of 0.05 vehicles per unit was assumed based on previously
approved transportation studies in the area.3 This results in a combined peak parking
demand of 237 vehicles when considering both resident and visitor peak parking demand.

Retail Component. The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the retail
is based on the ITE Parking Generation suburban rates for a shopping center (#820). The
vehicle mode split was assumed to be the same as used to estimate weekday PM peak hour
trip generation. The retail mode split was calculated to be 15 percent by vehicle.4 Based on
the proposed retail land use, a parking rate of 0.38 vehicles per 1,000 square-feet was used,
which results in a parking demand of 5 vehicles.5

Table 9 provides a summary of the estimated peak parking demand for the site. Note that
residential peak parking demands occur overnight while peak retail demand occur during
mid-day periods.

Note: du = dwelling units, ksf = 1,000 square feet


As shown in Table 9, the maximum on-site peak parking demand for the proposed project
would be 242 vehicles and would occur overnight. The peak parking demand for the retail
use is expected to be 5 vehicles and occur mid-day. The proposed supply of 265 parking
spaces would accommodate the estimated peak on-site peak parking demand.

previous traffic studies conducted in the vicinity as well as represents an approximate average of the daily and peak
hour mode splits.

 This assumes 15 percent of the trips to and from the retail component are vehicle based consistent with the trip
generation analysis.

Transit Impacts
An estimated 14 percent of residential trips and 5 percent of retail trips would be transit trips.
This results in a forecast of approximately 340 weekday transit trips with 24 during the AM
peak hour and 30 during the PM peak hour and would increase the demand for transit
services within the project vicinity. Detailed trip generation calculations are provided in
Appendix D. Increased transit usage is generally considered a positive impact to the transit
system by the City of Seattle.


Non-Motorized Impact
An estimated 39 percent of residential trips and 80 percent of retail trips are forecast to be
either pedestrian of bicycle trips. This results in a forecast of approximately 1,470 weekday
non-motorized trips with 78 during the AM peak hour and 117 during the PM peak hour and
would increase the demand for transit services within the project vicinity. Detailed non-
motorized trip generation calculations are provided in Appendix D. The ample existing transit
services and planned cycle track extension along 2nd Avenue past the project site would
serve the increased on-motorized traffic generated by the proposed project. In addition,
access to the on-site parking garage would occur from the adjacent alley and not directly to
adjacent public roadway. This helps to limit pedestrian interaction with project-generated
vehicles to the alley entrances where it is regularly expected.


Traffic Safety Impacts
As previously described, all study intersections and mid-block roadway locations fall below
the City of Seattle’s high accident location criteria. Traffic generated by the proposed
development would likely result in a proportionate increase in the probability of traffic
accidents; however, based on the minimal increase in overall traffic volumes and the impacts
to intersection operations it is unlikely that this increased probability would create a safety
hazard or significantly increase the number of reported accidents.

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the mixed use development
located at 210 Wall Street in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. General findings and
recommendations include:

          The proposed project would construct 300 residential apartment units and 12,000
           square feet of retail.
          The development is anticipated to generate 1,100 new vehicular weekday daily trips
           with 80 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 100 during the PM peak
           hour.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via the alley on Vine and
           Wall Streets.
          All of the off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better
           with the project with the exception of 3rd Avenue/ Vine Street which operates at
           LOS D under without-project and with-project conditions. All intersections would
           continue to operate better than City of Seattle criteria with the addition of project
           generated traffic.
          Both alley access locations are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better with
           minimal delay.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The proposed parking supply of 265 spaces would accommodate the anticipated
           peak parking demand with no forecast spillover.
          The project would provide 317 bicycle parking stalls which exceeds the required
           103 bicycle parking stalls.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
