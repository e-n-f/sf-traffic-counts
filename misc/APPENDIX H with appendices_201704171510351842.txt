Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic study for the proposed mixed-use office and residential
project at 405 E. 4th Avenue in San Mateo, California. The project proposes to demolish the existing
buildings on site and construct a four-story building with 55,291 s.f. of office space on three levels and
15 residential units on the fourth floor. The project proposes two levels of below grade parking providing
a total of 82 parking stalls. Access to the project site would be provided by one driveway located on S.
Claremont Street.

The purpose of the traffic study is to identify any potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project
and to review the proposed site access and circulation. It is estimated that the project would not add
more than 100 peak hour vehicle trips to any Congestion Management Program (CMP) roadways (El
Camino Real and US 101) designated by the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) of San
Mateo County. Therefore, an analysis in accordance with C/CAG’s CMP guidelines was not required.
The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set forth by the
City of San Mateo. The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions
during weekdays on the following study intersections in the vicinity of the project site.

Project Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate trip making to building size for
various land use types. For many types of land use there are standard trip generation rates that can be
applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new development. The
standard trip generation rates are published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual
entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition.

The ITE land use types that are applicable to the proposed project are General Office Building (ITE
Land Use Code 710) and Apartment (ITE Land Use Code 220). Since this project is located within the
San Mateo central business district and is within walking distance (1,500 feet) of the San Mateo
Caltrain station, Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates has estimated in the project’s TDM plan
document that the project would generate 14.6% fewer trips during the peak hours because of its
downtown location and proximity to transit. Based on the average ITE trip rates and the downtown
location/proximity to transit trip reduction, it is estimated that the proposed project would generate 81
vehicle trips (67 inbound and 14 outbound trips) during the AM peak hour and 78 vehicle trips (17
inbound and 61 outbound trips) during the PM peak hour.




                                                                                              Page | iii

The existing buildings on the site are currently generating traffic. Therefore, the traffic generated by the
project will not be entirely new trips. Hexagon counted the site driveways to determine the number of
trips currently being generated. The current trip generation is 11 vehicle trips (4 inbound and 7
outbound) during the AM peak hour and 9 vehicle trips (5 inbound and 4 outbound) during the PM peak
hour. After crediting the traffic generated by the existing land uses, the project is estimated to generate
net 70 vehicle trips (63 inbound and 7 outbound) during the AM peak hour and 69 vehicles trips (12
inbound and 57 outbound) during the PM peak hour.

Intersection levels of Service
The intersection LOS analysis concluded that all study intersections would operate at acceptable levels
of service (mid-LOS D or better) under all study scenarios. Therefore, the proposed project would have
an insignificant impact on intersection levels of service.

Intersection levels of service results are summarized in Table ES-1.

Operations Analysis
Operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts and are included for informational purposes only.
Queuing
Hexagon conducted a queuing analysis for the following lanes during the AM peak hour:

      Claremont Street and 3rd Avenue – westbound inner shared left-through lane
      Claremont Street and 4th Avenue – northbound shared left-through-right lane

The following movement is analyzed during the PM peak hour:

      Claremont Street and 4th Avenue – southbound shared left-through-right lane

Hexagon performed field observations at these intersections to determine the average queue length.
The reported existing queue lengths match our observations. The queuing analysis determined that the
95th percentile queues under background plus project conditions for all studied lanes are expected to be
contained within the existing storage and would not spill into upstream intersections.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
Pedestrian Facilities
The project would generate pedestrian traffic between the project site, downtown San Mateo, and the
San Mateo Caltrain station. Between these locations, pedestrian sidewalks and crosswalks are present
on every block forming a continuous pedestrian connection from the project site to the Caltrain station
and to downtown San Mateo. In addition, there are bulbouts at the corners of most downtown
intersections, and all intersections between San Mateo Drive and Delaware Street have a leading
pedestrian interval of three seconds. These measures provide safer pedestrian crossings at
intersections by lowering the pedestrian exposure time to vehicles and increasing pedestrian visibility to
drivers. The project would retain the existing pedestrian facilities fronting the project site. At the
northeast corner of Railroad Avenue and 4th Avenue, the project proposes a bulbout to provide safer
pedestrian crossings across Railroad Avenue, as well as enhanced open space for potential pedestrian
queuing while waiting for trains to pass.


                                                                                             Page | iv

Bicycle Facilities
The project could potentially generate bicycle traffic between the project site, downtown San Mateo and
the San Mateo Caltrain station. As discussed in Chapter 2 and shown on Figure 3, the north-south
bicycle connectivity within the project site is adequate while the east-west bicycle connectivity is
lacking. The City of San Mateo Bicycle Master Plan, adopted October 17, 2011 does not identify
planned bicycle improvements along 3rd and 4th Avenue within the project vicinity. Therefore, the bicycle
facilities will remain the same under project conditions.
On-Site Bicycle Facilities
Per City requirements, the project comprising 55,291 s.f. of office space and 15 studio/1-bedroom
residential units is required to provide three short-term and six long-term bicycle parking spaces for the
proposed office use and one short-term and 15 long-term bicycle parking spaces for the proposed
residential use. The project proposes two two-bike short-term bicycle racks at the southwest corner of
the project site. The project proposes a secured bicycle room on the upper level of the parking garage
with six bicycle spaces for office use. The project proposes a secured bicycle room on the lower level of
the parking garage with 15 bicycle spaces for residential use. Both secured bicycle rooms are directly
adjacent to an elevator that can be accessed from the ground floor. Overall, the project bicycle parking
provision meets the City’s requirement.

The project proposes two shower/changing rooms on the ground floor for office employees. These
shower/changing rooms would encourage employees to bike to work early and prepare for the day
without hygienic concerns.
Transit Access
As discussed in Chapter 2 and shown on Figure 4, the project site is served by four bus routes, and all
buses stop within walking distance of the project site. In addition, the San Mateo Caltrain station is
located approximately 1,500 feet north of the project site and is also within walking distance. There are
continuous pedestrian facilities connecting the project site to the various bus stops and the Caltrain
station. The project is anticipated to generate additional transit ridership on both the buses and Caltrain.
It is expected that the project-generated bus and train ridership would be relatively low and could be
accommodated within the existing bus and train capacities. In addition, Caltrain has plans to increase
the number of trains serving the San Mateo station from the existing 70 trains per day to 96 trains per
day during weekdays as part of the Caltrain electrification project.

Site Access and Circulation
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveway with regard to corner sight
distance and traffic volumes. The project proposes one driveway on Claremont Street approximately 85
feet north of the intersection with 4th Avenue. This driveway would provide access to two levels of
below-grade parking with 82 parking spaces. The driveway is proposed to be 22 feet wide, which meets
the City’s requirement.
Queuing at the Project Driveway
A queuing analysis was conducted at the project driveway to determine whether inbound and/or
outbound vehicle queues would considerably affect traffic operations on the surface streets and within
the parking garage. The analysis concludes that the northbound left-turn vehicles on Claremont Street
turning into the project driveway would create minimal queues on Claremont Street and would not
considerably affect traffic operations. Vehicles turning out of the project driveway would develop
minimal queues on-site and would not block a parked vehicle’s ability to maneuver out of an on-site
parking space.


                                                                                              Page | v

Driveway Sight Distance
The project access points should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight distance,
thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles traveling
on adjacent roadways. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a driver’s ability to locate a gap
in traffic and see oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists. Adequate corner sight distance (sight distance
triangles) should be provided at all site access points in accordance with the Town’s standards. Sight
distance triangles should be measured approximately 15 feet back from the traveled way.

Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on Claremont
Street is 25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 150 feet. The
adjacent property to the north currently has its driveway (approximately 24 feet wide) adjacent to the
proposed driveway. Therefore, a driver turning right out of the project driveway would have sufficient
sight distance looking north at southbound vehicles on Claremont Street. The project proposes an on-
street loading zone (25 feet long) directly south of the project driveway. When loading trucks are not
present, a driver turning left out of the project driveway would have sufficient sight distance looking
south at northbound vehicles on Claremont Street. However, when loading trucks are present, the
necessary sight distance for left-turning drivers would be blocked.
Recommendations
It is recommended that the on-street loading zone be moved away from the driveway to ensure that the
adequate sight distance would be maintained at all times.
On-Site Circulation
According to the site plan, the proposed parking garage contains two levels of below-grade parking. All
levels of the garage are connected by 24-foot wide two-way ramps. These ramps meet the minimum
standards set forth by the City of San Mateo Zoning Code (Chapter 27.64 Off-Street parking). Driving
aisles on all levels are at least 24 feet wide when there is parking on either side of the aisle and meet
the City’s requirement for minimum aisle widths.

On the lower level of the parking garage, eleven parking spaces are proposed to be gated for
residential and office uses. It is assumed that the gate will be closed at all times except when activated
by users. Therefore, the gate could be treated as a dead-end. Per City requirements, all dead-end
aisles are required to provide at least three feet of turn-around space at the end of the aisle. The site
plan currently shows a turn-around space of only two feet and six inches.
Recommendations
It is recommended that the site plan be revised to provide at least three feet of turn-around space in the
lower parking level prior to the parking gate.
Emergency Vehicles, Truck Access and Circulation
All driveway and drive aisles are at least 20 feet wide and comply with the City requirement for
emergency vehicle access.

The project proposes a trash room on the ground floor adjacent to the project driveway on the west side
of the electrical room and staircases. The trash room would have an opening onto the garage ramp
before the ramp depresses down to the lower levels. Trash bins would be picked up from and returned
to the dedicated trash enclosure on the day of garbage collection. Garbage trucks would not enter the
project driveway.




                                                                                            Page | vi

Per City requirements, the project is required to provide one loading area on-site. The project proposes
to provide the loading area on-street immediately south of the project driveway. As discussed above, it
is recommended that the loading area be moved away from the driveway to ensure adequate sight
distance for vehicles exiting the project.

Parking
Hexagon conducted a parking study for the proposed project (see Appendix G). Hexagon estimated
that on average office buildings within downtown San Mateo are generating an average peak parking
demand rate of 1.82 spaces per 1,000 s.f. Based on this demand rate, Hexagon estimates that the
proposed office would generate a peak parking demand of 101 parking spaces. The project proposes
74 parking spaces for the office land use. It is anticipated that the proposed on-site office parking
supply would not be sufficient to accommodate the peak office parking demand. The project would be
required to pay a parking in-lieu fee to the City of San Mateo. Within two blocks (approximately 600
feet) of the project site, there are two public parking garages and one public parking lot that could
provide secondary parking supply for the project. Alternatively, employees might park on-street along
nearby streets. Hexagon did not conduct parking counts at the nearby public parking garages and lots
or on-street to determine whether any vacant parking spaces currently exist.

Signal Warrant Analysis
The intersection of Claremont Street and 5th Avenue is currently under all-way stop control. The level of
service analysis at this intersection showed that it would operate at acceptable levels of service under
all conditions. Signal warrant analysis was performed based on the peak-hour turning-movement
volumes projected at this intersection. The analysis concluded that the projected peak-hour traffic
volumes would not warrant signalization at this intersection (see Appendix D).

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic study for the proposed mixed-use office and residential
project at 405 E. 4th Avenue in San Mateo, California (see Figure 1). The project proposes to demolish
the existing buildings on site and construct a four-story building with 55,291 s.f. of office space on three
levels and 15 residential units on the fourth floor (see Figure 2). The project proposes two levels of
below grade parking providing a total of 82 parking stalls. Access to the project site would be provided
by one driveway located on S. Claremont Street.

Scope of Study
The purpose of the traffic study is to identify any potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project
and to review the proposed site access and circulation. It is estimated that the project would not add
more than 100 peak hour vehicle trips to any Congestion Management Program (CMP) roadways (El
Camino Real and US 101) designated by the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) of San
Mateo County. Therefore, an analysis in accordance with C/CAG’s CMP guidelines was not required.
The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set forth by the
City of San Mateo. The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions
during weekdays on the following study intersections in the vicinity of the project site.

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of
adjacent street traffic. The AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00
AM, and the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during
these periods on an average weekday that the most congested traffic conditions occur.

Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:

   Scenario 1: Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were based on new traffic counts
               conducted in the year 2016, while schools were in session.
   Scenario 2: Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
               existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet
               completed developments.
   Scenario 3: Background plus Project Conditions. Background plus project traffic volumes were
               estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the traffic generated by the
               proposed project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
               background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.
   Scenario 4: Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project traffic volumes were estimated
               by adding to existing traffic volumes the traffic generated by the proposed project.
               Existing plus Project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in order
               to determine the effects the project would have on the existing roadway network.
   Scenario 5: 2030 Cumulative Conditions. 2030 Cumulative conditions represent future traffic
               volumes on the future transportation network in accordance with the San Mateo
               General Plan. The 2030 level of service results from the San Mateo General Plan,
               which includes the proposed project, were used to describe operating conditions at the
               study intersections under cumulative conditions. For study intersections not included in
               the General Plan report, the traffic volumes were interpolated based on nearby
               intersections analyzed in the General Plan.

Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.
Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from field observations, new traffic counts, previous
traffic studies, the City of San Mateo, and the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation manual, 9th Edition. The following data were collected from these sources:
      Existing traffic volumes,
      Existing lane geometries,
      Signal timing and phasing,
      Approved project list, and
      Applicable trip generation rates

Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of
Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions
with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis
methods are described below.
City of San Mateo Intersections
This study utilizes the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology for signalized intersections,
implemented with Synchro. This method evaluates intersection operations on the basis of average
control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. This average delay can then be correlated to a
level of service. Table 1 presents the level of service definitions for signalized intersections. The City of
San Mateo level of service standard is mid-LOS D (delay of 45 seconds) or better for all of the
signalized study intersections.

                                                                                                     (sec.)

           Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the green
   A       phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to the very     10.0 or less
           low vehicle delay.

           Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle lengths.
   B       More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average vehicle           10.1 to 20.0
           delay.

           Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
           lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
   C                                                                                              20.1 to 35.0
           of vehicles stopping is significant, though many still pass through the
           intersection without stopping.
           The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
           result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
   D                                                                                              35.1 to 55.0
           lengths, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
           individual cycle failures are noticeable.

           This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
   E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-       55.1 to 80.0
           to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

           This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
           often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
   F                                                                                           greater than 80.0
           capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also
           be major-contributing causes of such delay levels.

Unsignalized Intersections
For the one unsignalized study intersection, an assessment was made of the need for signalization.
This assessment was made on the basis of the Peak-hour Volume Signal Warrant described in the
California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). This method makes no evaluation of
intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication whether peak-hour traffic volumes are, or
would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal. The signal warrant check was supplemented
with an analysis of level of service. The correlation between delay and level of service for unsignalized
intersections is shown in Table 2. The City of San Mateo does not have a level of service standard for
unsignalized intersections. Traffic studies typically evaluate whether unsignalized intersections are
functioning adequately and whether signalization is warranted.

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the project site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
Also included are the existing levels of service of the study intersections.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project study area is provided by US 101 and SR 92. These facilities are
described below.

US 101 is an eight-lane north-south freeway in the vicinity of the site. US 101 extends northward
through San Francisco and southward through San Jose. Access to and from the project study area is
provided via its interchange at Third/ Fourth Avenue.

SR 92 is a four- to six- lane east-west freeway extending from Half Moon Bay in west San Mateo
County to Hayward in Alameda County. SR 92 has full interchanges at El Camino Real and at Concar
Drive/Delaware Street, which serves the study area.

Local access to the project site is provided via El Camino Real, San Mateo Drive, B Street, Claremont
Street, Delaware Street, Humboldt Street, Third Avenue, Fourth Avenue and Fifth Avenue. These
roadways are described below.

El Camino Real (SR 82) is a six-lane north-south major arterial within the project vicinity. El Camino
Real extends from Santa Clara County through San Mateo County. Sidewalks are present on both
sides of the road. All intersections along El Camino Real within the project vicinity have crosswalks on
all legs with actuated pedestrian push buttons and signal heads. El Camino Real provides access to the
project site via its intersections with Third Avenue and Fourth Avenue.

San Mateo Drive is a two-lane north-south arterial street within the project vicinity. San Mateo Drive
extends from 5th Avenue in the south to Peninsula Avenue in the north, where it transitions into
California Drive and ends at Millbrae Avenue in Millbrae. On-street parking is allowed along both sides
of the roadway. There are sidewalks along both sides of San Mateo Drive. All intersections along San
Mateo Drive within the project vicinity have crosswalks on all legs with actuated pedestrian push
buttons and signal heads. There is a two-to-three second leading pedestrian interval (LPI) at the
beginning of each vehicular phase. A LPI allows pedestrians on the appropriate crosswalks to walk into
the crosswalks while all vehicular movements are prohibited. San Mateo Drive provides access to the

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Within the vicinity of the project site, a Class I bicycle path exists on 3rd Avenue/4th Avenue from
Humboldt Street to Norfolk Avenue (see Figure 3). Class II bicycle lanes exist on Laurel Avenue from
5th Avenue to 9th Avenue, Delaware Street south of 5th Avenue, Claremont Street south of 9th
Avenue, 9th Avenue east of B Street, Palm Avenue south of 9th Avenue, and 3rd Avenue west of
Dartmouth Road. Class III bicycle routes exist on Delaware Street north of 5th Avenue, on Claremont
Street north of 9th Avenue, on B Street between 9th Avenue and Baldwin Avenue, on San Mateo Drive
between 5th Avenue and Poplar Avenue, and on 5th Avenue between San Mateo Drive and Delaware
Street. Overall, the north-south bicycle connectivity is adequate within the project vicinity. East-west
bicycle connectivity within the project vicinity is lacking.

Pedestrian facilities near the project site consist of sidewalks along both sides of all roadways, as well
as crosswalks at all signalized intersections. Signalized intersections in downtown San Mateo between
San Mateo Drive and Delaware Street all have a pedestrian leading interval (as discussed above).
Within the immediate vicinity of the project site, the intersections along Claremont Drive at 3rd Avenue
and at 4th Avenue both have bulbouts that reduce the crosswalk lengths and pedestrian exposure to
traffic. There are no crosswalks at the unsignalized intersection of Claremont Drive and 5th Avenue.

Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the San Mateo County Transit District
(SamTrans) and Caltrain. These services are described below and shown on Figure 4.
SamTrans Bus Service
The 53 line operates on Delaware Street within the project area, providing service between
Humboldt/Peninsula, Borel Square Shopping Center, and Borel Middle School. The line operates only
on weekdays, with two buses in the westbound direction during the AM peak period. The closest bus
stop to the project site is at Delaware Street and 3rd Avenue, approximately 500 feet from the project
site.

The 59 line operates on 2nd Avenue and 4th Avenue within the project area, providing service between
Norfolk/Hillsdale, San Mateo Caltrain Station and Aragon High School. The line operates only on

Caltrain Service
Commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy is provided by Caltrain. The project site is
located about 1,500 feet south of the San Mateo Caltrain station, which is about a 10-minute walk.
Caltrain provides service with approximately 20- to 30-minute headways during the weekday AM and
PM commute hours and 60 minute headways midday, at nights and on weekends. Sidewalks exist on
most of the routes between the project site and the Caltrain station. Bus lines 59, 292, and 295 also
provide connection between the project site and the Caltrain station.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations and Traffic Volumes
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained from field observations (see
Figure 5).

Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new manual peak-hour turning-movement counts
conducted in September 2016 (see Figure 6), while schools were in session. The traffic count data
(including pedestrian and bicycle count data) are included in Appendix A.




                                                                                         Page | 20

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level-of-service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in
Table 3. The results show that all study intersections are operating at an acceptable LOS C or better.

The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersection is provided for informational purposes
only, as the City does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. The
unsignalized study intersection currently operates at LOS B. The level of service for the four-way stop-
controlled intersection is the level of service based on the average delay for all the intersection
approaches.

The intersection levels of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to
confirm the accuracy of calculated intersection levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to
identify any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to
identify any locations where the level of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing traffic
conditions.
Humboldt Street and 3rd Avenue
During the PM peak hour, the southbound through movement often received the green ball for only ten
to fifteen seconds. As a result, most vehicles going southbound through the intersection required two
signal cycles to clear the intersection. Vehicles on all other movements at the intersection cleared
within one signal cycle.
Humboldt Street and 4th Avenue
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound through movement received heavy volumes and often queued
to Eldorado Street. This queue occurs because most vehicles stayed in the northern two lanes to either
turn onto US 101 northbound or go over the overpass to Norfolk Street. Moreover, approximately ten
seconds into each eastbound through movement phase, congestion created by the on-ramp and off-
ramp merging on the overpass caused the eastbound through movement queues to back into the
intersection. As a result, not all vehicles were able to clear within one signal cycle. Vehicles on all other
movements at the intersection cleared within one signal cycle.
Delaware Street at 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue
During the AM peak hour, the southbound left-turn movement from Delaware Street onto eastbound 4th
Avenue received heavy volumes and often queued to 3rd Avenue, requiring two signal cycles to clear.
As a result, the inner southbound through lane on Delaware Street between 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue
is often blocked by the southbound left-turn queue spillback at Delaware Street and 4th Avenue. This
further caused the southbound through movement and the westbound left-turn movement at the
intersection of Delaware Street and 3rd Avenue to develop lengthy queues that also required two signal
cycles to clear. However, the observed congestion at this intersection lasted only approximately fifteen
minutes during the peak hour.
4th Avenue at Claremont Street and Delaware Street
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound through movement on 4th Avenue at Delaware Street
occasionally developed lengthy queues that spilled into the upstream intersection at Claremont Street.
As a result, eastbound through movement vehicles on 4th Avenue occasionally required two signal
cycles to clear the intersection at Claremont Street.




                                                                                             Page | 25

El Camino Real at 3rd Avenue, 4th Avenue, and 5th Avenue
During the AM peak hour, minor congestion was observed in the northbound direction on El Camino
Real at the beginning of the northbound green phase. However, all vehicles were able to clear within
one signal cycle.

During the PM peak hour, minor congestion was observed in the southbound direction on El Camino
Real at the beginning of the southbound green phase. All southbound vehicles were able to clear within
one signal cycle. At the intersection of El Camino Real and 5th Avenue, vehicles turning left from 5th
Avenue to southbound El Camino Real occasionally required two cycles to clear when there was
considerable traffic in the eastbound through movement.

Hexagon observed minor to no operational issues at the other study intersections not discussed above.
Overall, Hexagon confirmed that the calculated existing intersection levels of service match the existing
field observations.

Accident Analysis
Accident data for study intersections were provided by the City of San Mateo. The records include the
time period beginning January 1, 2000 and ending November 21, 2016. The accident data record is
included in Appendix E and summarized in Table 4. As shown on Table 4, the actual accident rates at
14 of the study intersections are higher than the California state-wide average accident rates at similar
intersections.

Notes:
1. ADT (Average Daily Traffic) is estimated using peak hour intersection volumes.
2. Average accident rates are based on California average rates for multi-legged signalized and 4-way stop intersections in urban areas as
indicated in 2013 Collision data on California State Highways.
Bold and boxed indicates that the intersection accident
rate is higher than the state average.

Background Conditions
This chapter describes background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions with the addition
of traffic from approved but not constructed projects in the area. Traffic volumes for background
conditions comprise volumes from the existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by approved projects
in the vicinity of the site. This chapter describes the procedure used to determine approved traffic
volumes and the resulting traffic conditions.

Background Transportation Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions, including
roadways and intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under existing
conditions at all study intersections.

Background Traffic Volumes
Background traffic volumes were estimated for the project completion year by adding traffic from
approved but not yet completed developments in the project area. The approved and under-
construction developments included in this study are listed below.

   1.   Central Park South: develop a 33,500 s.f. office building and a 60-unit apartment building
   2.   2 E. 3rd Avenue: develop a 20,000 s.f. office building with 3,900 s.f. of retail space
   3.   221 El Camino Real: develop a 21,100 s.f. office building with 11,400 s.f. of retail space
   4.   Classics at San Mateo: develop a 27-unit apartment building
   5.   Mi Rancho Market: develop a 12,200 s.f. market
   6.   210 S. Fremont Street: develop a 15-unit condominium building
   7.   737 2nd Avenue: develop a 7-unit multi-family residential building




                                                                                          Page | 27

The following approved but not yet completed developments have also been considered, but are not
expected to add traffic to any of the study intersections during either the AM or PM peak hours:

   8. Bay Meadows Phase II
   9. 400 & 450 Concar Drive Office Buildings
   10. 220 Bayshore Townhomes
   11. 341 Delaware Street Cal Water
   12. 2123 & 2133 De Anza Duplex
   13. 1990 El Camino Real Espresso Lane Drive-Thru
   14. Bosworth Residence
   15. Gum Street Residential
   16. Hillsdale Shopping Center
   17. 400 Mariners Island Boulevard Condominiums
   18. San Mateo Executive Office Park

Trip generation, distribution and assignment estimates for all background projects were obtained from
the respective project Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) reports.

Background traffic volumes were obtained by combining existing traffic volumes with the additional trips
generated from the approved projects. The AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes under background
conditions are shown on Figure 7.

Intersection Levels of Service under Background Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized in
Table 5. The results show that all intersections would continue to operate at LOS C or better.
The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersections is provided for informational purposes
only, as the City does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. The
unsignalized study intersections would continue to operate under background conditions at LOS B.

Project Conditions
This chapter describes the roadway traffic operations under background plus project conditions and
existing plus project conditions, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts
caused by the project. Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were
to be occupied prior to the other approved projects in the area. However, it is unlikely that this traffic
condition would occur, since some of the other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study
area would likely be built and occupied during the time this project is going through the development
review process.

Significant Impact Criteria
The traffic impacts of the project are evaluated against the following criteria to determine whether the
impacts are significant.
City of San Mateo Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
Per the City’s General Plan Policy C 2.7, all projects are required, at a minimum, to pay a transportation
mitigation fee. The transportation mitigation fee is used to fund planned transportation improvements
that are identified in the City of San Mateo Traffic Mitigation Program.

In addition to paying the transportation impact fee, a development project may be required to fund off-
site circulation improvements which are needed as a result of project generated traffic if:

      The level of service at the intersection drops below mid-level LOS D (average delay of more
       than 45 seconds) when the project traffic is added, and

      An intersection that operates below its level of service standard under the base year conditions
       experiences an increase in delay of four or more seconds, and

      The needed improvement of the intersection(s) is not funded in the applicable five-year City
       Capital Improvement Program from the date of application approval.

The cost of the off-site improvements may be reimbursed by the City if a reimbursement program is
established throughout the timeframe of the City of San Mateo’s current Traffic Mitigation Program or at
the time when the improvement was initially scheduled.




                                                                                             Page | 32

Unsignalized Intersections
The City of San Mateo does not have a level of service standard for unsignalized intersections. Traffic
studies typically evaluate whether unsignalized intersections are functioning adequately and whether
signalization is warranted using the peak-hour volume signal warrant described in the CA MUTCD.

Project Description
The project proposes to demolish the existing buildings on site and construct a four-story building with
55,291 s.f. of office space on the ground to third floor and 15 residential units on the fourth floor. The
project proposes two levels of below grade parking providing a total of 82 parking stalls. Access to the
project site would be provided by one driveway located on S. Claremont Street.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site
is estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made
of the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the
project trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures are described below.
Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate trip making to building size for
various land use types. For many types of land use there are standard trip generation rates that can be
applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new development. The
standard trip generation rates are published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual
entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition.

The ITE land use types that are applicable to the proposed project are General Office Building (ITE
Land Use Code 710) and Apartment (ITE Land Use Code 220). Since this project is located within the
San Mateo central business district and is within walking distance (1,500 feet) of the San Mateo
Caltrain station, Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates has estimated in the project’s TDM plan
document that the project would generate 14.6% fewer trips during the peak hours because of its
downtown location and proximity to transit. Based on the average ITE trip rates and the downtown
location/proximity to transit trip reduction, it is estimated that the proposed project would generate 81
vehicle trips (67 inbound and 14 outbound trips) during the AM peak hour and 78 vehicle trips (17
inbound and 61 outbound trips) during the PM peak hour.

The existing buildings on the site are currently generating traffic. Therefore, the traffic generated by the
project will not be entirely new trips. Hexagon counted the site driveways to determine the number of
trips currently being generated. The current trip generation is 11 vehicle trips (4 inbound and 7
outbound) during the AM peak hour and 9 vehicle trips (5 inbound and 4 outbound) during the PM peak
hour. After crediting the traffic generated by the existing land uses, the project is estimated to generate
net 70 vehicle trips (63 inbound and 7 outbound) during the AM peak hour and 69 vehicles trips (12
inbound and 57 outbound) during the PM peak hour.

The trip generation estimates for the proposed project are shown in Table 6.

Notes:
All rates are from: Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation, 9th Edition
1. Land Use Code 710: General Office Building (averag rates, expressed in trips per 1,000 s.f.)
2. Land Use Code 220: Apartments (average rates, expressed in trips per dwelling unit)
3. Given the project's location in downtown San Mateo and its proximity to transit, Nelson\Nygaard has
estimated that these factors would reduce project trip generation by 14.6% during the peak hour.
4. Existing site driveway counts are based on driveway counts conducted in September 2016 on a regular
weekday during both the AM (7-9 AM) and PM (4-6 PM) peak hours of commute traffic.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
Trips generated by the existing land use as well as by the proposed office and residential land uses
were distributed to the study network based on the existing travel patterns on the surrounding roadway
system and the locations of complementary land uses. Within downtown San Mateo, it is estimated that
the trip distributions for office and residential land uses would be similar (see Figure 8). The existing
land use generates little traffic and is assumed to follow the same trip distribution as shown on Figure 8.

The project trips were assigned to the roadway network based on the directions of approach and
departure, the roadway network connections, and the location of the project driveway. It should be
noted that 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue east of Delaware Street are one-way streets extending
from/towards the US 101 interchange. Therefore, trips originating from US 101 and the area east of US
101 will all be assigned to 3rd Avenue, while trips going to US 101 and the area east of US 101 will all
be assigned to 4th Avenue. The net project trips at each study intersection under project conditions is
shown on Figure 9.

Intersection Traffic Volumes
Project impacts were evaluated relative to both (1) background traffic volumes and (2) existing traffic
volumes. For the background plus project scenario, the net new trips generated by the project were
added to the background traffic volumes (described in Chapter 3) to derive the background plus project
traffic volumes. Figure 10 shows the intersection turning-movement volumes under background plus
project conditions. For the existing plus project scenario, the net new trips generated by the project
were added to the existing traffic volumes (described in Chapter 2) to derive the existing plus project
traffic volumes. Figure 11 shows the intersection turning-movement volumes under existing plus project
conditions.

Transportation Network
This analysis assumes that the transportation network under project conditions would be the same as
under existing and background conditions.

Project Conditions Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis for the (1) background plus project and (2)
existing plus project scenarios are summarized in Tables 7 and 8.

The results of the level of service calculations show that under background plus project conditions and
under existing plus project conditions, all of the study intersections would continue to operate at
acceptable levels of service.

Transportation Demand Management Measures
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) is a combination of services, incentives, facilities, and
actions that reduce single-occupant vehicle (SOV) trips to help relieve traffic congestion, parking
demand, and air pollution. The purpose of TDM is to promote more efficient utilization of existing
transportation facilities, and to ensure that new developments are designed to maximize the potential
for sustainable transportation usage.

The City of San Mateo has established a 25% trip reduction target for TDM programs within downtown
San Mateo as part of City of San Mateo’s Sustainable Streets Plan. The project has prepared a TDM
plan to reduce project generated vehicular trips. The TDM plan is presented in Appendix F.

Vehicle Miles Traveled
In accordance with SB 743, daily VMT for projects in San Mateo versus the average of the San
Francisco Bay area are presented based on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) travel
demand forecast model (http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/Main/VmtPerWorker, and
http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/Main/VmtPerCapita, accessed on October 6, 2016). The Year 2010
Plan Bay Area model forecasted daily VMT is 26.4 miles per worker employed and 12.6 miles per
resident in this area of San Mateo (Traffic Analysis Zone 257), while the San Francisco Bay Area
average daily VMT is 23.8 miles per worker and 15.5 miles per resident. Given that no standard
approach or guidelines have been finalized under SB 743, the VMT presented in this report is for
informational purposes only. It is not intended to provide any indication of the transportation impacts of
the project under SB 743.

The TDM measures proposed by the project would encourage alternative and active commuting
behavior that would reduce single-occupant vehicle trips. These TDM measures would reduce the VMT
generated by the proposed project.

Cumulative Conditions
Cumulative 2030 traffic conditions were evaluated for the AM and PM peak hours. The 2030 AM and
PM peak hour traffic volumes at eleven signalized study intersections were obtained from the City of
San Mateo General Plan 2030 model. The Year 2030 San Mateo Travel Demand Forecast Model did
not produce volumes for the three study intersections along Claremont Avenue or for the intersection at
El Camino Real and 5th Avenue. Year 2030 traffic volumes at these intersections were interpolated
based on forecasted volumes at nearby intersections. Hexagon has determined that the proposed
project is included in the Year 2030 forecasts.

Intersection Levels of Service Under 2030 Cumulative Conditions
The intersection levels of service under 2030 Cumulative Conditions are summarized in Table 9. The
results of the level of service calculations show that all of the study intersections would continue to
operate at acceptable levels of service under cumulative conditions. Since the proposed project is
included in the existing 2030 forecasts, and all intersections are forecasted to operate at acceptable
levels of service, the proposed project would have an insignificant impact on intersection levels of
service.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project site,
including:

        Operations analysis – vehicle queuing and storage at selected intersections,
        Potential impacts to transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
        Site access, on-site circulation,
        Parking, and
        Signal warrant analysis.

Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is specified in the San Mateo General Plan, the
analyses in this chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and
methods employed by the traffic engineering community.

Although operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts, they do describe traffic conditions that
are relevant to describing the project environment.

Queuing Analysis
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability
of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

         P (x n)    n e – ()
                          n!
Where:
         P (x n)  probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
n  number of vehicles in the queue per lane

Average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles per
hour)




                                                                                          Page | 45
405 E. 4th Avenue Draft Transportation Impact Analysis                                January 24, 2017

The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand left-turn movements at
intersections where 10 or more project trips were added or there was observed congestion. Using a
Poisson probability distribution, the basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability
distribution is used to estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles for a particular
movement; (2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue
length, assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the
existing or planned available storage capacity for the movement to determine if adequate storage is
available to accommodate the 95th percentile queues. This analysis thus provides a basis for
determining whether the addition of project trips would exacerbate peak hour queues and delays, as
well as estimating future storage requirements at intersections.

The following lanes were analyzed during the AM peak hour:

      Claremont Street and 3rd Avenue – westbound inner shared left-through lane
      Claremont Street and 4th Avenue – northbound shared left-through-right lane

The following movement is analyzed during the PM peak hour:
    Claremont Street and 4th Avenue – southbound shared left-through-right lane

Hexagon performed field observations at these intersections to determine the average queue length.
The reported existing queue lengths match our observations. As shown on Table 10, the 95th percentile
queues under background plus project conditions for all studied lanes are expected to be contained
within the existing storage and would not spill into upstream intersections.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
Pedestrian Facilities
The project would generate pedestrian traffic between the project site, downtown San Mateo, and the
San Mateo Caltrain station. Between these locations, pedestrian sidewalks and crosswalks are present
on every block forming a continuous pedestrian connection from the project site to the Caltrain station
and to downtown San Mateo. In addition, there are bulbouts at corners of most of downtown
intersections, and all intersections between San Mateo Drive and Delaware Street have a leading
pedestrian interval of three seconds. These measures provide safer pedestrian crossings at
intersections by lowering the pedestrian exposure time to vehicles and increasing pedestrian visibility to
drivers. The project would retain the existing pedestrian facilities fronting the project site. At the
northeast corner of Railroad Avenue and 4th Avenue, the project proposes a bulbout to provide safer
pedestrian crossings across Railroad Avenue as well as enhanced open space for potential pedestrian
queuing while waiting for trains to pass.

Bicycle Facilities
The project could potentially generate bicycle traffic between the project site, downtown San Mateo and
the San Mateo Caltrain station. As discussed in Chapter 2 and shown on Figure 3, the north-south
bicycle connectivity within the project site is adequate while the east-west bicycle connectivity is
lacking. The City of San Mateo Bicycle Master Plan, adopted October 17, 2011 does not identify
planned bicycle improvements along 3rd and 4th Avenue within the project vicinity. Therefore, the bicycle
facilities will remain the same under project conditions.
On-Site Bicycle Facilities
Per City requirements, the project comprising 55,291 s.f. of office space and 15 studio/1-bedroom
residential units is required to provide three short-term and six long-term bicycle parking spaces for the
proposed office use and one short-term and 15 long-term bicycle parking spaces for the proposed
residential use. The project proposes two two-bike short-term bicycle racks at the southwest corner of
the project site. The project proposes a secured bicycle room on the upper level of the parking garage
with six bicycle spaces for office use. The project proposes a secured bicycle room on the lower level of
the parking garage with 15 bicycle spaces for residential use. Both secured bicycle rooms are directly
adjacent to an elevator that can be accessed from the ground floor. Overall, the project bicycle parking
provision meets the City’s requirement.

The project proposes two shower/changing rooms on the ground floor for office employees. These
shower/changing rooms would encourage employees to bike to work early and prepare for the day
without hygienic concerns.
Transit Access
As discussed in Chapter 2 and shown on Figure 4, the project site is served by four bus routes, and all
buses stop within walking distance of the project site. In addition, the San Mateo Caltrain station is
located approximately 1,500 feet north of the project site and is also within walking distance. There are
continuous pedestrian facilities connecting the project site to the various bus stops and the Caltrain
station. The project is anticipated to generate additional transit ridership on both the buses and Caltrain.
It is expected that the project-generated bus and train ridership would be relatively low and could be
accommodated within the existing bus and train capacities. In addition, Caltrain has plans to increase
the number of trains serving the San Mateo station from the existing 70 trains per day to 96 trains per
day during weekdays as part of the Caltrain electrification project.

Site Access and Circulation
This section describes the site access and circulation of the proposed project. This review is based on
the project site plan prepared by Arc Tec, Inc., dated July 29, 2016, shown on Figure 2.
Site Access
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveway with regard to corner sight
distance and traffic volumes. The project proposes one driveway on Claremont Street approximately 85
feet north of the intersection with 4th Avenue. This driveway would provide access to two levels of
below-grade parking with 82 parking spaces. The driveway is proposed to be 22 feet wide, which meets
the City’s requirement.

Queuing at the Project Driveway
A queuing analysis was conducted at the project driveway to determine whether inbound and/or
outbound vehicle queues would considerably affect traffic operations on the surface streets and within
the parking garage. As shown in Table 11, the northbound left-turn vehicles on Claremont Street
turning into the project driveway would create minimal queues on Claremont Street and would not
considerably affect traffic operations. Vehicles turning out of the project driveway would develop
minimal queues on-site and would not block a parked vehicle’s ability to maneuver out of an on-site
parking space.

Driveway Sight Distance
The project access points should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight distance,
thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles traveling
on adjacent roadways. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a driver’s ability to locate a gap
in traffic and see oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists. Adequate corner sight distance (sight distance
triangles) should be provided at all site access points in accordance with the Town’s standards. Sight
distance triangles should be measured approximately 15 feet back from the traveled way.

Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on Claremont
Street is 25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 150 feet. The
adjacent property to the north currently has its driveway (approximately 24 feet wide) adjacent to the
proposed driveway. Therefore, a driver turning right out of the project driveway would have sufficient
sight distance looking north at southbound vehicles on Claremont Street. The project proposes an on-
street loading zone (25 feet long) directly south of the project driveway. When loading trucks are not
present, a driver turning left out of the project driveway would have sufficient sight distance looking
south at northbound vehicles on Claremont Street. However, when loading trucks are present, the
necessary sight distance for left-turning drivers would be blocked.




                                                                                         Page | 49
405 E. 4th Avenue Draft Transportation Impact Analysis                                   January 24, 2017

Recommendations
It is recommended that the on-street loading zone be moved away from the driveway to ensure that the
adequate sight distance would be maintained at all times.
On-Site Circulation
According to the site plan, the proposed parking garage contains two levels of below-grade parking. All
levels of the garage are connected by 24-foot wide two-way ramps. These ramps meet the minimum
standards set forth by the City of San Mateo Zoning Code (Chapter 27.64 Off-Street parking). Driving
aisles on all levels are at least 24 feet wide when there is parking on either side of the aisle and meet
the City’s requirement for minimum aisle widths.

On the lower level of the parking garage, eleven parking spaces are proposed to be gated for
residential and office uses. It is assumed that the gate will be closed at all times except when activated
by users. Therefore, the gate could be treated as a dead-end. Per City requirements, all dead-end
aisles are required to provide at least three feet of turn-around space at the end of the aisle. The site
plan currently shows a turn-around space of only two feet and six inches.
Recommendations
It is recommended that the site plan be revised to provide at least three feet of turn-around space in the
lower parking level prior to the parking gate.
Emergency Vehicles, Truck Access and Circulation
All driveway and drive aisles are at least 20 feet wide and comply with the City requirement for
emergency vehicle access.

The project proposes a trash room on the ground floor adjacent to the project driveway on the west side
of the electrical room and staircases. The trash room would have an opening onto the garage ramp
before the ramp depresses down to the lower levels. Trash bins would be picked up from and returned
to the dedicated trash enclosure on the day of garbage collection. Garbage trucks would not enter the
project driveway.

Per City requirements, the project is required to provide one loading area on-site. The project proposes
to provide the loading area on-street immediately south of the project driveway. As discussed above, it
is recommended that the loading area be moved away from the driveway to ensure adequate sight
distance for vehicles exiting the project.

Parking
Hexagon conducted a parking study for the proposed project (see Appendix G). Hexagon estimated
that office buildings within downtown San Mateo are generating an average peak parking demand rate
of 1.82 spaces per 1,000 s.f. Based on this demand rate, Hexagon estimates that the proposed office
would generate a peak parking demand of 101 parking spaces. The project proposes 74 parking
spaces for the office land use. It is anticipated that the proposed on-site office parking supply would not
be sufficient to accommodate the peak office parking demand. The project would be required to pay a
parking in-lieu fee to the City of San Mateo. Within two blocks (approximately 600 feet) of the project
site, there are two public parking garages and one public parking lot that could provide secondary
parking supply for the project. Alternatively, employees might park on-street along nearby streets.
Hexagon did not conduct parking counts at the nearby public parking garages and lots or on-street to
determine whether any vacant parking spaces currently exist.

Signal Warrant Analysis
The intersection of Claremont Street and 5th Avenue is currently under all-way stop control. The level of
service analysis at this intersection showed that it would operate at acceptable levels of service under
all conditions. Signal warrant analysis was performed based on the peak-hour turning-movement
volumes projected at this intersection. The analysis concluded that the projected peak-hour traffic
volumes would not warrant signalization at this intersection (see Appendix D).

Conclusions
This report presents the results of the traffic study for the proposed mixed-use office and residential
project at 405 E. 4th Avenue in San Mateo, California. The project proposes to demolish the existing
buildings on site and construct a four-story building with 55,291 s.f. of office space on the ground to
third floor and 15 residential units on the fourth floor. The project proposes two levels of below grade
parking providing a total of 82 parking stalls. Access to the project site would be provided by one
driveway located on S. Claremont Street.

The purpose of the traffic study is to identify any potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project
and to review the proposed site access and circulation. It is estimated that the project would not add
more than 100 peak hour vehicle trips to any Congestion Management Program (CMP) roadways (El
Camino Real and US 101) designated by the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) of San
Mateo County. Therefore, an analysis in accordance with C/CAG’s CMP guidelines was not required.
The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set forth by the
City of San Mateo. The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions
during weekdays on the following study intersections in the vicinity of the project site.

Intersection levels of Service
The intersection LOS analysis concluded that all study intersections would operate at acceptable levels
of service (mid-LOS D or better) under all study scenarios. Therefore, the proposed project would have
an insignificant impact on intersection levels of service.

Operations Analysis
Operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts and are included for informational purposes only.
Queuing
Hexagon conducted a queuing analysis for the following lanes during the AM peak hour:

      Claremont Street and 3rd Avenue – westbound inner shared left-through lane
      Claremont Street and 4th Avenue – northbound shared left-through-right lane

The following movement is analyzed during the PM peak hour:

      Claremont Street and 4th Avenue – southbound shared left-through-right lane


                                                                                             Page | 52

Hexagon performed field observations at these intersections to determine the average queue length.
The reported existing queue lengths match our observations. The queuing analysis determined that the
95th percentile queues under background plus project conditions for all studied lanes are expected to be
contained within the existing storage and would not spill into upstream intersections.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
Pedestrian Facilities
The project would generate pedestrian traffic between the project site, downtown San Mateo, and the
San Mateo Caltrain station. Between these locations, pedestrian sidewalks and crosswalks are present
on every block forming a continuous pedestrian connection from the project site to the Caltrain station
and to downtown San Mateo. In addition, there are bulbouts at corners of most of downtown
intersections, and all intersections between San Mateo Drive and Delaware Street have a leading
pedestrian interval of three seconds. These measures provide safer pedestrian crossings at
intersections by lowering the pedestrian exposure time to vehicles and increasing pedestrian visibility to
drivers. The project would retain the existing pedestrian facilities fronting the project site. At the
northeast corner of Railroad Avenue and 4th Avenue, the project proposes a bulbout to provide safer
pedestrian crossings across Railroad Avenue as well as enhanced open space for potential pedestrian
queuing while waiting for trains to pass.
Bicycle Facilities
The project could potentially generate bicycle traffic between the project site, downtown San Mateo and
the San Mateo Caltrain station. As discussed in Chapter 2 and shown on Figure 3, the north-south
bicycle connectivity within the project site is adequate while the east-west bicycle connectivity is
lacking. The City of San Mateo Bicycle Master Plan, adopted October 17, 2011 does not identify
planned bicycle improvements along 3rd and 4th Avenue within the project vicinity. Therefore, the bicycle
facilities will remain the same under project conditions.
On-Site Bicycle Facilities
Per City requirements, the project comprising 55,291 s.f. of office space and 15 studio/1-bedroom
residential units is required to provide three short-term and six long-term bicycle parking spaces for the
proposed office use and one short-term and 15 long-term bicycle parking spaces for the proposed
residential use. The project proposes two two-bike short-term bicycle racks at the southwest corner of
the project site. The project proposes a secured bicycle room on the upper level of the parking garage
with six bicycle spaces for office use. The project proposes a secured bicycle room on the lower level of
the parking garage with 15 bicycle spaces for residential use. Both secured bicycle rooms are directly
adjacent to an elevator that can be accessed from the ground floor. Overall, the project bicycle parking
provision meets the City’s requirement.

The project proposes two shower/changing rooms on the ground floor for office employees. These
shower/changing rooms would encourage employees to bike to work early and prepare for the day
without hygienic concerns.

Transit Access
As discussed in Chapter 2 and shown on Figure 4, the project site is served by four bus routes, and all
buses stop within walking distance of the project site. In addition, the San Mateo Caltrain station is
located approximately 1,500 feet north of the project site and is also within walking distance. There are
continuous pedestrian facilities connecting the project site to the various bus stops and the Caltrain
station. The project is anticipated to generate additional transit ridership on both the buses and Caltrain.
It is expected that the project-generated bus and train ridership would be relatively low and could be
accommodated within the existing bus and train capacities. In addition, Caltrain has plans to increase
the number of trains serving the San Mateo station from the existing 70 trains per day to 96 trains per
day during weekdays as part of the Caltrain electrification project.

Site Access and Circulation
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveway with regard to corner sight
distance and traffic volumes. The project proposes one driveway on Claremont Street approximately 85
feet north of the intersection with 4th Avenue. This driveway would provide access to two levels of
below-grade parking with 82 parking spaces. The driveway is proposed to be 22 feet wide, which meets
the City’s requirement.
Queuing at the Project Driveway
A queuing analysis was conducted at the project driveway to determine whether inbound and/or
outbound vehicle queues would considerably affect traffic operations on the surface streets and within
the parking garage. The analysis concludes that the northbound left-turn vehicles on Claremont Street
turning into the project driveway would create minimal queues on Claremont Street and would not
considerably affect traffic operations. Vehicles turning out of the project driveway would develop
minimal queues on-site and would not block a parked vehicle’s ability to maneuver out of an on-site
parking space.
Driveway Sight Distance
The project access points should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight distance,
thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles traveling
on adjacent roadways. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a driver’s ability to locate a gap
in traffic and see oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists. Adequate corner sight distance (sight distance
triangles) should be provided at all site access points in accordance with the Town’s standards. Sight
distance triangles should be measured approximately 15 feet back from the traveled way.

Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on Claremont
Street is 25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 150 feet. The
adjacent property to the north currently has its driveway (approximately 24 feet wide) adjacent to the
proposed driveway. Therefore, a driver turning right out of the project driveway would have sufficient
sight distance looking north at southbound vehicles on Claremont Street. The project proposes an on-
street loading zone (25 feet long) directly south of the project driveway. When loading trucks are not
present, a driver turning left out of the project driveway would have sufficient sight distance looking
south at northbound vehicles on Claremont Street. However, when loading trucks are present, the
necessary sight distance for left-turning drivers would be blocked.
Recommendations
It is recommended that the on-street loading zone be moved away from the driveway to ensure that the
adequate sight distance would be maintained at all times.




                                                                                            Page | 54

On-Site Circulation
According to the site plan, the proposed parking garage contains two levels of below-grade parking. All
levels of the garage are connected by 24-foot wide two-way ramps. These ramps meet the minimum
standards set forth by the City of San Mateo Zoning Code (Chapter 27.64 Off-Street parking). Driving
aisles on all levels are at least 24 feet wide when there is parking on either side of the aisle and meet
the City’s requirement for minimum aisle widths.

On the lower level of the parking garage, eleven parking spaces are proposed to be gated for
residential and office uses. It is assumed that the gate will be closed at all times except when activated
by users. Therefore, the gate could be treated as a dead-end. Per City requirements, all dead-end
aisles are required to provide at least three feet of turn-around space at the end of the aisle. The site
plan currently shows a turn-around space of only two feet and six inches.
Recommendations
It is recommended that the site plan be revised to provide at least three feet of turn-around space in the
lower parking level prior to the parking gate.
Emergency Vehicles, Truck Access and Circulation
All driveway and drive aisles are at least 20 feet wide and comply with the City requirement for
emergency vehicle access.

The project proposes a trash room on the ground floor adjacent to the project driveway on the west side
of the electrical room and staircases. The trash room would have an opening onto the garage ramp
before the ramp depresses down to the lower levels. Trash bins would be picked up from and returned
to the dedicated trash enclosure on the day of garbage collection. Garbage trucks would not enter the
project driveway.

Per City requirements, the project is required to provide one loading area on-site. The project proposes
to provide the loading area on-street immediately south of the project driveway. As discussed above, it
is recommended that the loading area be moved away from the driveway to ensure adequate sight
distance for vehicles exiting the project.

Parking
Hexagon conducted a parking study for the proposed project (see Appendix G). Hexagon estimated
that on average office buildings within downtown San Mateo are generating an average peak parking
demand rate of 1.82 spaces per 1,000 s.f. Based on this demand rate, Hexagon estimates that the
proposed office would generate a peak parking demand of 101 parking spaces. The project proposes
74 parking spaces for the office land use. It is anticipated that the proposed on-site office parking
supply would not be sufficient to accommodate the peak office parking demand. The project would be
required to pay a parking in-lieu fee to the City of San Mateo. Within two blocks (approximately 600
feet) of the project site, there are two public parking garages and one public parking lot that could
provide secondary parking supply for the project. Alternatively, employees might park on-street along
nearby streets. Hexagon did not conduct parking counts at the nearby public parking garages and lots
or on-street to determine whether any vacant parking spaces currently exist.

Signal Warrant Analysis
The intersection of Claremont Street and 5th Avenue is currently under all-way stop control. The level of
service analysis at this intersection showed that it would operate at acceptable levels of service under
all conditions. Signal warrant analysis was performed based on the peak-hour turning-movement
volumes projected at this intersection. The analysis concluded that the projected peak-hour traffic
volumes would not warrant signalization at this intersection (see Appendix D).
