        City of Seattle Department of Planning and Development
                    SEPA GHG Emissions Worksheet
                           Version 1.7 12/26/07

Introduction
The Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) requires environmental
review of development proposals that may have a significant adverse impact on
the environment. If a proposed development is subject to SEPA, the project
proponent is required to complete the SEPA Checklist. The Checklist includes
questions relating to the development's air emissions. The emissions that have
traditionally been considered cover smoke, dust, and industrial and automobile
emissions. With our understanding of the climate change impacts of GHG
emissions, the City of Seattle requires the applicant to also estimate these
emissions.

Emissions created by Development
GHG emissions associated with development come from multiple sources:
  • The extraction, processing, transportation, construction and disposal of
      materials and landscape disturbance (Embodied Emissions)
  • Energy demands created by the development after it is completed (Energy
      Emissions)
  • Transportation demands created by the development after it is completed
      (Transportation Emissions)

GHG Emissions Worksheet
This GHG Emissions Worksheet has been developed to assist applicants in
answering the SEPA Checklist question relating to GHG emissions. The
worksheet was originally developed by King County, but the City of Seattle and
King County are working together on future updates to maintain consistency of
methodologies across jurisdictions.

The SEPA GHG Emissions worksheet estimates all GHG emissions that will be
created over the life span of a project. This includes emissions associated with
obtaining construction materials, fuel used during construction, energy consumed
during a buildings operation, and transportation by building occupants.

Using the Worksheet
1. Descriptions of the different residential and commercial building types can be
   found on the second tabbed worksheet ("Definition of Building Types"). If a
   development proposal consists of multiple projects, e.g. both single family and
   multi-family residential structures or a commercial development that consists
   of more than on type of commercial activity, the appropriate information
   should be estimated for each type of building or activity.
2. For paving, estimate the total amount of paving (in thousands of square feet)
   of the project.

3. The Worksheet will calculate the amount of GHG emissions associated with
   the project and display the amount in the "Total Emissions" column on the
   worksheet. The applicant should use this information when completing the
   SEPA checklist.

4. The last three worksheets in the Excel file provide the background information
   that is used to calculate the total GHG emissions.

5. The methodology of creating the estimates is transparent; if there is reason to
   believe that a better estimate can be obtained by changing specific values, this
   can and should be done. Changes to the values should be documented with
   an explanation of why and the sources relied upon.

6. Print out the “Total Emissions” worksheet and attach it to the SEPA checklist.
   If the applicant has made changes to the calculations or the values, the
   documentation supporting those changes should also be attached to the
   SEPA checklist.

                                       Therefore, the average life span of residential buildings is being used until a better approximation can be ascertained.

South Lake Union EIS

The South Lake Union EIS states that the increased amount of buildings would increase the
cumulative level of artificial illumination in South Lake Union under all alternatives. The new
buildings would include towers that may potentially incorporate reflective surfaces that could on
occasion create glare-related impacts. The exposure may extend to adjacent hillsides and the
freeway because of the topographic basin that comprises the South Lake Union neighborhood.
The level of building and site lighting, as well as the potential for reflective solar glare, would be
greater than existing conditions, incrementally expanding with the density of development.

EIS Addendum – Project Impacts

Principal sources of light that presently occur proximate to the project site include streetlights
along Denny Way, Terry Ave., Westlake Ave. N., and 9th Ave. N.; light from headlights of vehicles
operating on adjacent streets and maneuvering within parking lots; and building lighting (interior
and in some instances low-level exterior) in the immediate area of the site.

While vehicle headlights and glazing (and/or specular surfaces on vehicles) occasionally create
glare, the principal source of glare associated with most development projects is sunlight reflected
from specular surfaces on building facades. Factors influencing the amount of reflective solar
glare that may occur include: weather (e.g., cloud cover); building height, width and orientation
of the façade relative to the viewer; percent of the façade that is glazed or composed of specular
material; reflectivity of the glass or specular surfaces; design relationship between the glazed and
non-glazed portions of the façade (e.g., glass inset from the sash, horizontal and vertical
modulation); the color and texture of building materials that comprise the façade; and the proximity
of other intervening structures and/or landscaping.

The 970 Denny Way Development would replace the existing building and surface parking with
one high-rise building containing residential dwellings, retail space, outdoor amenity space on the
roof of the podium and on the roof of the tower, as well as below-grade vehicular parking. Such
development would result in an increased number of vehicles entering and exiting the project site,
with the potential for localized increases in light and glare associated with vehicle headlights. In
addition, building lighting (interior and low-level exterior) is expected to add to the pedestrian-
scale ambient light level in the immediate area of the site. No significant light or glare-related
impacts associated these activities, however, is anticipated.

The proposed 970 Denny Way Development would be adjacent to Denny Way and proximate
to Westlake Ave. N.; both of these streets are designated principal arterials and each carry
significant volumes of traffic to, from, and through the South Lake Union neighborhood. As
required by SMC 23.47A.022 E., a solar glare analysis has been performed for the proposed 970
Denny Way Development. The analysis addresses probable environmental impacts to vehicular
traffic on these two arterials during the AM and PM peak traffic periods and qualitatively evaluates
solar glare-related impacts on nearby residential structures Figures 1 through 4 depict reflected
solar glare from the proposed project at two times of the day during each of the four key days of
the solar year -- vernal equinox (approx. March 21st), summer solstice (approx. June 21st),

autumnal equinox (approx. September 21st), and winter solstice (approx. December 21st). The
two times of the day (8 AM and 5 PM1) reflect peak hour traffic periods for Denny Way and
Westlake Avenue N. The pattern of potential, solar glare that is depicted in Figure 1 through 4
reflects the curvature of the east and west facades of the proposed tower.

Due to the rise in topography west of the project site, a building cross-section diagram that aligns
with Denny Way has been prepared for the 5PM time period for each key day of the year (Figures
1a – 4a). The cross sections provide a greater level of detail concerning potential impacts of
reflected solar glare relative to the site plan for each key solar time period and they more
accurately detail the relationship of the proposed project with existing and proposed buildings
west of the site. It should be noted, however, that solar glare-related impacts may also occur at
other times of the day and days of the year. Also, because of the earth’s rotation, the duration of
reflected solar glare impacts will vary – from several minutes2 for a stationary observer to
substantially less for a mobile observer.

Existing and future structures and, to an extent, vegetation can mitigate the environmental
impacts of reflected solar glare from glazing. Such can occur if these mitigating factors are located
between the sun and the glass or specular surface, or between the reflective surface of the façade
and the area potentially affected by reflected solar glare. While coniferous and/or evergreen
vegetation typically afford the greatest amount of mitigation at lower elevations, at times
deciduous vegetation can also restrict the amount of solar glare that is reflected from glazing --
from approximately late April to late October when leaves are present. Street trees that are
proposed adjacent to the project site would be deciduous. Between late October and late April,
while the amount of glare restriction afforded by deciduous trees is substantially less (influenced
by the density of the branches), even during this time of the year they can partially restrict the
amount of reflected solar glare emanating from glazed surfaces below a height of 20-30 ft.

While all figures have been adjusted to compensate for existing buildings and the surrounding
topography, they depict a worst-case scenario in that they cannot accurately depict the following
factors that would further limit the extent of possible reflected solar glare:

             the mitigating effect of existing and/or proposed street trees;
             the mitigating effect of future, intervening buildings, and
             the final extent of façade curvature, modulation and building materials .

A key consideration for motorists is the effect of potential solar glare on a driver’s cone-of-
influence.3 The cone-of-influence is defined as the driver’s viewing area and is within 20 degrees
of the horizontal that points in the direction of vehicle travel. This typically represents the most
sensitive viewing area for motorists. Glare impacts that occur outside the 20-degree cone-of-
influence are considered less critical.

As noted, SMC 23.47A.022 E. also pertains to glare impacts associated with nearby residential
uses. Analysis indicates that at certain times of the year and times of day – assuming that weather
conditions are suitable (e.g., not raining or overcast) -- reflected solar glare from the façades of
the proposed 970 Denny Way Development buildings could be noticeable to residents in nearby
buildings. While the effect on nearby residents may at times be noticeable, no significant long-

    vertically every 15 minutes in June to 3 degrees horizontally and 1 degree vertically every 15 minutes in December.

term impact is anticipated partly due to mitigating effects such as less-reflective buildings
materials being used, building curvature and modulation, and other measures listed later in this
section, as well as the fact that reflected glare, if it occurs, would be limited in duration and
contingent on clear weather.

The following is a seasonal breakdown of possible reflected glare impacts associated with the
proposed project for the AM and PM peak traffic timeframes.

Vernal Equinox – Approximately March 21st (refer to Figures 1 and 1a)

Climatic data indicate that March typically has 3 clear days, 6 partly cloudy days and 22 cloudy
days.4 Glare is not likely off the building on the 22 cloudy days/month, or the cloudy portions of
the 6 days/month.

            At 8 AM, reflected solar glare would extend from portions of the south and east facades
             of the proposed building to the southwest and northeast, respectively. Reflected solar
             glare could potentially affect eastbound vehicular traffic on Denny Way in the vicinity
             of Westlake Ave. N. Reflected solar glare occurring at this time of the day and day of
             the year from the south façade of the building would be within the cone of influence for
             eastbound motorists on Denny Way between 9th and Terry (2 blocks) and, depending
             upon travel speed, could affect motorists for approximately 1 second. Such is not
             expected to cause significant problems for motorists nor differ substantially from
             periodic glare that motorists typically experience from stationary and mobile sources.

            At 5 PM, reflected solar glare would extend from the south and west facades of the
             proposed building in westerly and very limited southeasterly directions. As illustrated
             in Figure 1, reflected solar glare extending to the northwest could potentially affect
             motorists on Westlake Ave. N. between John St. and Denny Way, and eastbound
             motorists on Denny Way between Dexter Ave. N. and Westlake Ave. N. Reflected
             solar glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the west façade
             of the building would be outside the cone of influence for north or southbound motorists
             on Westlake Ave. N. As illustrated in Figure 1a, reflected solar glare occurring at this
             time of the day and day of the year from the west façade of the building would,
             however, be within the cone of influence for eastbound motorists on Denny Way
             between Dexter Ave. and 9th Ave. N. (distance of two blocks) and could affect motorists
             for approximately 11 seconds, assuming normal travel speeds. However, glare is not
             expected to cause problems for motorists due to the fact that: 1) during this time of
             day, traffic is usually moving very slowly due to high levels of congestion along
             eastbound Denny Way giving drivers adequate time to react to potential glare-related
             impacts, and 2) the 11-story Rollin Street Flats building, which is located directly to the
             west of the proposed 970 Denny Way building, as well as the large trees located within
             Denny Park that overhang onto Denny Way in the

               vicinity of the park would block a substantial amount of street-level glare from the
               proposed building.5

               Reflected solar glare extending to the southeast from the south façade of the proposed
               building at this time of day could potentially affect westbound traffic on Denny Way,
               but only in the vicinity of its intersection with Terry Ave. While noticeable, this glare
               would be mostly outside the cone-of-influence for motorists on this street and would
               not be expected to cause problems for motorists nor differ substantially from periodic
               glare from stationary and mobile sources that motorists typically experience.

Summer Solstice – Approximately June 21st (refer to Figures 2 and 2a)

Climatic data indicate that June typically has 5 clear days, 8 partly cloudy days and 17 cloudy
days.6 Glare is not likely off the building on the 17 cloudy days/month, or the cloudy portion of 8
days/month.

              At 8 AM, reflected solar glare would extend from portions of the east facade of the
               proposed building to the east. Reflected solar glare could potentially affect westbound
               vehicular traffic on Denny Way, but only in the vicinity of Terry Ave. Reflected solar
               glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the east façade would
               be within the cone of influence for westbound motorists on Denny Way and could affect
               motorists for less than 1 second. However, it is not expected to cause problems for
               motorists nor differ substantially from periodic glare from stationary and mobile
               sources that motorists typically experience.

              At 5 PM, reflected solar glare would extend from the south and west facades of the
               proposed building in northwesterly and limited southeasterly directions. As illustrated
               in Figure 2, reflected solar glare extending to the northwest could be noticeable to
               motorists on Westlake Ave. N. between John St. and Denny Way, but outside their
               cone of influence. As illustrated in Figure 2a, reflected solar glare extending to the
               west could, however, affect eastbound motorists on Denny Way between 9th Ave. N.
               and Westlake Ave. N.




5   In addition, proposed residential and office buildings (MUP #s 3017320, 3017687, 3017321 and 3017686), represented by dotted lines on
    the Block 48/89 project site in Figure 1a, if built, would essentially block most of the solar glare that could potentially be reflected by the
    proposed 970 Denny Way building. Since the MUPs for these structures have not been approved, the probable effect of these buildings
    has not been depicted in plan-view on Figure 1.

                Reflected solar glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the
                west façade of the building would be within the cone of influence for eastbound
                motorists on Denny Way and could affect motorists for approximately 5 seconds,
                assuming normal travel speeds. However, glare is not expected to cause problems
                for motorists due to the fact that: 1) during this time of day, traffic is usually moving
                very slowly due to high levels of congestion along eastbound Denny Way giving
                drivers adequate time to react to potential glare-related impacts, and 2) the 11-story
                Rollin Street Flats building, which is located directly to the west of the proposed 970
                Denny Way building, as well as the large trees located within Denny Park that
                overhang onto Denny Way in the vicinity of the park would block a substantial amount
                of street-level glare from the proposed building.7

                Reflected solar glare extending to the southeast from the south façade of the

                from stationary and mobile sources that motorists typically experience.

Autumnal Equinox – Approximately September 21st (refer to Figures 3 and 3a)

Climatic data indicate that September typically has 8 clear days, 9 partly cloudy days and 13
cloudy days. 8 Glare is not likely off the building on the cloudy 13 days/month, or the cloudy
portions of 9 days/month.

              At 8 AM, reflected solar glare would extend from portions of the south and east facades
               of the proposed building to the southwest and northeast, respectively. Reflected solar
               glare could potentially affect eastbound vehicular traffic on Denny Way, but only in the
               vicinity of Westlake Ave. N. Reflected solar glare occurring at this time of the day and
               day of the year from the south façade of the building would be within the cone of
               influence for eastbound motorists on Denny Way and could affect motorists for less

               At 5 PM, reflected solar glare would extend from the south and west facades of the
                proposed building in westerly and limited southeasterly directions. As illustrated in
                Figure 3, reflected solar glare extending to the west could be noticeable to motorists
                on Westlake Ave. N. between John St. and Denny Way, but outside their cone of
                influence. As illustrated in Figure 3a, reflected solar glare extending to the west could
                also affect eastbound motorists on Denny way between Dexter Ave. N. and 9th Ave.
                N. Reflected solar glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the
                west façade of the building would be within the cone of influence for eastbound
                motorists on Denny Way and could affect motorists for approximately 13 seconds,
                assuming normal travel speeds. However, glare is not expected to cause problems
                for motorists due to the fact that: 1) during this time of day, traffic is usually moving
                very slowly due to high levels of congestion along eastbound Denny Way giving drivers
                adequate time to react to potential glare-related impacts, and 2) the 11-story Rollin
                Street Flats building, which is located directly to the west of the proposed 970 Denny
                Way building, as well as the large trees located within Denny Park that overhang onto
                Denny Way in the vicinity of the park would block a substantial amount of street-level
                glare from the proposed building.9

                Reflected solar glare extending to the southeast from the south façade of the proposed
                building could be noticeable to westbound traffic on Denny Way between Terry Ave.
                and Boren Ave (2 blocks). Such, however, would be outside the cone-of-influence for
                westbound motorists on this street and would not be expected to cause problems for
                motorists nor differ substantially from periodic glare from stationary and mobile
                sources that motorists typically experience.

Winter Solstice – Approximately December 21st (refer to Figures 4 and 4a)

Climatic data indicate that December typically has 2 clear days, 4 partly cloudy days and 25 cloudy
days.10 On this day of the year at 8:30 AM and 4 PM the altitude of the sun above the horizon is
approximately 2 degrees, therefore, reflected solar glare distances are great. Glare is not likely
off the building on the cloudy 25 days/month, or the cloudy portions of 4 days/month.

               At 8:30 AM, reflected solar glare would extend from portions of the south and east
                facades of the proposed building in limited southwesterly and narrow northeasterly
                directions. Reflected solar glare could be noticeable to motorists eastbound on Denny
                Way, but only between Westlake Ave. N. and Terry Ave (1 block). Reflected solar
                glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the south façade of the
                building, however, would be outside the cone of influence for eastbound motorists on
                Denny Way and is not expected to cause problems for motorists nor differ
                substantially from periodic glare from stationary and mobile sources that motorists
                typically experience.




9    In addition, proposed residential and office buildings (MUP #s 3017320, 3017687, 3017321 and 3017686), represented by dotted lines on
     the Block 48/89 project site in Figure 3a, if built, would essentially block most of the solar glare that could potentially be reflected by the
     proposed 970 Denny Way building. Since the MUPs for these structures have not been approved, the probable effect of these buildings
     has not been depicted in plan-view on Figure 3

 Note: The solid color within the glare outline
 represents the actual glare from the proposed
 building that would be experienced in the sur-
 rounding area. The area that is not shaded
 represents the potential glare area that would be
 interrupted by an intervening structure/vegetation
 of some kind.

                   At 4 PM, reflected solar glare would extend from the south and west facades of the
                    proposed building in limited southeast and broad northwest directions. As illustrated
                    in Figure 4, reflected solar glare extending to the northwest and southeast could
                    potentially affect motorists on Denny Way. As illustrated in Figure 4a, reflected solar
                    glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the west façades of the
                    building would not affect eastbound or west bound motorists on Denny Way due to the
                    fact that the 11-story Rollin Street Flats building, which is located directly to the west
                    of the proposed 970 Denny Way building, would block a substantial amount of street-
                    level glare from the proposed building.11

                    Reflected solar glare occurring at this time of the day and day of the year from the
                    south façade of the building could be noticeable to westbound motorists on Denny
                    Way, but only in the vicinity of Terry Ave. Such, however, would be outside their cone
                    of influence and would not be expected to cause problems for motorists nor differ
                    substantially from periodic glare from stationary and mobile sources that motorists
                    typically experience.

Potential Mitigation Measures

The following measures could help reduce any overall potential light and reflected solar glare-
related impacts from the proposed project.

          Building façade materials are finalized, and the facades of the building tower include a metal
           and glass window wall structure with glass spandrel panels and metal frames. The east and
           west tower facades are curved which will fragment any generated glare. The east, west and
           south tower facades are composed of approximately 55% dark gray spandrel glass, 10%
           white spandrel glass, 5% dark gray louvers, and 30% clear vision glass. All spandrel and
           vision glass is non-mirrored, non-reflective glass. The City’s West Design Review Board
           (DRB) recommended approval of these material elements and design, as well as the
           façade modulation and curvature, which is expected to lessen potential reflected solar glare-
           related impacts. Final, actual reflectivity of the glazing will be dictated by the nature of glass
           that is specified and the requirements set forth by the City's Energy Code and the LEED
           energy requirements. No excessively-reflective surfaces (i.e., mirrored glass, or polished
           metals) that go beyond what is required to meet energy-related code provisions are
           proposed anywhere on the exterior of the project buildings.

          The proposed street trees and the use of building materials with relatively low-reflectivity at
           street level would minimize reflective glare-related impacts to pedestrians, motorists and
           nearby residents.

          Pedestrian-scale lighting would be provided consistent with code, function and safety
           requirements. Exterior lighting would include fixtures to direct the light downward and/or
           upward and away from off-site land uses.




11       In addition, proposed residential and office buildings (MUP #s 3017320, 3017687, 3017321 and 3017686), represented by dotted lines on
         the Block 48/89 project site in Figure 4a, if built, would essentially block most of the solar glare that could potentially be reflected by the
         proposed 970 Denny Way building. Since the MUPs for these structures have not been approved, the probable effect of these buildings
         has not been depicted in plan-view on Figure 4

    The project site is adjacent to existing and proposed high-rise developments to the west,
     southwest, and south (Rollin Street Flats, 2200 Westlake, ENSO, Block 48), and is near the
     lowest point of Denny Way between I-5 and Broad St. As well, the large trees located within
     Denny Park overhang on Denny Way in the vicinity of Denny Park and could block a
     substantial amount of street-level glare along Denny Way from the proposed building.
     These factors may block or lessen incoming rays from the sun and reflected solar glare at
     street-level during the AM and PM peak hours, thereby minimizing reflective solar glare-
     related impacts to pedestrians, motorists and nearby residents at these times of day.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Impacts

No significant unavoidable adverse impacts are anticipated.

South Lake Union EIS

Comparison of the alternatives in the South Lake Union EIS reveals slight differences in the
shadow impacts to Denny Park, Cascade Park, and Lake Union Park, as well as other SEPA-
protected places. The location and extent of shadows vary, with the impacts associated with
Alternative 1 representing greater impacts than the other alternatives. The South Lake Union
EIS notes that shadows would generally be longest during winter afternoons when the sun is
lower on the horizon. At noon on winter solstice, when the sun angle is low on the horizon,
shadow impacts could extend great distances and result from each alternative. Conversely, in
the noon timeframe on summer solstice, when the sun is at its greatest height above the
horizon, shadow impacts would be shorter and would be less likely to cause impacts. However,
overall, the shadow impacts are not expected to result in significant adverse environmental
impacts. The impacts are typical of an urbanizing area that is transitioning from lower intensity
development to that of more intensive development.

EIS Addendum – Project Specific Impacts

Seattle’s SEPA policies aim to “minimize or prevent light blockage and the creation of shadows
on open spaces most used by the public.”1 Since the project site is north of Denny Way, areas
outside of Downtown that are to be protected2 include:

       publicly-owned parks;
       public schoolyards;
       private schools which allow public use of schoolyards during non-school hours; and
       publicly owned street ends in shoreline areas.

The nearest such protected areas that are proximate to the project site are Denny Park, Lake
Union Park, and Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

Factors that influence the extent of shading include: weather (e.g., cloud cover); building height,
width and facade orientation; and the proximity of other intervening structures, topographic
variations and significant landscaping. The extent of possible shading from the proposed
development must also be considered within the context of climatic data for the month (e.g., on
average the number of clear, partly cloudy and cloudy days).

The project site is part of the South Lake Union Urban Center; surrounding development is a
mix of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings. The maximum height of existing buildings within
several blocks of the project site ranges from one to approximately 15 stories. There are
several large buildings within several blocks in all directions of the project site that are either
under construction or have received the required land use approvals to begin construction.

These together with existing buildings surrounding the project site will influence the amount of
localized, area-wide shading that occurs at and proximate to the project site.

This section of the EIS Addendum contains shadow diagrams that depict shading from the
Proposed Action for vernal equinox (approx. March 21st), summer solstice (approx. June 21st),
autumnal equinox (approx. Sept. 21st) and winter solstice (approx. December 21st). Potential
impacts depicting shadows from the proposed project, together with shadows from other nearby
existing buildings, were evaluated at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM (9 AM, 12 PM and 4 PM on the
winter solstice). The figures and the accompanying text below describe probable shadow
impacts to the three parks in the site vicinity (Denny Park, Lake Union Park, and Cascade
Playground and P-Patch) as a result of the Proposed Action, within the context of shading that
presently occurs from existing buildings proximate to the site. The City’s SEPA policies address
shadow impacts with consideration given to the effect “at times when the public most frequently
uses that space.”3

The following analysis summarizes shadow impacts for various times of the day on each of the
key days of the solar year. These key days of the solar year and times of the day depict worst-
case impacts. Shadow-related impacts, however, can also occur at other times of the day
throughout the year. Because of the earth’s rotation, the duration of shadow-related impacts
varies for a stationary observer4 based on season, depending upon the width of the shadow.
The shadow graphics have been adjusted to compensate for topography and, in the case of
vernal equinox, summer solstice, and autumnal equinox, daylight savings time.5

Vernal (Spring) Equinox (refer to Figure 1)

Sunrise on vernal equinox (approx. March 21st) occurs at about 6:11 AM and sunset at 6:21 PM.
Data6 indicate that on average March has 4 clear days, 8 partly cloudy days and 19 cloudy
days.7 Pacific Daylight Savings Time is in-effect on this day.

       At 8 AM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northwesterly direction
        and would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

       At 12 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northerly direction and
        would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

       At 5 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northeasterly direction
        and would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

Summer Solstice (refer to Figure 2)

Sunrise on summer solstice (approx. June 21st) occurs at about 5:11 AM and sunset at 9:10
PM. Data8 indicate that on average June has 7 clear days, 8 partly cloudy days and 15 cloudy
days. Pacific Daylight Savings Time remains in-effect on this day.

        At 8 AM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a westerly direction and
         would not affect Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch. Shadows could
         extend into a small portion of Denny Park, along the eastern edge. This area of the park
         is in open space and pedestrian pathways and is used for passive recreation. Shadows
         from other buildings in the vicinity would also contribute to shading Denny Park at this
         time of day. Overall, less than 5 percent of Denny Park would be shaded by the
         proposed building, and the Park already has extensive tree canopy under existing
         conditions, which contributes to shading. Therefore no significant impacts would be
         anticipated.

        At 12 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northerly direction and
         would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

        At 5 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in an easterly direction and
         would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

Autumnal Equinox (refer to Figure 3)

Sunrise on autumnal equinox (approx. September 21st) occurs at about 6:13 AM and
sunset at 8:11 PM. Climatic data9 for the month of September indicate that on average
September typically has 3 clear days, 6 partly cloudy days and 22 cloudy days. Pacific
Daylight Savings Time remains in-effect on this day.

        At 8 AM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northwesterly direction
         and would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

        At 12 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northerly direction and
         would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch

        At 5 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in an easterly direction and
         would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

Winter Solstice (refer to Figure 4)

Sunrise on winter solstice (approx. December 21st) occurs at about 7:54 AM and sunset at 5:19
PM. Data10 indicate that on average December has 3 clear days, 4 partly cloudy days and 23
cloudy days.11 Pacific Standard Time remains in-effect on this day.

      At 9 AM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northwesterly direction
       and would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

      At 12 PM, shadows from the Proposed Action would extend in a northerly direction and
       would not affect Denny Park, Lake Union Park or Cascade Playground and P-Patch.

      At 4 PM, the sun is lower on the horizon and shadows extend a greater distance.
       Shadows would extend in a northeasterly direction and shadows from the Proposed
       Action would not affect Denny Park or Lake Union Park. Shadows could extend into a
       portion of Cascade Playground, within the north half of the park. This area of the park is
       in open space, a playground and playfield and is used for passive and active recreation.
       The P-Patch would not be affected. Shadows from other buildings in the vicinity would
       also contribute to shading Cascade Park at this time of day; nearly the entire park would
       be shaded. Overall, because other buildings are contributing to shading, and given the
       time of year, typical weather, and lack of sunny days, shading impacts would not be
       considered significant. This would not be expected to be a time of high park use.

As described above, the proposed development would not affect Lake Union Park or the
Cascade P-Patch. The development would contribute to shading a small portion of Denny Park
during the Summer Solstice at 8 AM, and to shading a portion of Cascade Park during the
Winter Solstice at 4 PM. However, because only a very small portion of Denny Park would be
affected during the Summer Solstice, and shading would occur to Cascade Playground during a
time of the year when less use of the park would be anticipated, overall, shadow impacts
associated with the Proposed Action are not considered significant.

Potential Mitigation Measures

No significant impacts would occur and no mitigation is proposed.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Impacts

No significant unavoidable adverse impacts are anticipated.

outside the South Lake Union neighborhood will be potentially impacted by all alternatives at full
build-out, although none of the protected views are significantly impacted. It was noted that the
most significant changes would involve views from Lake Union Park and the I-5/Mercer Off-
ramp; less significant changes would occur to views from Volunteer Park.

While no significant impacts were identified relative to protected viewpoints as a result of the
programmatic analysis, notable impacts to views valued within the neighborhood were
identified. These currently unprotected views include views toward the Space Needle from Lake
Union Park, along Thomas and John Streets, and views toward the open sky above Lake Union
looking north along Fairview Avenue N, Boren Avenue N and Westlake Avenue N.

EIS Addendum – Project Impacts

The proposed 970 Denny Way Development would result in impacts similar to those described
in the South Lake Union EIS. The proposed complex has been designed to be consistent with
provisions of the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan and the existing zoning. The proposed
project would blend into the Downtown and South Lake Union skyline and would be consistent
with other high-rise buildings proposed in this portion of the City (such as the 42-story tower
proposed to the west, 111 Westlake Avenue N) and as allowed by the City’s Land Use Code.
The proposed 970 Denny Way Development would not result in any significant impacts to
designated view corridors, scenic views, City Landmarks, or scenic routes (see Figures 1 and 2
of this appendix for locations of viewshed images). Views of the Downtown skyline, the Space
Needle, the Olympic Mountains, Elliott Bay and Lake Union would still be possible from
designated public viewpoints.

The City’s public view protection policies are intended to “protect public views of significant
natural and human-made features: Mount Rainier, the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, the
downtown skyline, and major bodies of water including Puget Sound, Lake Washington, Lake
Union and the Ship Canal, from public places consisting of specified viewpoints, parks, scenic
routes, and view corridors identified in Attachment 1” to the SEPA code.1 Of the City’s 87
officially-designated public viewpoints, only three could be affected by the proposed project –
Plymouth Pillars Park, Volunteer Park, and Bhy Kracke Park. These viewpoints are described
below:

       Volunteer Park is a 48-acre park containing many features including: paths, open
        space, a museum, conservatory, tennis courts, and a bandstand. The park’s viewpoint
        is located at the observation deck of the Water Tower. A 360-degree view of the City is
        possible from the deck at a height of approximately 75 ft. above street level (520 ft.

        elevation). The Volunteer Park Water Tower is located in the Capitol Hill Neighborhood,
        roughly 1.1 miles northeast of the project site. This designated viewpoint provides
        southwesterly views toward the project area from the tower including views of the Space
        Needle, the Downtown Seattle skyline, the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound. During
        part of the year, views of portions of the South Lake Union neighborhood from this
        location are obscured by mature deciduous trees.

       Bhy Kracke Park - This park is located on the southeast side of Queen Anne Hill, west
        of Lake Union (1215 - 5th Avenue N) and approximately 0.8 mile northwest of the site.
        This designated viewpoint provides southeasterly views toward the project area. The
        park is situated on a hillside and features a narrow pedestrian path that winds from the
        bottom to the top of the hill. From the outlook at its highest point, Bhy Kracke Park offers
        views of the Downtown Seattle skyline, Mount Rainier, the Space Needle and Lake
        Union. Only portions of the South Lake Union neighborhood are visible from higher
        elevations in the park and even then, part of the view of the study area is obscured
        during portions of the year by mature deciduous trees.

       Plymouth Pillars Park – is located at the base of Capitol Hill within the Pike-Pine
        corridor, roughly 0.35 miles southeast of the project site. Amenities within this linear 0.6
        acre park include an off-leash dog area, seating, public art and a pedestrian corridor.2
        This designated viewpoint provides westerly views toward the project area that include a
        close-in panoramic view of the Downtown Seattle Skyline.

The viewshed from each of these viewpoints was analyzed and a photosimulation has been
prepared to depict the massing of the new building as it would appear from each viewpoint. The
analysis shows the proposed project, in context with existing development.

       Viewpoint 1 - Figure 3 shows the existing and potential views from the Volunteer Park
        Water Tower. As demonstrated, while portions of the 970 Denny Way Development
        would be visible and would partially obstruct a portion of water and mountains visible in
        the distance, the proposed new building would blend into the existing Downtown building
        massing that occurs surrounding the project site. The visual density of the skyline would
        slightly increase and extend to the north. Overall, no significant view impacts are
        anticipated from this viewpoint.

       Viewpoint 2 - Figure 4 depicts the existing view from Bhy Kracke Park and includes a
        panoramic view of the South Lake Union Neighborhood and the Downtown Seattle
        skyline. The Space Needle is also visible. As shown, the site is partially obstructed from
        certain locations in the park due to the presence of existing trees and vegetation. As
        illustrated in Figure 4, the new development would appear as a continuation of the
        existing massing of Downtown high-rise buildings and no significant view impacts are
        anticipated from this viewpoint.

       Viewpoints 3a and 3b - Figures 5 and 6 show the existing and potential views from two
        locations at Plymouth Pillars Park; Viewpoint 3a is from the south end of the park, near
        the Pillars, and Viewpoint 3b is from the north end, near the area of the off leash dog
        area.

As demonstrated, from Viewpoint 3a, the new building associated with the 970 Denny Way
Development would appear as an extension of the massing of existing Downtown
development. From Viewpoint 3b, the proposed building would not be visible due to
intervening buildings in the foreground.

In addition to view protection policies associated with officially-designated viewpoints, it is also
City policy to “protect public views of historic landmarks designated by the City’s Landmarks
Preservation Board which, because of their prominence of location or contrasts of siting, age, or
scale are easily identifiable visual features of their neighborhood or the City and contribute to
the distinctive quality or identity of their neighborhood or the City.”3 In the Downtown
neighborhood, the City has designated 62 structures or objects as official City Landmarks.
Each of these structures is at least 25 years old and each meets one or more of the City’s
designation criteria.4 There are no designated Landmarks in the immediate vicinity of the site.

The most visible Landmark from many parts of the City is the Space Needle, which is located
approximately one and one-quarter miles northwest of the project site. The City has identified
ten viewpoints from which views of the Space Needle are to be protected.5. The designated
Space Needle view corridor that is closest to the project site is Volunteer Park on Capitol Hill. 6
The Volunteer Park viewpoint is from the water feature/reservoir in front of the Seattle Asian Art
Museum. The existing and proposed view from this location is described below.

       Viewpoint 4 - Figure 7 depicts the Volunteer Park reservoir in the foreground, with the
        Space Needle visible in the distance, partially obscured by existing vegetation. As
        demonstrated, the proposed project would be partially visible to the left of the Space
        Needle. Views of the Space Needle would not be affected.

City ordinances7 also identify specific scenic routes throughout the City in which view protection
is to be encouraged of the significant natural and human-made features listed in the City’s
public view protection policies. In the vicinity of the project site, there is one designated Scenic
Route; Fairview Avenue N. Scenic views from Fairview Avenue N include views of Lake Union
to the north and Downtown Seattle to the south.

       Viewpoint 5 - Figure 8 depicts the view from Fairview Avenue N at the intersection with
        Denny Way looking west. The proposed project site is to the west (right). The Space
        Needle is visible in the mid-field view. As indicated by Figure 8, the new 970 Denny
        Way tower would be visible from this viewpoint and would partially obstruct the view of
        the Space Needle. The overall visual effect would be an intensification of the existing
        urban density and greater vertical definition of the South Lake Union Neighborhood. No
        significant viewshed impacts are anticipated from this scenic route. Although the view of
        the Space Needle would be affected, this is not a protected Space Needle viewpoint and
        therefore this impact is not considered significant.
