The purpose of this Environmental Checklist is to identify and evaluate environmental impacts
that could result from the Proposed Action, and to identify measures to mitigate those impacts.
The Proposed Action would involve development of a project site located in Seattle’s Belltown
Urban Center Village. For purposes of this analysis, the project is referred to as 3rd & Lenora.
The proposed development would consist of a 38-story, approximately 569,604-sq. ft. retail,
office, and residential building with five levels of underground parking.
                                            1
The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) requires that all governmental agencies consider
the environmental impacts of a proposal before the proposal is decided upon. This
Environmental Checklist has been prepared in compliance with the State Environmental Policy
Act; the SEPA Rules, effective April 4, 1984, as amended (Chapter 197-11, Washington
Administrative Code); and the Seattle City Code (25.05), which implements SEPA.

This document is intended to serve as SEPA review for the site preparation work, building
construction, and operation of the proposed 3rd & Lenora project. Analysis contained in this
Environmental Checklist is based on Master Use Permit (MUP) plans for the project, which are
on-file with the Seattle Department of Planning and Development (DPD) (MUP # 3018686).
While not construction-level detail, the schematic plans accurately represent the eventual size,
location, and configuration of the proposed structure and are considered adequate for analysis
and disclosure of environmental impacts.

This Environmental Checklist is organized into three major sections. Section A of the Checklist
(starting on page 1) provides background information on the Proposed Action (e.g., purpose,
proponent/contact person, project description, project location, etc.). Section B (beginning on
page 14) contains the analysis of environmental impacts that could result from implementation
of the proposed project, based on review of major environmental parameters. This section also
identifies possible mitigation measures. Section C (page 41) contains the signature of the
proponent, confirming the completeness of this Environmental Checklist.

Relevant technical analyses that served as a basis for this Environmental Checklist include: the
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Worksheet (EA, 2015); the Solar Glare Analysis (EA, 2015); the
Historic Resources Services Letter (The Johnson Partnership, 2015); and the Transportation
Impact Analysis (Transpo Group, 2015). These documents have been submitted as part of the
MUP application for the 3rd & Lenora project, and are included in the project files at DPD. They
are also included in this Environmental Checklist as Appendices A, B, C, and D, respectively.

11.     Give a brief, complete description of your proposal, including the
        proposed uses and the size of the project and site. There are
        several questions later in this checklist that ask you to describe
        certain aspects of your proposal. You do not need to repeat
        those answers on this page.

        Overview

        The proposed 3rd & Lenora project is located in the Belltown Urban Center Village of
        Seattle (see Figure 1 for a regional map, Figure 2 for a vicinity map, and Figure 3 for
        an existing conditions map). The half-block project area consists of three lots,
        approximately 19,440-sq. ft., on the northern half of the block. The project site is
        bounded by 3rd Avenue to the east, a residential building (under construction) to the
        south, a mid-block alley to the west, and Lenora Street to the north. 2

        A 38-story, 440-ft. tall, approximately 569,604-sq. ft. retail, office, and residential building
        is proposed for the site. The proposed development includes five floors of underground
        parking with an estimated 270 available spaces, and levels 01 and 02 include ground
        level retail, as well as office and residential lobbies, and loading and building
        infrastructure. The retail and lobby floors are followed by 11 levels of office space and 25
        levels of residential space (with 384 residential units). Levels 37 and 38 include indoor
        common recreational space.

        Existing Site Conditions

        The project site contains three one- to two-story office buildings that abut each other
        along the parcel boundary line. More specifically, they are:

             •   The Jewish Federation Building – A two-story, approximately 18,360-sq. ft. office
                 building, built in 1919 located on the northwestern edge of the site at 2031 3rd
                 Avenue;
             •   The Pathé Building – An one-story, approximately 5,040-sq. ft. office building,
                 built in 1923 and located at 2025 3rd Avenue, directly to the southeast of the
                 Jewish Federation Building; and,
             •   A two-story, approximately 14,900-sq. ft. office building, built in 1918 located at
                 2019 3rd Avenue, directly to the southeast of the Pathé building.

        Proposed Development

        The proposed development is represented in the plans and text contained in MUP
        #3018686. As described in those materials, it is proposed that construction and
        development of the 3rd & Lenora begin in the third quarter of 2016 with occupancy
        proposed for the second quarter of 2018. The proposed site plan for the project is

        shown in Figure 4; proposed building elevations are depicted in Figures 5 and 6; and
        an architectural rendering of the project is provided in Figure 7.

        Buildings and Uses

        The total development – above-grade and below-grade – that is proposed for this project
        would approximate 569,604-sq. ft. of gross floor area. The nature and amount of above
        grade chargeable area 3 that is proposed would total approximately 195,454-sq. ft. of
        office space and 10,595-sq. ft. of shared amenity space; proposed non-chargeable area
        would total approximately 7,595-sq. ft. of retail and lobby space, and 258,761-sq. ft. of
        residential space (consisting of 384 units),

        Parking

        Parking for an estimated 270 vehicles would be provided in a five-level below grade
        parking garage. Vehicle ingress and egress would be from the west side of the
        proposed building from the alley.

        Project Design

        The proposed project would consist of an abstract Z-shaped, 38-story building. The
        building would appear as one distinct rectangle form at the base that includes the retail
        and office levels. The residential and observatory levels would rise out of that rectangle
        base as a 10-sided rectilinear tower to create an abstract Z-form. The 12th floor, where
        the two distinct shapes of the building meet, would be for shared amenities such as an
        office fitness center and residential decks. There would be four pedestrian entry points to
        the building. The residential entry point would be located at the mid-point of the building
        along Lenora Street, retail entrances would be located at either end of the building along
        3rd Avenue, and the office entrance would be located near the mid-point of the building
        along 3rd Avenue. Vehicular access would be from the alley to the west of the site. The
        proposed Z-form design is intended to allow for stepped facades, to create a strong
        visual connection between the entry and amenity spaces, and to allow for more units
        with desirable views of the city. Due to site topography, the building would step down
        slightly to the north. A rooftop conservatory would provide residential amenities for
        building tenants.

        The side of the proposed structure along Lenora Street would be approximately 106 ft.
        long, and the length of the proposed structure along 3rd Avenue would be approximately
        180 ft. Project features intended to improve the pedestrian experience along 3rd Avenue
        and Lenora Street include: building façade transparency and articulation, overhead
        weather protection, improved safety through minimizing and remediating existing curb
        cuts, and the provision of street-level open space.




3   Non-chargeable gross floor area is based on the Seattle Land Use Code and it excludes below-grade
    development, residential development, and street-level retail space. Retail space that is located above street-
    level is chargeable.

       Proposed Design Departures

       According to the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.41.012, new developments may be
       permitted to depart from Land Use Code requirements “if an applicant demonstrates that
       departures…would result in a development that better meets the intent of the adopted
       design guidelines.” The following text summarizes the proposed design departures for
       the 3rd & Lenora project.

       Street Level Use Requirements (SMC 23.49.009b) state that 50 percent of street
       frontage along the proposed building must be street-level uses. To clearly delineate
       between office and residential entrances, and allow for 3rd Avenue to have a continuous
       commercial use, there is a proposed departure of 33 percent street-level uses along
       Lenora Street. Other departures from the parking, height, façade modulation, and tower
       width municipal codes.

       If parking is provided in a DMC zone, SMC 23.54.030B.1.b states that there is a 60
       percent minimum of medium stalls for residential uses with five or more stalls. The
       requested departure is to allow for 45 percent medium stalls to allow for the most
       efficient configuration of parking, and because as a mixed-use building there would be a
       total of more than 60 percent medium stalls when including non-residential parking
       levels. Similarly, when providing non-residential use parking in a DMC zone with 20 or
       more spaces, SMC 23.54.030B.2.c states that there should be a 35 percent small stall
       minimum, with a 65 percent maximum and a 35 percent minimum of large stalls. The
       proposed departure is to allow for 18 percent of non-residential parking stalls to be large
       and 82 percent to be small and medium to allow for an optimized stall configuration for
       the highest possible quantity of large and medium stalls.

       There is also a proposed departure to increase the bonus height for enclosed areas from
       9,000-sq. ft. (SMC 23.49.008.B) to 14,100-sq. ft., as the enclosed space at the top of the
       proposed building would provide an unique, transparent city feature with varying
       elevations and visible trees and landscaping.

       Another departure request includes there be no limit to the length of unmodulated façade
       up to 160 ft. This is a proposed departure as the building set back of 3 ft. from the
       property line at the first two stories is believed to provide a more generous sidewalk
       width and vertical modulation at the street scale. Further, the building is set back more
       than 15 ft. from the lot line, and exceeds modulation requirements above the elevation of
       146 ft. where there is a natural break from office to residential uses, expressed in the
       building massing modulation. The final departure requests there be no limit to maximum
       façade width along the alley (SMC 23.49.058.E).


       Site Modification

       Construction of the 3rd & Lenora site would entail the demolition of all three existing
       buildings on the site. Excavation associated with the construction activities for the
       Proposed Action would result in the removal of approximately 45,000 cubic yards (cy) of
       soils, and would require approximately 1,500 cy of fill. The total affected area would be
       the entire project site, an estimated 19,440-sq. ft.

Environmental Checklist                                                                        12

12.    Location of the proposal. Give sufficient information for a person
       to understand the precise location of your proposed project,
       including a street address, if any. If a proposal would occur over
       a range of area, provide the range or boundaries of the site(s).

       The project site is located on a half-block within the Belltown Urban Center Village (see
       Figures 1 and 2). The half-block project area consists of approximately 19,440-sq. ft.
       The project site is bounded by 3rd Avenue to the east, an under-construction residential
       building to the south, a mid-block alley to the west, and Lenora Street to the north.

       The legal description of the project site is attached to the plans that are on-file with the
       City of Seattle (MUP No. 3018686).

B. ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS
1. Earth
   a. General description of the site (circle one):
      Flat, rolling, hilly, steep slopes, mountainous, other:

       The site slopes down approximately 5.6 feet from 3rd Avenue to the
       public alley.

   b. What is the steepest slope on the site (approximate percent
      slope)?

       The steepest slope on the site is approximately 5.2 percent from east
       to west.

   c. What general types of soils are found on the site (for example,
      clay, sand, gravel, peat, muck)? If you know the classification of
      agricultural soils, specify them and note any agricultural land of
      long-term commercial significance and whether the proposal
      results in removing any of these soils.

       A geotechnical study is currently being conducted at the proposed
       site. The geotechnical report, when completed, will identify the
       proposed site’s soil classifications, groundwater elevations, geologic
       hazards, and other similar geotechnical topics. When completed, the
       report will be submitted in full to the City of Seattle.

   d. Are there surface indications or history of unstable soils in the
      immediate vicinity? If so, describe.

       As noted above, a geotechnical study of the proposed site is
       underway, and the report, when completed, will address this question.

   e. Describe the purpose, type, and approximate quantities and total
      affected area of any filling, excavation, and grading proposed.
      Indicate source of fill.

       It is estimated that excavation for the Proposed Action would result in
       the removal of approximately 45,000 cubic yards (cy) of soils as part
       of construction activities on the site. Approximately 1,500 cy of fill
       would be required. The total affected area would be the entire project
       site, which is an estimated 19,440-sq. ft.

              ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


   f.   Could erosion occur as a result of clearing, construction, or use?
        If so, generally describe.

        Erosion is possible in conjunction with any construction activity. Site
        work would expose soils, but the implementation of a Temporary
        Erosion Sedimentation Control (TESC) plan would mitigate potential
        impacts. Once the buildings are operational, no erosion is anticipated.
        Although, as noted above, a geotechnical study has begun at the
        proposed site, and it will investigate geologic hazards such as erosion
        and, as appropriate, recommend mitigation.

   g. About what percent of the site will be covered with impervious
      surfaces after project construction (for example, asphalt or
      buildings)?

        Approximately 100 percent of the site would be covered with
        impervious surfaces after project construction, the same as under
        existing conditions.

   h. Proposed measures to reduce or control erosion, or other
      impacts to the earth, if any:

        Comprehensive Drainage Control Plan approvals (including
        Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs), Erosion and
        Sediment Control approvals) would be submitted as an element of the
        Building Permits.

2. Air
   a. What type of emissions to the air would result from the proposal
      (i.e., dust, automobile, odors, industrial wood smoke) during
      construction and when the project is completed? If any,
      generally describe and give approximate quantities if known.

        The Proposed Action could result in localized increases in air
        emissions (primarily carbon monoxide) and dust during construction
        activities, and some very minor increases in vehicular traffic during
        operation of the proposed development.

        In terms of greenhouse gases, the scale of global climate change is
        so large that a project’s impacts can only be evaluated on a
        cumulative scale and it is not anticipated that a single development
        project, particularly one of the limited size of the proposed project,
        even in combination with other area projects, would cause an
        individually discernible impact on global climate change.

        In order to evaluate the climate change impacts of the proposed
        project, a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Worksheet has been prepared

                ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


        to estimate the emissions footprint for the lifecycle of the development
        on a gross-level basis. The emissions estimate is based on the
        combined emissions from the following sources:

            •   Embodied Emissions – extraction, processing, transportation,
                construction and disposal of materials and landscape
                disturbance;
            •   Energy-related Emissions – energy demands created by the
                development after it is completed; and,
            •   Transportation-related Emissions – transportation demands
                created by the development after it is completed.

        The Worksheet estimate is based on building square footage. In total,
        the estimated lifespan emissions estimate for the project is
                                       4
        approximately 697,018 MTCO2e. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions
        Worksheet used to estimate the project emissions is contained in
        Appendix A of this Checklist.

        The proposed project has been designed to conform to the applicable
        regulations and standards of agencies regulating air quality in Seattle.
        These include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
        Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), and the Puget
        Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA).

    b. Are there any off-site sources of emissions or odor that may
       affect your proposal? If so, generally describe.

        No off-site sources of emissions or odors that may affect the proposed
        project have been identified.

    c. Proposed measures to reduce or control emissions or other
       impacts to air, if any:

        The following measures could be implemented to control emissions
        and/or dust during construction:

            •   During construction, sprinkling debris and exposed areas, as
                necessary, to control dust; and covering truck loads to
                minimize dust-related impacts.
            •   Using well-maintained equipment would reduce emissions
                from construction equipment and construction-related trucks
                as would avoiding prolonged periods of vehicle idling.

    MTCO2e is defined as Metric Ton Carbon Dioxide Equivalent; equates to 2204.62 pounds of CO2. This is a
    standard measure of amount of CO2 emissions reduced or sequestered. Carbon is not the same as Carbon
    Dioxide. Sequestering 3.67 tons of CO2 is equivalent to sequester one ton of carbon.

          •   Using electrically-operated small tools in place of gas-powered
              small tools, wherever feasible.
          •   Scheduling and coordinating trucking building materials to and
              from the project site to minimize congestion during peak travel
              times associated with adjacent roadways.

3. Water
   a. Surface:
      1) Is there any surface water body on or in the immediate
         vicinity of the site (including year-round and seasonal
         streams, saltwater, lakes, ponds, wetlands)? If yes, describe
         type and provide names. If appropriate, state what stream or
         river it flows into.

          The nearest water body is Elliot Bay, located approximately 0.3
          mile southwest of the site.

       2) Will the project require any work over, in, or adjacent to
          (within 200 feet) the described waters? If yes, please
          describe and attach available plans.

          No. The project would not require any work over, in or adjacent to
          Puget Sound.

       3) Estimate the amount of fill and dredge material that would be
          placed in or removed from surface water or wetlands and
          indicate the area of the site that would be affected. Indicate
          the source of fill material.

          No fill or dredge material would be placed in or removed from any
          surface water body as a result of this proposed project.

       4) Will the proposal require surface water withdrawals or
          diversions? Give general description, purpose, and
          approximate quantities if known.

          No. The Proposed Action would not require any surface water
          withdrawals or diversions.

       5) Does the proposal lie within a 100-year floodplain? If so, note
          location on the site plan.

          No, the site does not lie within a 100-year floodplain and is not
          identified as a flood-prone area on the City of Seattle critical areas
          map.

             ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


       6) Does the proposal involve any discharges of waste materials
          to surface waters? If so, describe the type of waste and
          anticipated volume of discharge.

          No. There would be no discharge of waste materials to surface
          waters.

   b. Ground:
      1) Will groundwater be withdrawn from a well for drinking water
         or other purposes? If so, give a general description of the
         well, proposed uses and approximate quantities withdrawn
         from the well. Will water be discharged to groundwater? Give
         general description, purpose, and approximate quantities if
         known.

          Construction dewatering could be required and would be based on
          the results of the before-mentioned, ongoing geotechnical study.
          A final dewatering methodology and permanent and specific long-
          term groundwater management provisions would be determined
          during later design phases.

       2) Describe waste material that will be discharged into the
          ground from septic tanks or other sources, if any (for
          example: domestic sewage; industrial, containing the
          following chemicals; agricultural; etc.). Describe the general
          size of the system, the number of such systems, the number
          of houses to be served (if applicable), or the number of
          animals or humans the system(s) are expected to serve.

          Waste material would not be discharged into the ground from
          septic tanks or other sources.

   c. Water Runoff (including storm water):
      1) Describe the source of runoff (including storm water) and
         method of collection and disposal, if any (include quantities,
         if known). Where will this water flow? Will this water flow
         into other waters? If so, describe.

          Impervious surfaces on the site are and would continue to be the
          source of runoff from the proposed project.

          On-site stormwater would be managed through an on-site
          stormwater detention vault, which would be sized and designed to
          release stormwater in conformance with the Peak Flow Control
          requirement as outlined by the City of Seattle Stormwater Manual.
          The project would also analyze the management of impervious

          surfaces using green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) to the
          maximum extent feasible (MEF); however, due to the type of
          project, the number of practical GSI BMPs is anticipated to be
          minimal. The project would be designed to meet all City of Seattle
          stormwater drainage requirements.

       2) Could waste materials enter ground or surface waters? If so,
          generally describe.

          No. The proposed stormwater collection system and associated
          mitigation measures would prevent waste materials from entering
          the groundwater or surface waters. All applicable City of Seattle
          stormwater control regulations would be followed during
          construction and operation of the project.

       3) Does the proposal alter or otherwise affect drainage patterns
          in the vicinity of the site? If so, describe.

         No, the proposal would not alter or otherwise affect drainage
         patterns in the site vicinity.

   d. Proposed measures to reduce or control surface, ground, and
      runoff water impacts, if any:

       The Proposed Action would comply with applicable requirements
       relating to surface water runoff control and water quality, including the
       City’s Drainage Control Ordinance.

       GSI would be implemented to the MEF per Seattle drainage
       requirements. Possible GSI measures include vegetated roofs that
       could include trees, and dispersion landscape strips.

       The proposed project would also require City approval of a
       Comprehensive Drainage Control Plan (including Construction BMPs,
       Erosion and Sediment Control approvals) as part of the building
       permit process.

4. Plants
   a. Check or circle types of vegetation found on the site:

       __ deciduous tree: alder, maple, aspen, birch, cherry, fig
       _X evergreen tree: fir, cedar, pine, other
       __ shrubs
       __ grass (in sidewalk planting areas)
       __ pasture
       __ crop or grain
       __ orchards, vineyards or other permanent crops

       __ wet soil plants: cattail, buttercup, bullrush, skunk cabbage, other
       __ water plants: water lily, eelgrass, milfoil, other
       __ Other types of vegetation

       There is no vegetation currently on the site. There are presently five
       street trees located immediately east of the site within the 3rd Avenue
       public right-of-way; there are no street trees within the Lenora Street
       public right-of-way immediately north of the site.

   b. What kind and amount of vegetation will be removed or altered?

       The site is currently 100 percent impervious surfaces, therefore there
       would be no on-site vegetation removed or altered. The five street
       trees located immediately adjacent to the site would be removed to
       accommodate construction activities and would be replaced
       consistent with City of Seattle requirements.

   c. List threatened or endangered species known to be on or near
      the site.

       No known threatened or endangered plant species are located on or
       near the project site.

   d. Proposed landscaping, use of native plants, or other measures
      to preserve or enhance vegetation on the site, if any:

       On the ground level, the proposed 3rd & Lenora project would
       include building setbacks to allow for new shrubs and groundcovers to
       be planted in expanded planting strips along all right-of-ways. New
       evergreen street trees would also be planted in the right-of-ways to
       replace any that were removed, resulting in a net increase of trees.
       There would also be a total of approximately 11,234-sq. ft. of shared
       amenity space on level 12. This space would be utilized by building
       tenants and would potentially include trees and other vegetation as
       well as indoor and outdoor deck space and outdoor patios. Level 37
       and 38 would also include residential amenities that may include
       indoor vegetation and recreational facilities.

   e. List all noxious weeds and invasive species known to be on or
      near the site.

       Noxious weeds known to be in the City of Seattle include giant
       hogweed (heracleum mantegazzianum) and English ivy.

      mammals: deer, bear, elk, beaver, other: rodents
      fish: bass, salmon, trout, herring, shellfish, other: None.

       Birds and small mammals tolerant of urban conditions may use and
       may be present on and near the site. Mammals likely to be present
       include: raccoon, eastern gray squirrel, mouse, rat, opossum, muskrat
       and feral cats.

       Birds common to the area include: European starling, house sparrow,
       rock dove, American crow, seagull, western gull, Canada goose,
       American robin, and house finch.

   b. List any threatened or endangered species known to be on or
      near the site.

       There are no threatened or endangered species known to be on or
       near the site.

   c. Is the site part of a migration route? If so, explain.

       The proposed site, as well as the entire City of Seattle, is within the
       Pacific Flyway migration route. No specific impacts are anticipated
       from the Proposed Action, and therefore no mitigation measures are
       necessary.

   d. Proposed measures to preserve or enhance wildlife, if any:

       No specific measures are proposed to preserve or enhance wildlife
       and/or habitat.

   e. List any invasive animal species known to be on or near the site.

       Invasive species known to be located in King County include
       European starling, house sparrow and eastern gray squirrel.

6. Energy and Natural Resources

   a. What kinds of energy (electric, natural gas, oil, wood stove,
      solar) will be used to meet the completed project’s energy
      needs?      Describe whether it will be used for heating,
      manufacturing, etc.

       Electricity and natural gas are the primary sources of energy that
       would serve the proposed development. During operation, these
       energy sources would be used for project heating, cooling, hot water,
       and lighting.

   b. Would your project affect the potential use of solar energy by
      adjacent properties? If so, generally describe.

       No. The Proposed Action is not expected to affect solar energy
       access associated with adjacent properties. There will be additional
       shadows for short periods of the day over adjacent buildings, although
       these are not expected to affect their overall solar energy access.

   d. What kinds of energy conservation features are included in the
      plans of this proposal? List other proposed measures to reduce
      or control energy impacts, if any:

       The proposed development has been designed to exceed the
       requirements of the 2012 Seattle Energy Code by 10 percent. Project
       materials would contain low or no VOCs, and have a high percentage
       of recycled materials. The proposed building would also utilize low
       energy LED lighting and low flow plumbing fixtures.

7. Environmental Health
   a. Are there any environmental health hazards, including exposure
      to toxic chemicals, risk of fire and explosion, spill, or hazardous
      waste that could occur as a result of this proposal? If so,
      describe.

       No environmental health hazards are expected to occur as a result of
       the proposed project.

       1) Describe any known or possible contamination at the site
          from present or past uses.

          Regulated Building Material Surveys would be completed for all of
          the existing buildings on-site to identify possible asbestos-

             ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


          containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paints, and universal
          waste. If any such materials are identified, they would be
          removed and remediated in accordance with applicable
          regulations.

       2) Describe existing hazardous chemicals/conditions that might
          affect project development and design. This includes
          underground hazardous liquid and gas transmission
          pipelines located within the project area and in the vicinity.

          No hazardous chemicals/conditions are anticipated to affect
          project development or design.

       3) Describe any toxic or hazardous chemicals that might be
          stored, used, or produced during the project’s development
          or construction, or at any time during the operating life of the
          project.

          No toxic or hazardous chemicals are anticipated to be stored,
          used or produced during the project’s development, construction
          or operation.

       4) Describe special emergency services that might be required.

          No special emergency services are anticipated to be required as a
          result of this Proposed Action. As is typical of urban development,
          it is possible that normal fire, medical, and other emergency
          services may be needed on occasion from the City of Seattle.

       5) Proposed measures to reduce or control environmental
          health hazards, if any:

          No environmental health hazards are anticipated and no
          measures to reduce or control hazards are proposed.

   b. Noise
      1) What types of noise exist in the area that may affect your
         project (for example: traffic, equipment operation, other)?

          Vehicular traffic noise associated with adjacent streets (e.g., 3rd
          Avenue and Lenora Street), and temporary construction noise
          from nearby projects can be relatively high at certain times of day.
          Vehicular traffic and temporary construction noise is not expected
          to adversely affect the Proposed Action.

3rd & Lenora
              ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


       2) What types and levels of noise would be created by or
          associated with the project on a short-term or a long-term
          basis (for example: traffic, construction, operation, other)?
          Indicate what hours noise would come from site.

          Construction-related noise would occur as a result of on-site
          construction activities associated with the Proposed Action.
          Construction noise would be short-term and would be the most
          noticeable noise generated by the proposed project. This includes
          construction activity on-site, at associated off-site construction
          staging areas, and noise associated with construction-related
          traffic. The Proposed Action would comply with provisions of
          Seattle’s Noise Code (SMC, Chapter 25.08); no noise variances
          are anticipated.

          Once the project is operational, no significant long-term noise
          impacts are anticipated; the development would comply with
          provisions of the City of Seattle’s Noise Code. Indirect noise
          impacts from the Proposed Action may include increased traffic-
          related noise associated with vehicles operating in and around the
          development.

       3) Proposed measures to reduce or control noise impacts, if
          any:

          As noted above, the project would comply with provisions of the
          City’s Noise Ordinance; specifically: construction hours would be
          limited to weekdays (non-holiday) from 7 AM to 10 PM and
          Saturdays and Sundays from 9 AM to 10 PM. If extended
          construction hours are necessary, the applicant would seek
          approval from DPD in advance. However, the need for extended
          construction hours is not anticipated.

8. Land and Shoreline Use
   a. What is the current use of the site and adjacent properties? Will
      the proposal affect current land uses on nearby or adjacent
      properties? If so, describe.

       The project site is currently occupied by three low-rise commercial
       and office buildings. Surrounding land uses include:

          •   North – Surface parking and low-rise retail buildings across
              Lenora Avenue;
          •   East – Mid-rise mixed-use buildings (including office,
              residential, retail, and YWCA uses) across 3rd Avenue;

3rd & Lenora
               ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


           •   South – Low-rise retail, mid-rise residential, and surface and
               garage parking; and,
           •   West – Mid-rise residential and low-rise commercial, across
               alley.

   b. Has the site been used as working farmlands or working forest
      lands? If so, describe. How much agricultural or forest land of
      long-term commercial significance will be converted to other
      uses as a result of the proposal, if any? If resource lands have
      not been designated, how many acres in farmland or forest land
      tax status will be converted to nonfarm or nonforest use?

        No, the site has not been used as working farmlands or forest lands
        for over 100 years.

        1) Will the proposal affect or be affected by surrounding working
           farm or forest land normal business operations, such as
           oversize equipment access, the application of pesticides,
           tilling, and harvesting? If so, how:

          No. The site is located in an urban area and would not affect or be
          affected by working farm or forest land; no working farm or forest
          land is located in the vicinity of this urban site.

   c. Describe any structures on the site.

        The project site contains three low-rise buildings, all of which are used
        for retail, as detailed below:

           •   A two-story, approximately 18,360-sq. ft. office, built in 1919;
           •   An one-story, approximately 5,040-sq. ft. office, built in 1923;
               and,
           •   A two-story, approximately 14,900-sq. ft. office, built in 1918.

   d. Will any structures be demolished? If so, what?

        The proposed development would require demolition of all three
        buildings that presently occupy the site.

   e.   What is the current zoning classification of the site?

        The project site is zoned Downtown Mixed Commercial (DMC
        240/290-400).

3rd & Lenora
                   ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


   f.       What is the current comprehensive plan designation of the site?

            The site is located within the Belltown Urban Center Village, which is
            one of the City of Seattle’s six designated Urban Centers. The Future
            Land Use Map in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan identifies the site
            as a Downtown Area.

   g. If applicable, what is the current shoreline master program
      designation of the site?

            The project site is not located within a shoreline master program area.

   h. Has any part of the site been classified as a critical area by the
      city of county? If so, specify.

            No part of the site has been classified as a critical area by the city or
            county.

   i.       Approximately how many people would reside or work in the
            completed project?

            At full occupancy, the 3rd & Lenora space could house up to
            approximately 735 employees and 719 residents, as detailed below:

                                                       Square                Total

   j.       Approximately how many people would the completed project
            displace?

            No residential uses are currently located on the site; therefore, the
            Proposed Action would not displace any residents.            Existing
            businesses and associated employees located on the 3rd & Lenora
            site are currently leasing space from the property owner and would
            relocate prior to construction.

   k. Proposed measures to avoid or reduce displacement impacts, if
      any:

            No displacement impacts would occur, and no mitigation measures
            are necessary.

              ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


   l.   Proposed measures to ensure the proposal is compatible with
        existing and projected land uses and plans, if any:

        The project site is located in the Belltown Urban Center Village, which
        is one of the City of Seattle’s six designated Urban Centers. Urban
        Centers are intended to provide mixed-use neighborhoods with
        concentrations of employment and housing, with direct access to
        high-capacity transit and a wide range of supportive land uses
        including retail, recreation, public facilities, parks, and open space.
        The Future Land Use Map in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan
        identifies the site as a Downtown Area.

        The proposed 3rd & Lenora project would promote increased land
        use density (office and residential) on a site that is currently under-
        developed from a land use perspective. Consistent with the goals and
        policies identified for Urban Centers, the concept for the 3rd &
        Lenora project would provide retail, office, and residential uses on-
        site in a compact pattern. The project would also concentrate office
        and residential growth in a location with access to major bus routes,
        as well as convenient access to residences in Belltown and other
        nearby neighborhoods, such as Downtown, Queen Anne, South Lake
        Union, and the Denny Triangle.

        The project would involve development of a site to use the limited land
        resources in Urban Centers more efficiently.           The proposed
        development would consume less land than lower density
        development would, and, as such, could be viewed as being more
        efficient from a land use perspective. The proposed development
        would also be consistent with the type and scale of existing land uses
        surrounding the site within the Belltown Urban Center Village.

    m. Proposed measures to ensure the proposal is compatible with
       nearby agricultural and forest lands of long-term commercial
       significance, if any:

        The project site is not located near agricultural or forest lands. As
        previously noted, the site is located in the Belltown area of Seattle.
        Therefore, no mitigation measures would be necessary.

9. Housing
   a. Approximately how many units would be provided, if any?
      Indicate whether high, middle, or low-income housing.

        The proposed 3rd & Lenora project would include 384 housing units.

              ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


   b. Approximately how many units, if any, would be eliminated?
      Indicate whether high, middle, or low-income housing.

        No housing presently exists on-site, and none would be eliminated.

   c. Proposed measures to reduce or control housing impacts, if any:

        No housing impacts would occur and no mitigation would be
        necessary.

10. Aesthetics
   a. What is the tallest height of any proposed structure(s), not
      including antennas; what is the principal exterior building
      material(s) proposed?

        The tallest height of the proposed 3rd & Lenora building would be
        440 ft. including the rooftop recreational amenity and building
        mechanical.

   b. What views in the immediate vicinity would be altered or
      obstructed?

        The existing site uses would be replaced with a new, high-rise, 38-
        story office and residential building. Therefore, views of the project
        site would change from three smaller, low-rise buildings, to a modern,
        high-rise development that would occupy the majority of the site, with
        parking located below-grade.           From nearby locations, existing
        background views (i.e., views of buildings beyond the site) could be
        obstructed by the Proposed Action. (See Figure 8 for a view of the
        proposed project as seen from the Volunteer Park Water Tower, and
        Figure 9 for a view of the proposed project as seen from Kerry Park).
        However, the proposed building height would comply with the City’s
        Land Use Code requirements, and landscaping and open space
        would be provided to improve the aesthetic character of the site. The
        project site is not located within a view corridor.

   c.   Proposed measures to reduce or control aesthetic impacts, if
        any:

        No significant aesthetic impacts are anticipated with the Proposed
        Action; therefore, no mitigation measures are proposed.

11. Light and Glare
    a. What type of light or glare will the proposal produce? What time
       of day would it mainly occur?

        At times during the construction process, area lighting of the job site
        (to meet safety requirements) may be provided, which would be
        noticeable proximate to the project site. When the project is
        operational, stationary sources of light would include interior lighting,
        building lighting, and security lighting. Sources of glare would include
        the mirrored and glazed building facade materials (see Appendix B
        for further details). A solar glare analysis has been completed for the
        3rd & Lenora project (Appendix B) and that analysis indicates that
        while northbound and southbound traffic on 3rd Avenue could
        occasionally experience reflected solar glare from the façade of the
        proposed building, such glare, while noticeable, would for the most
        part be outside the cone-of-influence and would not be expected to
        cause problems for motorists, nor differ substantially from periodic
        glare from stationary and mobile sources that motorists typically
        experience.

        Shadows

        Seattle’s SEPA policies aim to “minimize or prevent light blockage and
        the creation of shadows on open spaces most used by the public.” 5
        Policy background, however, indicates that due to the scale of
        development that is permitted Downtown, it is not practical to prevent
        shadow impacts at all public open spaces in Downtown.               In
        Downtown, areas where shadow impacts may be mitigated are:

        •   Freeway Park;
        •   Westlake Park and Plaza;
        •   Market (Steinbrueck) Park;
        •   Convention Center Park; and
        •   Kobe Terrace Park.

        None of the parks listed above are near enough to the project site to
        be affected by the proposed building’s shadows. The nearest public
        open space to the project site is Regrade Park, located approximately
        two blocks north of the proposed site. McGraw Square and Westlake
        Square are also located nearby, approximately four blocks to the
        south and east.

3rd & Lenora
                ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


        Factors that influence the extent of shading include: weather (e.g.,
        cloud cover); building height, width and facade orientation; and the
        proximity of other intervening structures, topographic variations and
        significant landscaping. Generally speaking, greater building heights
        extend the length of the shadow cast, and increased mass (or cross-
        sectional width) widens the shadow cast by a building. The shadows
        of tall buildings extend farther from a building, but their effects on
        more distant locations are of shorter duration, because the sun’s
        motion translates into faster movement of the shadow over the
        ground. Buildings with greater mass, create wider shadows and an
        increased amount of shaded area on the immediately adjacent streets
        and public spaces, but the reach of the shadow would be limited by
        the building’s height.

        Because of the building’s location relative to the closest parks, no
        shadow impacts are anticipated to occur to any of the parks listed on
        the previous page. See Figure 10 for a diagram showing shadows
        cast for various times of the day on key days of the solar year. These
        key days of the solar year and times of the day depict worst-case
        conditions. Shadow-related impacts, however, can also occur at other
        times of the day throughout the year. Because of the earth’s rotation,
        the duration of shadow-related impacts varies for a stationary
        observer 6 based on season and depending upon the width of the
        shadow. As shown in Figure 11, neither the length nor the direction
        of the shadows would reach the parks where shadow mitigation is
        required (including Westlake Park), and no shadow impacts would be
        anticipated.

    b. Could light or glare from the finished project be a safety hazard
       or interfere with views?

        No. Light and glare associated with the Proposed Action is not
        expected to cause a safety hazard, nor interfere with views. (See
        Appendix B for more information.)

    c. What existing off-site sources of light or glare may affect your
       proposal?

        There are no off-site sources of light or glare that would affect the
        Proposed Action.




6   The rate of change of the sun’s angle relative to the earth varies widely by season – from about 5 degrees

   d. Proposed measures to reduce or control light and glare impacts,
      if any:

       No significant long term, reflected solar glare-related environmental
       impacts are anticipated for motorists on 2nd or 3rd Avenues as a result
       of the proposed 3rd & Lenora project, and no mitigation measures
       are necessary. The following measures, however, would help to
       reduce overall light and glare from the project as it relates to the
       neighborhood surrounding the site. (See Appendix B for more
       information.)

       •   While building façade materials are in the process of being
           finalized, the facades of the proposed building could include metal
           and glass window wall structure with glass spandrel panels. The
           City’s Downtown Design Review Board is currently reviewing
           project-related design elements. Reflectivity of the glazing will be
           dictated by the nature of glass that is employed and the
           requirements set forth by the City's Energy Code. It is anticipated,
           however, that no excessively-reflective surfaces (i.e. mirrored
           glass, or polished metals) that go beyond what is required to meet
           energy-related code provisions will be proposed anywhere on the
           exterior of the project buildings.
       •   Building façade modulation is proposed for the 3rd & Lenora
           project, which would reduce the effect of any potential reflected
           solar glare.
       •   The proposed street trees, as well as the use of building materials
           with relatively low-reflectivity at street-level, would minimize
           reflective glare-related impacts to pedestrians, motorists and
           nearby residents.
       •   Pedestrian-scale lighting would be provided consistent with code,
           function and safety requirements. Exterior lighting would include
           fixtures to direct the light downward and/or upward and away from
           off-site land uses.

12. Recreation
   a. What designated and informal recreational opportunities are in
      the immediate vicinity?

       Regrade Park and McGraw Square are located approximately two
       blocks northwest and east of the site, respectively. Westlake Park
       and Victor Steinbrueck Park are located approximately 0.3 mile
       southeast and south of the site, respectively.

   b. Would the proposed project displace any existing recreational
      uses? If so, describe.

       No. The Proposed Action would not displace any existing recreational
       uses.

   c. Proposed measures to reduce or control impacts on recreation,
      including recreation opportunities to be provided by the project
      or applicant, if any:

       No impacts to existing recreation facilities or opportunities are
       anticipated, and no mitigation is proposed.

13. Historic and Cultural Preservation
   a. Are there any buildings, structures, or sites, located on or near the
      site that are over 45 years old listed in or eligible for listing in
      national, state, or local preservation registers located on or near
      the site? If so, specifically describe.

       As part of the Proposed Action, a MUP Appendix A-Historic
       Resources Letter was prepared by The Johnson Partnership (see
       Appendix C of this Checklist). As indicated in Section A, the 3rd &
       Lenora site contains three buildings. None of the three buildings
       would require review by the City of Seattle Department of
       Neighborhoods’ Historic Preservation Program during the SEPA
       process related to any redevelopment of the properties. Appendix C
       findings related to these existing buildings include:

           •   The Jewish Federation Building is a Category 4 property
               within the “2007 Downtown Historic Resources Survey and
               Inventory.”
           •   The Pathé Building was nominated by the Landmarks
               Preservation Board as a City of Seattle Landmark in 2013,
               and the Board chose not to designate the building as a
               landmark in a 2014 public hearing.

3rd & Lenora
                ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


            •   The 2019 3rd Avenue building is a Category 4 property within
                the “2007 Downtown Historic Resources Survey and
                Inventory.”

       Category 4 properties, such as the Jewish Federation Building and
       the 2019 3rd Avenue building, are those that have been so altered
       over the years that they do not qualify as Seattle landmarks. They are
       determined as not eligible and no landmark nomination is required
       during the SEPA process for any redevelopment.

       As the Landmark Preservation Board failed to designate the Pathé
       Building as a landmark during a public hearing on January 15, 2014,
       no new nominations of the site can be commenced within five years of
       that date without the written consent of the owner.

       Outside of the proposed site there is one nearby building that has
       been listed on the Washington Heritage Register and National
       Register since April of 2014. The beaux arts Calhoun Hotel is located
       at 2000 2nd Avenue, approximately 0.1 miles away from the Proposed
       Action, and was built in 1910.

       Please see Appendix C of this Checklist for further information
       concerning historic and cultural preservation at the proposed site.

   b. Are there any landmarks, features, or other evidence of Indian or
      historic use or occupation? This may include human burials or
      old cemeteries. Are there any material evidence, artifacts, or
      areas of cultural importance on or near the site? Please list any
      professional studies conducted at the site to identify such
      resources.

       There are no known landmarks, features, or other evidence of Indian
       or historic use or occupation of the project site.

   c. Describe the methods used to assess the potential impacts to
      cultural and historic resources on or near the project site.
      Examples include consultation with tribes and the department of
      archeology and historic preservation, archaeological surveys,
      historic maps, GIS data, etc.

       Potential impacts to historic resources on or near the site were
       evaluated by consulting with The Johnson Partnership (see Appendix
       C for details).

   d. Proposed measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for loss,
      changes to, and disturbance to resources. Please include plans
      for the above and any permits that may be required.

       No loss, changes to, or disturbance of historic or cultural resources
       are anticipated to occur, and no mitigation measures are proposed.

       In the unlikely event that ground-disturbing or other activities were to
       result in the inadvertent discovery of archaeological deposits, work
       would be halted in the immediate area and contact made with the
       State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. Work
       would be halted until such time as further investigation and
       appropriate consultation were concluded.

14. Transportation
   a. Identify public streets and highways serving the site or affected
      geographic area and describe the proposed access to the
      existing street system. Show on site plans, if any.

       The project site is served by 3rd Avenue and Lenora Street (see
       Figures 2 and 3). Vehicular access to the site is proposed via the
       alley between 3rd Avenue and 2nd Avenue, on the east side of the
       proposed building. The alley extends to the east off of Lenora Street
       to Virginia Street. Alley access would provide one driveway to the
       proposed underground parking garage and access to the delivery
       area. (See Appendix D for further transportation-related information.)

   b. Is site or affected geographic area currently served by public
      transit? If not, what is the approximate distance to the nearest
      transit stop?

       Yes, the site is currently served by public transit. Bus transit service in
       the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit along 2nd and
       3rd Avenues, as well as Lenora Street.

       Transit service is accessed via bus stops that are located northeast of
       the project site on 3rd Avenue, one block north of the project site on
       Lenora Street, and southwest of the project site on 2nd Avenue. (See
       Appendix D for further transportation-related information.)

   c. How many additional parking spaces would the completed project
       have? How many would the project or proposal eliminate?

       The proposed 3rd & Lenora project would include 270 parking
       spaces. There are no existing surface parking spaces that would be
       eliminated by the project. The existing buildings on the proposed site
       utilize on-street or other surface parking off site. The Transportation

Environmental Checklist                                                              38
3rd & Lenora
              ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


        Impact Analysis conducted by Transpo Group (Appendix D)
        estimates that the proposed building would create a peak parking
        demand of 265, including surplus residential parking spaces, and a 4-
        space parking deficit for office and retail uses. There are 13 on-street
        parking spots within an 800-ft. walking radius of the project site. It is
        estimated that these 13 spaces would accommodate the anticipated
        peak parking spillover. Although, as these spaces are 92 percent full
        currently, drivers may have to park further away or utilize transit (see
        Appendix D for more information).

   d. Will the proposal require any new or improvements to existing
      roads, streets, pedestrian, bicycle or state transportation
      facilities, not including driveways? If so, generally describe
      (indicate whether public or private).

        Sidewalk improvements would be required by SDOT under the Street
        Improvement Plan (SIP).

   e. Will the project or proposal use (or occur in the immediate
      vicinity of) water, rail, or air transportation? If so, generally
      describe.

        No. The project would not occur in the immediate vicinity of water, rail,
        or air transportation.

   f.   How many vehicular trips per day would be generated by the
        completed project or proposal? If known, indicate when peak
        volumes would occur and what percentage of the volume would
        be trucks (such as commercial and nonpassenger vehicles).
        What data or transportation models were used to make these
        estimates?

        Vehicular trip generation was estimated in the Transportation Impact
        Analysis (Transpo Group, 2015) and considered land uses, Institute of
        Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip rates, average vehicle occupancy
        as well as local mode splits (see Appendix D for more information).
        The proposed project would generate approximately 1,280 net new
        weekday vehicular trips per day with approximately 129 net new trips
        during the AM peak hour and 138 net new trips during the PM peak
        hour.

   g. Will the proposal interfere with, affect or be affected by the
      movement of agricultural and forest products on roads or streets
      in the area? If so, generally describe.

        No, the proposal would not interfere with, affect or be affected by the
        movement of agricultural and forest products on streets in the area.

               ENVIRONMENTAL (SEPA) CHECKLIST


   h. Proposed measures to reduce or control transportation impacts,
      if any.

       A Transportation Management Program (TMP) would be developed
       for the project, as required by City of Seattle Municipal Code. If
       necessary, additional mitigation measures would be defined through
       the Traffic Impact Study in coordination with the City staff.

15. Public Services
   a. Would the project result in an increased need for public services
      (for example: fire protection, police protection, health care,
      schools, other)? If so, generally describe.

       It is anticipated that the Proposed Action would generate an
       incremental need for increased public services due to the addition of
       employees, customers, and residents associated with the site. To the
       extent that emergency service providers have planned for gradual
       increases in service demands, no significant impacts are anticipated.

   b. Proposed measures to reduce or control direct impacts on public
      services, if any.

       While the potential increase in employees, customers, and residents
       associated with the Proposed Action may result in incrementally
       greater demand for emergency services, it is anticipated that
       adequate service capacity is available within the Belltown
       Neighborhood area to preclude the need for additional public
       facilities/services.

16. Utilities
   a. Circle utilities currently available at the site: electricity, natural
      gas, water, refuse service, telephone, sanitary sewer, septic
      system, other.

       All utilities are currently available to the site.

   b. Describe the utilities that are proposed for the project, the utility
      providing the service, and the general construction activities on
      the site or in immediate vicinity that might be needed.

       Utilities and providers (in parentheses) proposed for the project would
       include the following:

           •   Water – New domestic water connection and fire service
               connection (Seattle Public Utilities).
           •   Sewer – New side sewer connection to combined sewer
               system (Seattle Public Utilities).

Solar Glare Analysis

                                 SOLAR GLARE ANALYSIS

Approach

This glare analysis has been prepared consistent with provisions of Seattle’s Land Use Code
and acceptable methodology 1 for projects within the City. The methodology that has been used
involves a trigonometric/planimetric approach for determining reflected solar glare impacts. This
analysis primarily evaluates reflected solar glare impacts resulting from glazing on the façade of
the proposed building during four key periods of the year – vernal equinox (March 21st), summer
solstice (June 21st), autumnal equinox (September 21st), and winter solstice (December 21st).

The glare diagrams that are contained in this analysis include adjustments for:

    •   the gradients of 2nd and 3rd Avenues based on street profile information;
    •   adjacent buildings; and,
    •   daylight savings time, which affects vernal equinox, summer solstice and autumnal
        equinox.

Findings

Summary of Findings

The analysis indicates that while northbound and southbound traffic on 3rd Avenue could
occasionally experience reflected solar glare from the façade of the proposed building, while
noticeable, such glare for the most part would be outside the cone-of-influence and would not
be expected to cause problems for motorists nor differ substantially from periodic glare from
stationary and mobile sources that motorists typically experience.

Sources of Light and Glare

While the light from vehicle headlights and reflective solar glare from glazing and other specular
surfaces on vehicles can cause temporary glare impacts associated with a development project,
the principal source of glare associated with most development projects is sunlight reflected
from specular surfaces on building facades. Factors influencing the amount of reflective solar
glare that may occur include: weather (e.g., cloud cover); building height, width and orientation
of the façade; percent of the façade that is glazed or composed of specular material; reflectivity
of the glass or specular surfaces; design relationship between the glazed and non-glazed
portions of the façade (e.g., glass inset from the sash, horizontal and vertical modulation); the
color and texture of building materials that comprise the façade; and the proximity of other
intervening structures or landscaping.

Principal sources of light that presently occur proximate to the project site include streetlights
along 3rd Avenue and Lenora Street; light from headlights of vehicles operating on adjacent
streets and maneuvering on parking lots and within above-grade parking garages; and building
lighting (interior and in some instances low-level exterior) in the immediate area of the site.
