5th & Virginia                                                                         October 2016



                                    Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed use building located at 1933 5th Avenue in the
Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. As necessary, mitigation measures are identified that
would offset or reduce significant transportation related impacts that the proposed project
may have on the surrounding transportation system.

Project Description
As shown in Figure 1, the proposed project is located on the southwest corner of the 5th
Avenue/Virginia Street intersection in Seattle’s Belltown neighborhood. The proposed project
would develop up to 431 residential apartment units, 155 hotel dwelling units, and
approximately, 1,000 square feet of specialty retail, 10,500 square feet of restaurant uses
and 3,000 square feet of drinking establishment included as part of the hotel/restaurant uses.
The existing site uses which include approximately 22,700 square feet of office, 6,500 square
feet of restaurant, and 9,700 square feet of retail would be removed as part of the project.

Figure 2 illustrates the preliminary site plan. Up to 239 parking spaces within an underground
parking garage are proposed with access provided via the alley that extends between 4th
Avenue and 5th Avenue. All of the proposed parking would be valet with pick-up/drop-off for
hotel, restaurant, and retail guests proposed along the 5th Avenue frontage. Residential
users would drop-off/pick-off vehicles on level P1 of the parking garage, which is accessed
via the alley or the valet area along 5th Avenue. A reservoir of parking will be provided within
the garage to be used for valet operators. It is anticipated that the development would be
constructed and occupied by 2019.

The loading dock for the project is also located off the alley. Angled bases are provided,
requiring that trucks access the alley via the Stewart Street connection, exiting onto Virginia
Street.

Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with City of Seattle Department of Construction
and Inspections staff and is consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the area.
Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed projects, the following
intersections were evaluated for the weekday PM peak hour conditions:
    1. 4th Avenue/ Virginia Street                       5. 5th Avenue/Olive Way
    2. 4th Avenue/ Stewart Street                        6. 6th Avenue/Olive Way
    3. 5th Avenue/ Virginia Street                       7. 7th Avenue/Olive Way
    4. 5th Avenue/ Stewart Street
This report first describes existing and future (2019) without-project conditions in the vicinity
of the project site. This includes the street system, existing and future without-project
weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized
facilities, and transit service. Future (2019) with-project conditions are then described. The
project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation system were identified by comparing the
future with-project conditions to the future without-project conditions. In addition to the
standard elements required by the City of Seattle, an analysis of the future alley operations
was conducted and the results summarized herein. The alley intersections along Virginia
Street and Stewart Street were evaluated for existing, without-project, and with-project
conditions during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. Additionally, corridor operations
along Stewart Street and Olive Way were evaluated for existing, without-project, with-project
conditions. Consistent with alleys in the downtown core, there are a variety of uses in the



                                                                                                    1

alley to which this project proposes access to. These uses include loading dock access for
existing and proposed uses, garbage and recycling pick-up, move-in/move-out activity for
Escala, as well as parking garage access for the proposed use. The TIA also includes an
evaluation of the anticipated increase of traffic in the alley under cumulative conditions and
the impacts to the alley functionality.

     Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing (2015) and future (2019) without-project conditions within the
study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system, planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Existing and future
without-project conditions for the alley between 4th Avenue and 5th Avenue adjacent to the
proposed project site are described.

Street System
The following describes the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed project
and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.
Existing
Characteristics of the existing street system in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is in the immediate vicinity of three to
four lane arterials. In addition, Olive Way, Virginia Street, Stewart Street, 4th Avenue, 5th
Avenue, and 6th Avenue are all one-way streets.

Future
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) and WSDOT improvements, one transportation project that may impact the street
system and travel patterns in the study area was identified. The Center City Connector is a
proposed modern streetcar line that will link over a dozen Seattle neighborhoods, running
through downtown and connecting the South Lake Union and First Hill Streetcar lines. A
portion of the line will run on Stewart Street from 1st Avenue to 6th Avenue. The streetcar line
is projected to start operations in 2018/2019. Initial streetcar design concepts along Stewart
at 4th and 5th Avenues show the removal of on-street parking and no changes to general
purpose capacity at the study intersections with the exception of the 4th Avenue/Stewart
Street intersection. The current configuration at the 4th Avenue/Stewart Street intersection
allows vehicles to utilize the bus lane to make westbound right turn movements. It is
anticipated as part of the streetcar that the westbound right turn-lane would be removed. A
preliminary engineering and environmental assessment is currently being conducted for this
project and would identify any changes to the street system and associated impacts.

Traffic Volumes
The following summarize the traffic volumes for existing (2015) and future (2019) without-
project conditions.

Existing
Traffic counts were collected on various dates in 2015 for each study intersection. Figure 3
illustrates the existing (2015) weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study
intersections, rounded to the nearest 5 vehicles. Detailed traffic count worksheets are
provided in Appendix A.
Future
Future (2019) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 1.5 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes
at each study intersection. This growth rate is based on discussions with City staff and is
consistent with recent studies conducted in the area. Traffic from the following pipeline
projects in the project vicinity were also included in the future without-project volume
forecasts:
        2013 3rd Avenue: This project would develop 65 residential units and 1,000 square
         feet of commercial space.
        2000 3rd Avenue: This project would develop 431 residential units, 40 hotel dwelling
         units, and 5,100 square feet of retail.
        1903 5th Avenue: This project would develop 223 residential units, a 284-room
         hotel, and 2,070 square feet of retail.
        1931 2nd Avenue: This project would develop 225 residential units, a 150-room
         hotel, and 7,000 square feet of retail.
        2116 4th Avenue: This project would develop 339 residential units and a 142-room
         hotel with 1,824 square feet of support retail.
        2031 3rd Avenue: This project would develop 384 residential units, 196,000 square
         feet of office space, and 7,000 square feet of retail.
        2021 7th Avenue/ 2100 7th Avenue/ 2101 7th Avenue: This project would develop
         3 million+ square feet of office and 13,000 square feet of retail
        204 Pine Street: This project would develop 398 multifamily dwelling units with 4,300
         square feet of retail.

Future (2019) without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour
of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection. Traffic
operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service
(LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM Peak hour traffic operations for existing (2015) and future (2019) without-
project conditions were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures
identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010) and using the Synchro 9 software

program except for three intersections: Stewart Street/4th Avenue, Olive Way/6th Avenue,
and Olive Way/7th Avenue. The intersections were evaluated using HCM 2000 methodology
due to custom signal timing or exclusive pedestrian and hold phases. Pedestrian and bicycle
volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of the intersections.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2019) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized in Table
2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, all signalized intersections currently operate at LOS B during the
weekday PM peak hour. In 2019, with the anticipated growth in traffic, the intersections would
experience slight increases in delay over current levels but are anticipated to operate at LOS
C or better.

As discussed previously, initial streetcar design concepts along Stewart at 4th and 5th
Avenues show the removal of on-street parking and no changes to general purpose capacity
at the study intersections. With no changes in capacity, operations would likely be similar to
documented above with the streetcar. The City is conducting further engineering and
environmental studies, which will further define impacts to the street cross-section and
associated operational impacts.
Alley Operations
The existing two-way alley extends between Virginia and Stewart Streets and mainly provides
access for loading and deliveries for the adjacent buildings and access to the existing surface
lot located at the corner of Stewart Street and 5th Avenue. The alley currently has low
volumes with approximately 15 vehicles per hour during the weekday AM and PM peak hours
based on traffic counts collected in August 2015. Table 3 summarizes the weekday peak
hour operations of the alley.

As shown in Table 3, the alley at Virginia Street currently operates at LOS C during the AM
peak hour and LOS D during the PM peak hour. The alley at Stewart Street currently
operates at LOS D during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour. With future
increases in traffic by 2019 including the proposed Stanford Hotel at 1903 5th Avenue, the
alley access at Virginia Street would operate at LOS D during the weekday AM peak hour
and LOS E during the weekday PM peak hour. The Stewart Street alley access would
continue to operate at LOS D during the weekday AM peak hour and LOS E during the
weekday PM peak hour.

The operations of the Alley intersection at both Virginia and Stewart Street are impacted by
the operations of the downstream signalized intersections along both Virginia Street and
Stewart Street. An additional analysis using SimTraffic is being conducted to provide
additional analysis on the queuing on both streets and the potential impact to the alley
operations. Existing observations have noted queuing that extends past the alley
connections, but it clears out each cycle, allowing traffic to exit the alley at that time.

Observations regarding alley activity and blockages were conducted for one day in August
2015 and one day in May 2016 on a weekday for an 11-hour period each day to understand
current operations. Figure 5 provides a summary of the length of blockages per hour over the
two-day period and the number of observations.

                                             Length of Blockage per Hour


Observed blockages were due to loading and unloading activity in the alley. On average, over
the two-day period, the alley was blocked approximately 23 minutes with approximately 40
percent of the observations being 15-minutes or less. During the 11-hour per day observation
period, on average the alley was blocked 33 percent of the time or almost 4-hours per day.

A majority of the activity in the alley resulting in blockages is for short periods due to
deliveries and garbage pick-up. On the May 2016 observation day, the alley was blocked for



                                                                                                                     11

over 3-hours due to move-in activities related to the adjacent Escala building. This resulted in
the alley being blocked for approximately 40-percent of the observations period in May 2016
or over 4-hours. During the August observation period, the longest observed loading time
blocking the alley was approximately 24 minutes and was associated with the Icon Grill. In
August, the longest loading activity blocking the alley associated with the Escala building was
approximately 16 minutes. Approximately 20-25 percent of the observed alley activity was
related to the Escala building.

Under future (2019) without-project conditions, it is anticipated that the surface parking lot
located at Stewart Street (1903 5th Avenue) would be redeveloped to include a mixed-use
development with retail, residential, and hotel. Primary vehicular access to this new
development is currently proposed along 5th Avenue for the hotel use while the residential
component is anticipated to take access from the alley. This would potentially reduce traffic
volumes within the alley. The proposed loading area for 1903 5th Avenue would be accessed
via the alley and could result in increased loading activity in the alley or potential short-term
blockages. As noted above, with future development in the vicinity, the alley intersections
with Virginia and Stewart Streets are anticipated to operate at LOS D or better during both
the weekday AM and PM peak hours.


Corridor Operations
In addition to the intersection and alley operations, corridor operations were reviewed along
Stewart Street and Olive Way.

Existing and future (2021) without-project corridor operations are taken from the WSCC
Transportation Discipline Report1 and are presented in Table 4. A horizon year of 2021 was
utilized for the corridor analysis consistent with the WSCC report.

The Seattle monorail runs down the center of 5th Avenue with two travel lanes on either side
of the alignment. Approximately 85 percent of the reported collisions were angled or left-turn
collisions along 5th Avenue likely caused by making lane changes or turns to and from the
opposite side of the monorail alignment.

SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates a list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The review
screens the previous year collisions for signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a
year. The 5th Avenue/ Virginia Street intersection was listed as a signalized intersection HCL
in 2013; however, the intersection was removed in 2014 due to significant decreases in
collisions (i.e., 12 collisions in 2013 and only 5 collisions in 2014). The City will continue to
monitor this intersection annually.

The study area was also reviewed for pedestrian and bicycle related collisions. The
7th Avenue/Olive Way intersection has experienced 5 pedestrian collisions in the past three
years. The 6th Avenue corridor between Olive Way and Stewart Street has experienced 3
bicyclist collisions over the past three years. Overall, within the study area, there were 5
collision involving bicycles and 9 involving pedestrians, with no reported fatalities. Generally,
the pedestrian collisions were due to driver inattention of pedestrians within the crosswalk
and cyclists when changing lanes.

SDOT’s annual review of HCLs also screens locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike
collisions. SDOT’s Draft 2015 Candidate Locations report has identified the 7th Avenue/Olive
Way intersection as a high pedestrian collision location with 5 collisions in the past three
years. Collisions are generally on the east leg crosswalk with 6 of 8 involving left-turning
vehicles. In August 2013, the City installed signs indicating “Turning Vehicle Stop for
Pedestrians" and since that time there has only been 1 collision on the east leg. The City is
continuing to monitor this location.

cycle track along 5th Avenue from Olive Way to Denny Way in 2016 and 4th Avenue from
Cedar Street to S King Street/2nd Avenue Extension S in 2017. The City is currently
evaluating the cycle track routes for 4th and 5th Avenues to determine the best alignment
between Denny Way and S King Street/2nd Avenue Extension S. The 2015 – 2020 Adopted
CIP also includes multimodal corridor improvements along 3rd Avenue between S Jackson
Street and Denny Way such as additional streetscape improvements, remarking crosswalks,
and installing pedestrian countdown signals.


Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.

Existing
The study area is well served by transit with service provided by King County Metro Transit,
Community Transit, and Sound Transit.

Bus Service. There are several bus stops within less than a quarter mile (or 5-minute)
walking distance from the site. Service is provided along 4th Avenue, 3rd Avenue, Virginia
Street, Stewart Street, Olive Way, and Lenora Street in the immediate vicinity of the site. The
nearest bus stop to the project site is located along 4th Avenue between Virginia and Stewart
Streets with service provided by King County Metro Routes 212 and 217 and Sound Transit
Routes 550 and 554. Other bus facilities nearby include a bus layover area along Virginia
Street between 3rd and 4th Avenue and between 4th Avenue and 5th Avenue.

The primary transit corridor in the vicinity of the site is along 3rd Avenue with the nearest bus
stop on the north side of 3rd Avenue between Lenora Street and Virginia Street. This corridor
is served by 28 different bus routes. It is served by RapidRide C, D, and E lines as well as
multiple frequent transit lines to North, Central, and South Seattle neighborhoods. Within the
study area, during weekday peak commute periods (6 – 9 a.m. and 3 – 6:30 p.m.), 3rd
Avenue restricts through traffic to transit vehicles only. General purpose traffic is permitted to
travel one block in order to access parking garages along 3rd Avenue.

Light Rail. The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (DSTT) Westlake Station is approximately
three blocks from the site. The transit tunnel is served by the Central Link light rail as well as
bus service. Service within the tunnel connects the site to destinations within Seattle as well
as throughout the Puget Sound region.

Streetcar. The downtown terminus of the South Lake Union Transit streetcar line is located
at the Stewart Street/Westlake Avenue intersection. The streetcar provides service to the
eastern portion of Belltown and South Lake Union.

Future
The proposed Center City Connector streetcar is projected to open in 2018/2019 and will run
along Stewart Street from 1st Avenue to 6th Avenue. The system is projected to carry up to
30,000 weekday riders and will serve the City of Seattle’s three intermodal hubs including
Westlake Intermodal Hub, Colman Dock Intermodal Hub, and King Street Intermodal Hub.
The Connector will provide convenient transfers to the 3rd Avenue Transit Spine at both ends
of Downtown, Link Light Rail via multiple DSTT station entries, and Sounder Commuter Rail
at King Street Station. The line is planned to operate from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through
Saturday and 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sundays. Ten minute headways will be provided for the
City Center Connector during peak periods on all days.

Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) and King County Metro are working together
on the 3rd Avenue Transit Corridor Improvements. The project is part of a larger plan to
create a vibrant, safe and thriving 3rd Avenue. It will improve transit function and create a
more welcoming urban environment along the corridor between Denny Way and Jackson
Street. The project includes upgrades to transit amenities, improved lighting, enhancements
to landscaping, and provision of artistic elements such as murals and intersection features.
Final design for the improvements is anticipated in the fall of 2016.

                                 Project Impacts
This section documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding street system and
identifies potential mitigation measures where necessary.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site. The net new trips generated by the
development, for purposes of assessing the impacts of the project, takes into account the
current trips on the network, which are being generated by the existing uses on-site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then the
proportion of person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level
of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the multimodal nature of travel in an
urban setting. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating
person trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the
person trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below
illustrates the trip generation process.




Total person trips were developed for the existing and proposed uses based on trip rates
from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition and average vehicle occupancy (AVO) from the
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating
Techniques for Urban Planning.

Person trips by mode and vehicle trips for the existing and proposed uses were determine as
follows:
Existing Uses
           Office. Mode split and AVO for the existing office were based on the Commute
            Seattle’s 2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split report for the Belltown
            neighborhood. The data shows 30 percent of employee trips by vehicle, 49 percent
            by transit, and 21 percent walking, biking, or other modes. After applying the auto
            mode split, office person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by using
            average vehicle occupancies of 1.10.2
           Retail. Given the nature of the existing retail, it mainly serves local residents and
            workers. This results in a high proportion of walking trips to and from the surrounding
            neighborhood. The analysis assumes that 10 percent of the retail customers would
            drive to the site and that the average vehicle occupancy would be 1.10.3
           Restaurant. The restaurant serves the local area and draws some regional trips. It
            was assumed approximately 15 percent of customers travel via vehicle and that the
            AVO is 1.50.
Proposed Uses
           Residential. Mode splits for the residential component were determined from the US
            Census 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting
            Characteristics.4 The survey shows a 37 percent auto mode split for census tract 72
            where the project is located. After applying the auto mode split, residential person
            trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by assuming an AVO of 1.05 based on
            census data.5
           Hotel. The mode splits and AVO for the hotel use were based on other studies
            completed for downtown hotels in Seattle. The results mode splits included 70
            percent of hotel guests walking, bike, or using other modes and 30 percent arriving
            by vehicle. 6 Hotel person trips were converted back to vehicle trips by assuming an
            AVO 1.50, consistent with similar projects in the area.
           Restaurant. The restaurant is anticipated to serve the local area including residents
            and employees living and working nearby; however, it may draw some trips outside
            the local area given the rooftop experience. It was assumed approximately 20
            percent of customers would travel via vehicle and that the AVO would be 1.50
            consistent with the hotel.
           Retail. Given the nature and size of the proposed retail, it is anticipated this would
            mainly serve local residents, workers and hotel guests. This would result in a high
            proportion of walking trips to and from the surrounding neighborhood. The analysis
            assumes that 10 percent of the retail customers would drive to the site and that the
            average vehicle occupancy would be 1.10.7

Additionally, approximately 3,000 square feet of drinking establishment is anticipated as part
of the hotel/restaurant uses. As indicated in the ITE land use descriptions, both the Hotel (LU
#310) and High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant (LU #932) include a bar area or cocktail
lounge and therefore was not included separately as part of the proposed project trip
generation. The ITE land use descriptions are included in Appendix D for reference.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in Table 7, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 1,490 net
new daily vehicle trips with 98 net new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 126 net
new vehicle trips during the PM peak hour.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based on guidance
from the Director’s Rule 5-2009, OnTheMap, a review of existing travel patterns, planned
improvements, and previously approved traffic studies in the vicinity. OnTheMap is a web-
based mapping and reporting application, which shows where residents are employed and
workers live based on census data. In reviewing the OnTheMap, consideration is given to
trips closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations that would likely
occur via transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes.

Figures 6 through 11 illustrate the inbound and outbound vehicle trip distribution and
assignment for the components of the proposed project. The weekday PM peak hour trips
were assigned to the study area based on the travel patterns and the location of the site
access. The assignment considers valet operations including hotel and restaurant drop-
off/pick-up along the 5th Avenue frontage and residential access via the existing alley. Trips
associated with the valet services were not considered multiple trips, but they were assigned
to reflect valet operations where the driver drops off or picks up the vehicle along 5th Avenue
and the valet attendant drives the vehicle to and from the garage. The distribution and
assignment considers the primary travel routes within the gridded street system where project

impacts would be greatest. It is recognized that drivers may take alternative routes; however,
it is anticipated that impacts along these facilities would be less than disclosed in this
analysis.

The project traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes
to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2019 with-project traffic volumes
are shown on Figure 12.

As shown in Table 7, the percent traffic volume impacts generally range from 1 to 5 percent
at the off-site study during the weekday PM peak hour. The project would have the greatest
impact at the alley intersections along Virginia and Stewart Streets due to the overall lower
total entering volumes at these locations and because these are the primary access points to
the site.

Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The with-project conditions were evaluated using the
same methods and assumptions as existing and without-project conditions. A comparison of
future without and with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is summarized for
the project site in Table 8. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E or worse as poor operations at
signalized intersections and LOS F as poor operations at unsignalized intersections.

Alley Operations
Consistent with City of Seattle requirements, access to an underground parking garage and
loading/delivery area are provided via the alley. Traffic volumes along the alley would
increase by approximately 120 vehicles per hour during the weekday AM peak hour and 150
vehicles per hour during the PM peak hour as a result of the project. Table 10 provides a
summary of the anticipated LOS for the alley access.

3.   Worst movement reported for unsignalized intersections.


As discussed previously, the City does not define a LOS standard for individual intersections;
however, the City generally recognizes LOS F as poor operations for unsignalized locations.
With the increase in traffic, the alley access intersections with Virginia and Stewart Streets
are anticipated to operate at LOS D during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak
hour under future (2019) without-project conditions. With the addition of project traffic, the
alley access with Virginia Street is anticipated to degrade to LOS F and the alley access with
Stewart Street is anticipated to continue to operate at LOS D during the AM peak hour.
During the PM peak hour, the Virginia Street and Stewart Street alley access locations are
anticipated to degrade to LOS F under future (2019) with-project conditions.

As described in the existing conditions, blockages occur within the alley due to loading. The
surface parking lot located at Stewart Street (1903 5th Avenue) would be redeveloped with
access to the Stanford Hotel proposed along 5th Avenue, which is also anticipated to add
traffic to the alley. The Stanford Hotel would represent approximately 4 percent of the
anticipated future traffic at the alley access given that the primary access for general vehicles
associated with the Hotel would be via 5th Avenue. As noted in the discussion of future
without-project conditions, the proposed delivery/loading for the Stanford Hotel and
residential component would be accessed via the alley and could result in increased loading
activity in the alley or potential short-term blockages. In addition, several of the existing
blockages observed were related to the existing Icon Grill restaurant, which would be
removed with the proposed project.

Blockages related to the Escala building would continue if loading operations for that property
are managed similar to current conditions. During periods of alley blockage caused by the
Escala project, traffic entering and exiting the proposed project parking garage would utilize
the alley to travel south to Stewart Street.


Corridor Operations
In addition to the intersection and alley operations, corridor operations were reviewed along
Stewart Street and Olive Way. Anticipated queuing at the site access locations was also
reviewed.

As shown in Table 11, with the addition of project generated traffic both study corridors are
anticipated to continue to operate at the same LOS as under future (2019) without-project
conditions with little to no increase in vehicle delay.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include South of Lake Union (8),
South of Jackson St (10.11) and East of CBD (12.12) as shown in Table 12. As a
conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the
direction of the screenlines would extend across the screenlines.

would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.

Service Access/Deliveries
Loading for the proposed project would occur at a new loading dock within the site reducing
the frequency of site related blockages. The loading dock would accommodate three vehicles
concurrently and access to the loading dock would be provided via the existing alley. The
loading dock is positioned such that conflicts with the existing Escala loading dock would be
reduced. Additionally, the loading dock bay access is located south of the northern project
edge to eliminate encroachment on the sidewalk for the backing maneuvers.

A truck turning analysis was completed for the loading dock area to assess the size of truck
that could be accommodated by the new loading dock. Appendix F shows the truck turning
maneuvers the anticipated delivery vehicles serving the proposed project. As shown in the
figures, the loading docks can accommodate single-unit 30-foot trucks (SU-30) or smaller
entirely within the loading bay.

Cumulatively, with the proposed project and the Stanford Hotel project the frequency of alley
blockages should decrease compared to current conditions since both proposals would
provide loading docks within the site and off the alley. This projects would provide a dock
management plan to minimize impacts to the alley and provide loading on-site as well as
control trucks idling and waiting in the alley.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
demand of the project, and parking code requirements.
Supply
The proposed project provides an underground parking garage. The current proposal would
provide vehicle stackers on parking levels P5 and P6, which would result in 239 parking
spaces. Without accounting for stackers, the parking would accommodate 198 vehicles would
be accommodated. Potential parking impacts are considered for parking supply ranging from
198 to 239 spaces. This value assumes an optimized and managed parking supply through
valet operations. Access to the parking garage would be provided via the existing alley
between Virginia and Stewart Streets. As noted previously, hotel guests, retail guests, and
some residents parking in the garage would utilize the proposed 5th Avenue curb space. The
valet loading/unloading areas along 5th Avenue would eliminate approximately 3 to 4 paid
parking spaces along the project frontage.
Demand
The parking demand for the proposed project is expected to be below national averages due
the project’s proximity to transit service and its location in Belltown, a high-density urban
village with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The peak parking
demand for the proposed project was estimated based on data provided in ITE Parking
Generation (4th Edition), local mode of travel data consistent with the trip generation
analysis, and local vehicle ownership data. 9 Auto ownership data is based on the US Census
data. PSRC data was reviewed and it was determined to have an insufficient sample size for
this localized area and is not recommended for this application. This approach is consistent
with approved traffic studies conducted in the vicinity of the site.

Residential. Parking demand for the residential component of the project was based on US

proposed mix of apartment units10, the estimated peak parking demand rate for the
apartments is 0.47 vehicles per unit, which results in a parking demand of 203 vehicles.

Hotel. The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the hotel land use is
based on the ITE Parking Generation suburban rates for a hotel (#310). The vehicle mode
split was assumed to be the same as used to estimate peak hour trip generation (30 percent
by vehicle). Based on the proposed hotel land use, a net parking rate of 0.27 vehicles per
dwelling unit was used, which results in a parking demand of 42 vehicles.

Restaurant. The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the restaurant
based on the ITE Parking Generation suburban rates for a high-turnover restaurant (#932)
with a bar or lounge. The vehicle mode split was assumed to be the same as used to
estimate peak hour trip generation. A vehicle mode split of 20 percent was assumed for the
restaurant. Based on the proposed restaurant land use, a net parking rate of 2.66 vehicles
per 1,000 square-feet was used for restaurant use, which results in a parking demand of 28
vehicles.

Retail. The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the retail is based on
the ITE Parking Generation suburban rates for shopping center (#820). The vehicle mode
split was assumed to be the same as used to estimate peak hour trip generation. Vehicle
mode split for retail was assumed to be 10 percent. A parking rate of 0.26 vehicles per 1,000
square-feet was used for retail use, which results in a parking demand of 1 vehicle.

Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix G. Consideration was given to shared parking
between the uses, which shows that the peak parking demand for the site would occur
overnight. Hourly parking demand by use was based on time of day data provided in ITE
Parking Generation, 4th Edition. Figure 13 illustrates the shared parking demand for the
proposed project. The analysis indicates that the peak parking demand for the proposed
project would be 242 vehicles. With the proposed parking supply of 198-239 spaces, there is
a potential that during peak periods vehicles may need to utilize off-site parking. The potential
spillover could be between 3 and 44 vehicles. In addition, the project would displace 3 to 4
paid parking spaces along the project frontage.

  The proposed apartment units include 20 studio units, 330 open or one bedroom units, 82 two bedroom units, and
5 three bedroom units.

There would also likely be some parking associated with residential visitors. While guests of
the residential uses could use the valet service, it is likely that a high percentage of this
demand would utilize on-street parking or parking lots in the area. A visitor parking demand
rate of 0.05 vehicles per unit is assumed based on previously approved transportation studies
in the area.11 This would result in a peak parking demand of 22 vehicles, which would likely
occur in the evening hours. Based on the potential parking spillover (3-44 vehicles), displaced
on-street parking (3-4 spaces), and visitor parking (22 vehicles), there would be a total
potential off-site parking demand of 328 to 70 vehicles.

A review of the SDOT’s Annual Report 2015 On-Street Paid Occupancy data within 800-feet
of the site shows that during the evening hours when on-site parking would peak there is
some availability in the area. However, with consideration of parking spillover and displaced
of surface lots from other planned developments as well as consideration of on-street parking
that may be removed with the streetcar and/or protected bike lanes in the area, it is
anticipated that on-street parking would have limited availability. There are many off-street
lots and garages within walking distance of the proposed project. A field review indicates
there would be availability to accommodate parking within publicly-available garages in the
vicinity of the site. The garage located at 3rd Avenue and Virginia Street has 312 spaces and
approximately 15 percent were utilized in the late evening. Similarly, the garage located at
3rd Avenue and Stewart Street has 754 parking spaces and only 1 percent were occupied in
the late evening.

Off-Street Vehicle Parking
The project includes 248 parking spaces for the residential and commercial uses. All of the
parking is intended to managed through valet services. Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC)
23.54.015, there is no minimum parking requirement for development located within the
Belltown urban center.
Bicycle Parking
Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

SMC Section 23.49.019, Table A outlines the bicycle parking siting and quantity
requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for residential,
retail, and hotel uses. Bicycle paring is not required for retail uses under 10,000 square feet.
Required bicycle parking rate is reduced in half after the first 50 parking spaces provided per
land use. The bicycle parking requirements are shown in Table 13.

                                 Mitigation Summary
The proposed project would construct frontage improvements along 5th Avenue and Virginia
Street. Additional detail on mitigation measures is provided below.


Off-Site Improvements
Based on the operation analyses at the study intersections and the impacts that project traffic
has on the surrounding street network, it is anticipated that the existing infrastructure
surrounding the proposed project will be sufficient to accommodate the off-site vehicles,
transit, and non-motorized trips generated by the proposed development.


Parking
The evaluation indicates that some of the primary parking demand would need to be
accommodated off-site during the evening and early morning hours. In addition, while guests
of the residential uses could use the valet service, it is likely that a high percentage of this
demand would utilize on-street parking or surface lots in the area. A review of available
parking in the study area indicates that off-street garages could accommodate visitors. It is
likely that actual parking demands may decrease with declining auto ownership in urban
areas, improvements in access to alternative modes, and scarcity of parking.


Dock Management Plan
Loading/unloading in the alley would impact operations of the proposed parking garage
access as well as other functions occurring along the alley. A dock management plan would
be prepared to coordinate deliveries for the proposed project. This plan would provide
protocols on scheduling and timing of deliveries to minimize alley impacts of trucks waiting to
access loading berths.

                         Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the mixed use development
located at 5th Avenue and Virginia Street in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. General
findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would construct up to 431 residential apartment units, 155
           hotel rooms, 10,500 square feet of restaurant, and 1,000 square feet of retail.
          After accounting for the existing site uses, the development is anticipated to
           generate 1,490 net new vehicular weekday daily trips with 98 occurring during the
           weekday AM peak hour and 126 during the PM peak hour.
          All of the off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better
           with the project.
          The City does not define a LOS standard for individual intersections; however, the
           City generally recognizes LOS F as poor operations for unsignalized locations.
           Under future (2019) with-project conditions, during the AM peak hour the alley
           intersections with Virginia Street and Stewart Street are anticipated to operate at
           LOS E and LOS D, respectively. During the PM peak hour both alley locations are
           anticipated to operate at LOS F.
          Cumulatively, with the proposed project and the Stanford Hotel project the
           frequency of alley blockages should decrease compared to current conditions since
           both proposals would provide loading docks within the site and off the alley. The
           proposed project would provide a dock management plan to minimize impacts to
           the alley and provide loading on-site.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The proposed parking supply of 198 to 239 spaces would accommodate the
           anticipate peak parking demand for the residential, hotel, and restaurant/retail uses
           during a majority of the day. There is available parking in off-street parking garages
           that are located nearby to accommodate additional parking needs during peak
           periods.
