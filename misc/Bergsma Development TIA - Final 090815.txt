1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Gibson Traffic Consultants, Inc. (GTC) was hired to provide a traffic analysis of the 78-unit
Bergsma Development. The development is located on the west side of Newport Way, west of SR-
900. The analysis was scoped with City of Issaquah staff to include the intersections of SR-900 at
Newport Way and Newport Way at the site access. The analysis was been performed for the AM
and PM peak-hour and also includes an analysis with the reassignment of trips from the Talus
Development. The analysis shows that the study intersections will operate at acceptable levels of
service during the AM and PM peak-hour with the development and with the reassignment of the
Talus Development trips. Frontage improvements and payment of the appropriate traffic impact
fee is all that should be required to mitigate the impacts of the development. The current traffic
impact fee, $7,904.10 per unit, results in a total traffic mitigation fee of $616,519.80.


2. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

The Bergsma Development is located along the west side of Newport Way, west of SR-900. The
development is proposed to consist of 78 single-family units on 46 acres that are currently
undeveloped and zoned as Residential, SF-E and SF-S. Access is proposed to include a new access
to Newport Way and a connection to the Talus Development. The development is anticipated to
be constructed in the year 2017. A site vicinity map showing the site is included in Figure 1.

       2.1 Methodology

A detailed scoping process was performed with City of Issaquah staff. The scoping process
identified the trip generation methodology, trip distribution and scope of the full analysis. The trip
generation is based on data from the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) Trip Generation Manual – Volume 2: Data. The trip distribution is based on count data and
previous analysis in the site vicinity. The trip generation and trip distribution were approved as
part of the scoping process.

During the scoping process the City of Issaquah staff identified the following intersections for
analysis:

   1. SR-900 at Newport Way
   2. Newport Wat at Site Access

The intersection analysis has been performed for the AM peak-hour, the highest hour between 7:00
AM and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak-hour, the highest hour between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The
City of Issaquah staff identified the following developments as pipeline development that are to
be included in the intersection analysis:

      Gateway Apartments – 400 apartments
      Gateway Senior Housing – 136 units
      Riva – 33 condominiums

Additionally, a 2% annually compounding growth rate has been included in the calculations of
future vehicles at the study intersections. The development is proposed to include a connection to
the Talus Development, which will provide a connection to Newport Way for units within the
Talus Development. The City of Issaquah staff asked for analysis without and with this connection.
This connection would result in a portion of the trips generated by the Talus Development using
the Bergsma Development access.

The intersection analysis has been performed for the following conditions:

      2015 Existing Conditions
      2017 Baseline Conditions
      2017 Future with Development Conditions
      2017 Future with Development Conditions and Talus

Congestion at intersections and along arterials is generally measured in terms of level of service
(LOS). In accordance with Highway Capacity Manual: 2010 Edition (HCM) by the Transportation
Research Board, road facilities and intersections are rated between LOS A and LOS F, with LOS
A being free flow and LOS F being forced flow or over-capacity conditions. The level of service
at signalized, roundabout and all-way stop-controlled intersections is based on the average delay
of all approaches. The level of service for two-way stop-controlled intersections is based on
average delays for the critical stopped approach. The City of Auburn uses the average travel speed
to determine the level of service for arterial segments. Geometric characteristics and conflicting
traffic movements are taken into consideration when determining level of service values. A
summary of the intersection level of service criteria is included in Table 1.

The City of Issaquah utilizes LOS D as the acceptable level of service threshold; however, the
WSDOT level of service standards have been applied for the intersection of SR-900 at Newport
Way. The WSDOT Development Services Manual identifies LOS E as an acceptable level of
service for urban non-Highways of Statewide Significance that are within a 3-mile buffer of
freeways, such as I-5. These are considered Tier 1 roadways. The WSDOT level of service criteria

     LOS A: Free-flow traffic conditions, with minimal delay to stopped vehicles (no vehicle is delayed longer
            than one cycle at signalized intersection).
     LOS B: Generally stable traffic flow conditions.
     LOS C: Occasional back-ups may develop, but delay to vehicles is short term and still tolerable.
     LOS D: During short periods of the peak hour, delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial but are
            tolerable during times of less demand (i.e. vehicles delayed one cycle or less at signal).
     LOS E: Intersections operate at or near capacity, with long queues developing on all approaches and long
            delays.
     LOS F: Jammed conditions on all approaches with excessively long delays and vehicles unable to move at
            times.

3. EXISTING CONDITIONS

       3.1 Existing Roadway Conditions

The Bergsma Development is proposed to include one new access to Newport Way. Newport Way
currently is a 2-lane roadway with paved shoulders and a paved pedestrian facility with curbing
along the east side. The intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way is a signalized intersection with
separate turning lanes on all approaches. There are also two northbound and southbound through
lanes.

       3.2 Existing Traffic Volumes

Existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movements were collected at the intersection of SR-900
at Newport Way for the intersection analysis. Existing AM and PM peak-hour counts were also
obtained at the intersection of SR-900 at NW Talus Drive, which have been used to determine the
trip distribution and to help estimate the potential reassignment of Talus Development trips with
the proposed connection through the Bergsma Development. The existing AM and PM peak-hour
turning movements at the intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way are shown in Figure 2 and Figure
3, respectively. The existing turning movement counts are included in the attachments.


4. FUTURE CONDITIONS

       4.1 Future Roadway Conditions

Roadway improvements at the intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way or along Newport Way
west of SR-900 have not been included in the analysis. The future conditions are based on the
existing channelization and control at the study intersections.

       4.2 Baseline Traffic Volumes

The baseline traffic volumes at the study intersections have been calculated by applying a 2%
annually compounding growth rate to the 2015 existing turning movements and trips from the
following pipeline developments:

      Gateway Apartments – 400 apartments
      Gateway Senior Housing – 136 units
      Riva – 33 condominiums

The pipeline trips have been assigned to the different movements at the study intersections based
on data provided by City of Issaquah staff and the trip distribution utilized for the trips generated
by the Bergsma Development. The 2017 baseline turning movements are shown in Figure 4 and
Figure 5 for the AM and PM peak-hours, respectively. The turning movement calculations are
included in the attachments.

       4.3 Trip Generation

The trip generation methodology and calculations for the Bergsma Development were approved
as part of the scoping process with City of Issaquah staff. The trip generation calculations are based
on the national data available in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation
Manual, 9th Edition (2012). The trip generation calculations have been performed based on the
average trip generation rates for ITE Land Use Land Use Code 210, Single-Family Detached
Housing. The trip generation of the Bergsma Development is summarized in Table 2.

       4.4 Trip Distribution and Assignment

Trip distribution and traffic assignments for the Bergsma Development are based on previous
analysis conducted in the site vicinity and count data collected in the site vicinity. The distribution
was approved by City of Issaquah staff during the scoping process.

It is anticipated that 50% of the development’s trips will travel along SR-900, forty percent to and
from the north and ten percent to and from the south. Approximately 30% of the development’s
trips are expected to travel to and from the west along Newport Way. The remaining 20% of the
development’s trips will travel to and from the east along Newport Way, east of SR-900. The
detailed trip distribution and trip assignments at the study intersections are shown in Figure 6 for
the AM peak-hour and Figure 7 for the PM peak-hour.

       4.5 Future with Development Traffic Volumes

The Bergsma Development is anticipated to be fully constructed by the end of 2017. The 2017
future with development traffic volumes have been calculated by adding the development trips to
the 2017 baseline traffic volumes. The 2017 future with development traffic volumes at the study
intersections are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 for the AM and PM peak-hours, respectively.

           4.5.1. Reassignment of Talus Development Trips

The City of Issaquah staff requested an analysis of the potential impacts of trips from the Talus
Development with the proposed connection through the Bergsma Development. The potential trips
from the Talus Development that could utilize the access to Newport Way through the Bergsma
development were estimated based on count data at the intersection of SR-900 at Talus Drive, the
sole access for the Talus Development, and the existing units within the Talus Development.

The inbound and outbound trips at the intersection of SR-900 at Talus Drive that travel to and from
the north along SR-900 are trips that could potentially be reassigned to the connection through the
Bergsma Development. Using aerial data, it is estimated that half of the units in the Talus
Development are between Talus Drive and the Bergsma Development and that half of these units
would utilize the connection through the Bergsma Development. It is therefore estimated that 25%
of the trips from the Talus Development that travel to and from the north could be reassigned to
the connection through the Bergsma Development. This reassignment results in the following trips
potentially using the connection through the Bergsma Development:

      AM peak-hour – 21 inbound and 82 outbound trips
      PM peak-hour – 74 inbound and 44 outbound trips

It is important to note that it is anticipated that fewer trips from the Talus Development would
likely utilize the connection through the Bergsma Development, but these trips represent the
highest anticipated impact to the Bergsma Development access. The traffic volumes at the study
intersections with the Bergsma Development and with the Talus reassignment are shown in Figure
10 for the AM peak-hour and Figure 11 for the PM peak-hour.

5. TRAFFIC ANALYSIS AND IMPACT

The traffic analysis has been performed for the AM and PM peak-hours at the following study
intersections:

      SR-900 at Newport Way
      Newport Wat at Site Access

The analysis has been performed for the following conditions:

      2015 Existing Conditions
      2017 Baseline Conditions
      2017 Future with Development Conditions
      2017 Future with Development Conditions with Talus

The traffic analysis has been performed using the Synchro 8.0, Build 806 software. The analysis
of the signalized intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way has utilized signal timings received from
the City of Issaquah for the PM peak-hour. Minor adjustments to the timings have been made for
the AM peak-hour due to the change in dominant traffic patterns from the PM peak-hour. The
intersection analysis has been performed in accordance with City of Issaquah guidelines.

The operations of the study intersections during the AM peak-hour are summarized in Table 3.

          Site Access

   The level of service analysis shows that the intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way will operate
   at acceptable LOS E or better with the development and with the reassignment of the Talus
   Development. The site access will operate at acceptable LOS C or better, even with the
   reassignment of the Talus Development trips. The v/c ratio for the majority of movements at the
   intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way will be less than 0.85. The majority of movements that do
   have a v/c ratio above 0.85 are left-turning movements that are not impacted by the development,
   such as the westbound left-turn and southbound left-turn. During the AM peak-hour, the v/c ratio
   of the eastbound left-turn will increase above 0.85 with the reassignment of the Talus Development
   trips. The City of Issaquah can address this increase in a variety of ways, including adjusting the
   signal timings. The impact of the Talus Development should not be considered an impact of the
   Bergsma Development since the eastbound left-turn movement will operate with a v/c ratio below
   0.85 with just the Bergsma Development.

              5.1 Queuing Analysis

   A queuing analysis for the intersection of SR-900 at Newport Road has been completed to
   determine the impact of queue lengths on the west leg (i.e. the eastbound movements). These are
   the movements that could block the access. The site access is over 600 feet from SR-900. The 50th
   Percentile and 95th Percentile queue lengths are summarized in Table 5.

Bergsma Development                                                             Traffic Impact Analysis

The queueing analysis shows that the Bergsma Development will increase the queue length by one
to two vehicles. However, the reassignment of the Talus Development trips will have a larger
increase in queue lengths, especially during the AM peak-hour. The queue length is not anticipated
to block the site access.

        5.2 Access Analysis

The access of the Bergsma Development to Newport Way is proposed to be a stop-controlled
intersection. The access is proposed to include a 100-foot northbound left-turn lane for left-turns
into the development. The level of service analysis, which includes this left-turn lane, shows that
the access is anticipated to operate at acceptable LOS C or better, even with the reassignment of
trips from the Talus Development. Additionally, the development’s access will have adequate sight
distance in both directions based on a posted speed limit of 30 mph.


6. MITIGATION IDENTIFICATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The operational analysis shows that the Bergsma Development will not significantly impact the
operations of the intersection of SR-900 at Newport Way, which is anticipated to operate at an
acceptable level of service with the development. The development should therefore only be
required to provide frontage improvements and pay the appropriate traffic impact fee. The current
traffic impact fee is $7,904.10 per single-family residential unit. This results in a total traffic impact
fee of $616,519.80. It is important to note that the fee is assessed at the time of building permit
issuance and may increase from what is identified in this report.
