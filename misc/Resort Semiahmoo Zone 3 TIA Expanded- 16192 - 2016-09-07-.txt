Transportation Impact Analysis
Resort Semiahmoo Zone 3                                                             September 2016



                                    Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential transportation-
related impacts associated with the proposed Resort Semiahmoo Zone 3 mixed use
development.


Project Description
The project is a mixed use development that is primarily residential but also includes 5,000
square-feet of retail and 24,000 square-feet of storage providing 60 storage units. The
residential component of the development is still being evaluated but includes mixes of single
family, multifamily, and duplex units. The residential uses included for the analysis assume
the higher unit options being considered which are 44 single family dwelling units, 41
multifamily units, and 22 duplex units (equivalent of 44 single family dwelling units).

In addition, part of the project site is a 1.75-acre area that is being considered to be
developed as a City park; however, if it is not developed as a City park it would be developed
as residential units. If developed as residential units this would include 7 single family
dwelling units and 4 duplex units, resulting in an overall residential development of 51 single
family dwelling units, 41 multifamily units, and 26 duplex units (equivalent of 52 single family
dwelling units). The proposed residential unit estimate is conservative. It is possible that a
lower unit count would be constructed.

The project will provide 37 parking spaces as well as 2 parking spaces per residential unit. In
addition, if the 1.75-acre area is developed as a City park, 12 parking spaces would be
provided for that use.

It is anticipated that the project would be completed, fully occupied, and generating traffic by
2020. Figure 1 illustrates the project site and surrounding vicinity.

A preliminary site plan is shown in Figure 2. As shown in the site plan, site access is
proposed via two access points. The first access is proposed as the fourth leg (the west leg)
of the Semiahmoo Parkway/Gleneagle intersection and the second access is proposed along
Semiahmoo Drive/Drayton Harbor Road, west of the Semiahmoo Parkway / Semiahmoo
Drive intersection.


Study Area
The analysis focuses on the weekday PM peak period (busiest one hour between 4:00 to
6:00 p.m.) operations at nine intersections as well as a proposed site access. This period
represents the highest cumulative total traffic for the adjacent street system providing a
conservative timeframe for level of service (LOS) analysis. The study intersections were
coordinated with the City and County and are listed below (see also Figure 1):
   1. Semiahmoo Parkway / Semiahmoo Dr                6. Harborview Rd / Lincoln Rd
   2. Semiahmoo Parkway / Gleneagle Dr                7. Harborview Rd / Anderson Rd

 Existing and Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing and future without-project conditions within the identified study
area. Characteristics are provided for the roadway network, non-motorized facilities, transit
service, existing and future without-project traffic volumes, traffic operations, and traffic
safety.


Roadway Network
The project site is bounded by Semiahmoo Drive to the northwest and Semiahmoo Parkway
to the east. The major roadways within the study area include:

Semiahmoo Parkway / Lincoln Road is a two-lane collector that extends from Harborview
Road into west Blaine. The roadway is called Lincoln Road to the east of Shintaffer Road,
and Semiahmoo Parkway to the west. Within the vicinity of the project, Semiahmoo Parkway
is a two-lane major collector south of Semiahmoo Drive and a minor collector north of
Semiahmoo Drive. Paved shoulders exist along both sides of the road, with no curbs, gutter
or sidewalks. The posted speed limit is 35 mph. A trail runs along one side within City limits.

Semiahmoo Drive is a two-lane major collector that runs west of Semiahmoo Parkway.
Unpaved shoulders exist along both sides of the roadway, with no curbs or sidewalks along
either side. A trail is provided along the south side of the roadway, in the project vicinity. The
posted speed limit is 35 to 45 mph.

Drayton Harbor Road is a two-lane minor collector that runs east of Semiahmoo Parkway.
Unpaved shoulders exist along both sides of the roadway, with no curbs or sidewalks along
either side. The posted speed limit is 35 mph. A trail runs along one side within City limits.

Gleneagle Drive is a two-lane roadway classified as a local road providing access to an
existing residential development east of Semiahmoo Parkway.

Shintaffer Road is a two-lane collector that runs north-south from Drayton Harbor Road to
Birch Bay Drive. Unpaved shoulders exist along both sides of Shintaffer Road in the
proposed Project vicinity, with no curb, gutter or sidewalks. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

Harborview Road is a two-lane, north-south collector that extends from Drayton Harbor
Road south to Birch Bay Drive. Within the study area, there are unpaved shoulders with no
curb along both sides of the street. The posted speed limit is 40 mph.

Blaine Road (SR 548) is a two-lane state highway that connects to I-5 to the north within
downtown Blaine. Unpaved shoulders exist along both sides of the road in the proposed
Project vicinity, with no curbs on either side. The posted speed limit is 35 mph to 45 mph.

Birch Bay-Lynden Road is a two-lane collector that runs east-west from Harborview Road to
the City of Lynden. Intermittent paved shoulders exist within the Project vicinity with no curb,
gutter or sidewalks provided. The posted speed limit is 40 to 50 mph.

The study intersections are either side-street stop controlled or all-way stop controlled
intersections. The Semiahmoo Parkway / Semiahmoo Drive and Blaine Rd / Birch Bay-
Lynden Road intersections are all-way stop-controlled intersections and the remaining study
intersections are side-street stop controlled intersections.

Non-Motorized Facilities
The study area has both regional recreation and community trails. Regional recreational trails
have a county-wide significance drawing users from throughout the region and community
trails link neighborhoods, major parks, schools, commercial centers, and other destinations
throughout the City. The nearest trail, is a paved trail along the south side of Semiahmoo
Drive along the project frontage. In addition, there are two regional recreational trails
including the Semiahmoo Split Loop Trail and Coast Millennium Trail. The Semiahmoo Spit
trail is an eight-foot bicycle/pedestrian path that parallels Semiahmoo Parkway and is
separated by a planting strip which loops around the entire Spit and extends along
Semiahmoo Parkway adjacent to the north side of the proposed project site. The Coast
Millennium Trail travels from Birch Bay through Semiahmoo across Drayton Harbor on the
foot-ferry1 then along Marine Drive and to the United States/Canadian border. As discussed
previously, no sidewalk facilities are provided along most of the roadways within the study
area.


Transit and Ferry Service
Whatcom Transit Authority (WTA) serves the City of Blaine with two routes serving downtown
Blaine provide service to Cordata and Bellingham; however, no routes are provided in the
vicinity of the project. Although, no routes are available within the vicinity of the project, WTA
provides Zone Service to the site area. WTA Zone Service provides limited transit service to
rural areas with advance reservations, which is limited to Monday thru Thursday within the
project area zone.

Excursion passenger ferry service is provided seasonally north of the project site between the
Spit across Drayton Harbor to Blaine on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays between Memorial
Day and Labor Day. The ferry is owned by the City of Blaine and leased to the Drayton
Harbor Maritime Society.


Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Blaine’s Six-Year (2016-2021) Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP) as well as the Whatcom Council of Governments 2016-2019 Transportation
Improvement Program, no funded improvements were identified that would change existing
conditions at the study intersections. Three unfunded improvements were identified:
        Resurfacing Semiahmoo Parkway from Drayton Harbor Road to the City Limits,
         approximately 1.5 miles that is anticipated to occur in 2018;
        Semiahmoo Spit pedestrian path safety improvements from the County Park to the
         Marina which is anticipated to be completed by 2019;
        Lincoln Road reconstruction from Harborview Rd to SR 548 which is anticipated to be
         completed by 2019.

These projects would not change the existing capacity at the study intersections.


Traffic Volumes
Figure 3 illustrates existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.
Traffic counts were collected at the study intersections in May and August 2016. Detailed
intersection traffic counts are provided in Appendix A. Traffic volumes were rounded to the
nearest five vehicles since weekday volumes fluctuate day-to-day.

1 The foot-ferry is seasonal and provides a pedestrian link between Semiahmoo Spit and the Wharf District or West

Future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by increasing
existing traffic volumes by 2 percent per year to 2020 and adding traffic generated by 2
pipeline developments within the vicinity of the project identified through coordination with
City staff, and consistent with previous studies in the vicinity of the project. This growth rate is
consistent with previous studies in the vicinity of the site. The pipeline projects included are
Semiahmoo Spit Master Plan, Semiahmoo Shores, Sea Grass Cottages, Zone 26, Lot 3,
Drayton Hillside, Prestwick Woods, Ridge at Semiahmoo.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For all-way stop controlled locations, LOS is measured in
average delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections, LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle and is reported for the
worst operating approach or movement of the intersection. Traffic operations for an
intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A through
F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and
long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria and
definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Based on the City of Blaine’s Comprehensive Plan (2006), the City has adopted an LOS D or
better standard. Table 1 summarizes the existing and future without-project weekday PM
peak hour LOS at study intersections. The detailed LOS worksheets are included in Appendix
C.

As shown in Table 1, all study intersections currently operate at LOS C or better under
existing conditions during the weekday PM peak hour, with the exception of the Blaine Road /
Birch Bay-Lynden Road intersection. This intersection is shown to operate at LOS E under
existing conditions and would degrade to LOS F in the future. The County has been
considering a roundabout for this location to improve operations. Additionally, the eastbound
left-turn movements of the Harborview Road / Lincoln Road and Blaine Road/ Drayton Harbor
Road intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS E and LOS F during future without-
project conditions respectively. The remaining study intersections are anticipated to operate
at acceptable levels.

Traffic Safety
Collision records were reviewed at the study intersections to document any potential traffic
safety issues. The most recent summary of collision data from WSDOT is for the three-year
period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. A historical review of collisions
was conducted at off-site study intersections. A summary of the total and average annual
number of reported collisions as well as the collisions rate at each study intersection is
provided in Table 2.

1. Million Entering Vehicles

The collision rate is representative of the number of collisions per one million entering
vehicles (MEV) at each intersection. Intersections with a rate greater than 1.0 collision per
MEV are typically flagged for further investigation to determine whether an adverse condition
exists. As shown in the table, all study intersections are at or below 0.6 collisions per MEV.

The highest number of collisions occurred at the Blaine Road (SR 548) / Birch Bay-Lynden
Road intersection with an average of approximately 2 collisions per year. The most frequent
collision type at this intersection was reported to be angle collisions.

There were no reported fatalities in the study area as well as no reported pedestrian or
bicyclist collisions.

                                            Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents potential project-generated impacts on the
surrounding street network and study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated
by the proposed project are distributed and assigned to the adjacent street system. Next,
project trips are added to future without-project traffic volumes and any potential impacts to
traffic operations, non-motorized, and safety are identified. Site access operations are also
discussed.


Trip Generation
Trip generation for the proposed mixed-use development is summarized in Table 3.
Estimates for the project-generated vehicle trips were calculated using average peak hour trip
rates for single-family detached housing, apartments, self-storage, City park, and retail
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation (9th Edition,
2012). As described previously, the proposed project would construct 44 single family
dwelling units, 22 duplex units (equivalent to 44 single family dwelling units), 41 multi-family
units, 5,000 square-feet of retail, and 24,000 square-feet of storage providing 60 storage
units. In addition, a 1.75-acre area of the site would either be constructed as City park or as
residential including 7 single family dwelling units and 4 duplex units. Both of these options
are shown in the table below.

The proposed project would generate approximately 138 to 147 new weekday PM peak hour
trips depending on if the 1.75-acre area of the site is developed as a park or as residential,
respectively. A range of 84 to 90 inbound and 54 to 57 outbound weekday PM peak hour trips

are estimated for the two options. As noted above, this estimate is conservative as it is
possible that a lower residential unit count would be constructed.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
Project trip distribution was estimated based on existing travel patterns in the study area and
previous projects submitted in the vicinity of the project. Figure 5 illustrates the anticipated
trip distribution during the weekday PM peak hours. As shown in Figure 5, the trips are
distributed with approximately 10 percent to/from the east along Drayton Harbor Road, 70
percent to/from the south along Semiahmoo Parkway, 15 percent to/from the north via
Semiahmoo Parkway to the Spit and 5 percent to/from the west via Semiahmoo Drive.

Weekday PM peak hour project trips were assigned to the study intersections based on the
travel patterns described above. In order to provide a conservative analysis, the higher trip
generation estimates (Option 2 – the 1.75-acre area being developed as residential) were
assumed. The resulting trip assignment is shown in Figure 5.


Future With-Project Traffic Volumes
Site-generated weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes were added to the future without-
project traffic volumes at the study intersections. The resulting future (2020) with-project peak
hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 6.

Future With-Project Traffic Operations
Future 2020 with-project study intersection operations were evaluated for the weekday
PM peak hours. Intersection LOS was calculated using the methodology described
previously. The without-project conditions are compared to the with-project conditions to
understand the potential traffic impacts of the proposed project. Table 4 summarizes the
2020 without and with-project intersection operations for the weekday PM peak hours. LOS
worksheets are included in Appendix C.

2. Average delay per vehicle in seconds.

As shown in Table 4, with the addition of project traffic, the study intersections would continue
to operate at LOS D with the exception of the Blaine Road / Birch Bay-Lynden Road,
Harborview Road / Lincoln Road, and Blaine Road / Drayton Harbor Road intersections. The
Blaine Road / Birch Bay-Lynden Road intersection is anticipated to continue to operate at
LOS F from without-project to with-project conditions with the addition of approximately 21
seconds of delay. The County has been considering a roundabout for this intersection as the
future improvement. The Harborview Road / Lincoln Road intersection is anticipated to
degrade from LOS E under without-predict conditions to LOS F under with project conditions
during the weekday PM peak hour with approximately 43 additional seconds of delay. This
intersection could be improved with the installation of all-way stop-control. The Blaine Road /
Drayton Harbor Road intersection is anticipated to continue to operate at LOS F and a
southbound right turn lane would improve the operations to acceptable levels.


Site Access Analysis
The proposed project has two proposed accesses; the first via a new west leg of the
Semiahmoo Parkway/Gleneagle intersection and the second access along Semiahmoo
Drive/Drayton Harbor Road, west of the Semiahmoo Parkway / Semiahmoo Drive
intersection (see Figure 2).

As shown in Table 4 above, the proposed site accesses operate at LOS C or better under
with-project conditions during the weekday PM peak hour.

The potential need for left- and right-turn lanes were identified using Washington State
Department of Transportation (WSDOT) guidelines Exhibits1310-7a and 1310-11,
respectively, which are shown in Appendix D. A left-turn lane is not needed for capacity at
either site access per Exhibit 1310-7a as the total entering volumes are below 300 vehicles at
both site access intersections (see Figure 6) and left-turn volumes into the site accesses are


                                                                                                                      14

less than 30 vehicles, or less than 15 percent of the total volumes. Additionally, no right-turn
lane is recommended per Exhibit 1310-11 for the site accesses as the peak approach
(through plus right-turn) volumes at either site access are less than 100 vehicles with at most
25 right-turn vehicles.

Non-Motorized Facilities
The internal roadway through the project site would provide pedestrian and bicycle access to
and from Semiahmoo Drive and Semiahmoo Parkway and connection to the regional and
community trail system. Additionally, pedestrian and bicycle facilities would be provided
including connections to and from the Semiahmoo Spit.

As noted above under the planned improvements section, safety improvements to the
Semiahmoo Spit pedestrian path from the County Park to the Marina have been identified;
however, this is currently an unfunded project.

                                                  Mitigation
As discussed above, the Project would impact traffic operations at three study intersections
that operate below LOS D. Transportation impacts are proposed to be mitigated through
contributing their proportionate share toward the future improvement as these locations along
with the Peace Portal/Bell Road signalization project.

Table 5 provides detail related to the proposed mitigation measures for impacted locations
and how those improvements would improve levels of service.2.

                  Findings and Recommendations
General findings and recommendations of the transportation impact analysis are summarized
below.

          The proposed project would construct 44 single family dwelling units, 22 duplex
           units (equivalent to 44 single family dwelling units), 41 multi-family units, 5,000
           square-feet of retail, and 24,000 square-feet of storage providing 60 storage units.
           In addition, a 1.75-acre area of the site would either be constructed as City park or
           as residential including 7 single family dwelling units and 4 duplex units.

          The proposed residential project would generate approximately 138 to147 new
           weekday PM peak hour vehicular trips with approximately 84 to 90 inbound and 54
           to 57 outbound trips, depending on if the 1.75-acre area of the site is developed as
           a park or as residential, respectively.

          Access to the project site would be provided via two site accesses, one via a new
           west leg of the Semiahmoo Parkway/Gleneagle intersection and the other access
           along Semiahmoo Drive/Drayton Harbor Road, west of the Semiahmoo Parkway /
           Semiahmoo Drive intersection. Both site access intersections would operate at LOS
           C or better during the weekday PM peak hours and neither location meets left- or
           right-turn lane warrants.

          Mitigation would include paying the City’s transportation impact fees along with
           proportional share contributions to four intersection improvement projects.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
