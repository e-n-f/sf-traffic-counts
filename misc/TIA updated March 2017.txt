Transportation Impact Analysis
1200 Stewart Street                                                                    March 2017



                                      Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed-use project located at 1200 Stewart Street in the
Denny Triangle neighborhood of Seattle. As necessary, mitigation measures are identified
that would offset or reduce significant transportation related impacts that the project may
have on the surrounding transportation system.

This report focuses on the change in impacts between the previously approved project and
the current proposal, reflecting a 440-foot building height. The project as proposed and
approved in 2010 included 2 alternatives. The first alternative, and the alternative utilized for
comparative purposes in this report, included the 340 condominium units, a 252 room hotel,
21,634 square feet of retail, 5,104 square feet of restaurant, a 79,934 square foot health and
fitness club, 12,903 square feet of day care, and a 26,663 square foot social club. Alternative
2 included 546 condominium units, 21,634 square feet of retail, a 79,934 square foot health
and fitness club, 12,903 square feet of day care, and a 26,663 square foot social club.

The baseline 2021 conditions summarized in this report included traffic associated with the
1200 Stewart project as previously proposed and approved, the with-hotel alternative, as well
as a baseline condition without the previously approved project. The trip distribution and
assignment associated with the previously approved project was updated consistent with the
proposed project and recent project approvals in the area. This allows for a true comparison
and measure of the impacts between the previously approved project and land use as
compared to the current proposed project. The future (2021) with-project analysis includes
the update to the project description and resulting trip generation and compared to future
(2021) with 1200 Stewart as previously proposed and approved.

This report summarizes the results of the updated analysis reflecting a change in the
residential unit count as compared to the April 2016 TIA previously submitted to the City for
review. This report also outlines the potential project impacts assuming the current proposal
is limited in height to only 400 ft.


Project Description
As shown in Figure 1, the proposed project is located on the north side of Minor Avenue,
between Virginia Street and Stewart Street, in Seattle’s Denny Triangle neighborhood. The
proposed project would develop up to 1,050 residential apartment units with approximately
84,215 square feet of retail, 4,500 square feet of restaurant, and 27,000 square feet of health
and fitness club. The areas noted for commercial use excludes the common space
associated with the galleria as well as residential support areas which total approximately
36,457 square feet.

The proposed project would provide a total of approximately 735 parking spaces within an
underground parking garage. Access to the parking garage would be provided via a vehicle
access on Minor Avenue between Stewart Street and Denny Way. Figure 2 illustrates the
preliminary site plan. It is anticipated that the development would be constructed and
occupied by 2021.

The existing buildings and associated parking on the site would be removed as part of the
projects. The existing use consists of approximately 7,200 square-feet of retail, 20,760 sf of
office, and a public-pay parking lot with approximately 90 stalls.

Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with City of Seattle Department of Construction
and Inspections (SDCI) staff and is consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the
Denny Triangle area. Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed projects,
the following intersections were identified for analysis:
    1.   Westlake Avenue N/Denny Way                      8. Stewart Street/Denny Way/Yale
                                                             Avenue
    2. Fairview Avenue N/Denny Way
                                                          9. Eastlake Avenue E/John Street
    3. Fairview Avenue N/Boren Avenue
       (Virginia Street)                                  10. Boren Avenue/Howell Street
    4. Minor Avenue/Denny Way                             11. Minor Avenue/Howell Street
    5. Boren Avenue/Stewart Street                        12. Yale Avenue/Howell Street
    6. Minor Avenue/Stewart Street                        13. Bellevue Avenue/Denny Way
    7. Yale Avenue/Stewart Street

Additionally, the site access location on Minor Avenue was analyzed under future (2021)
with-project conditions. The study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour as directed by
SDCI staff. The report describes existing and future (2021) without-project conditions in the
vicinity of the project site. This includes the street system, existing and future without-project
weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized
facilities, and transit service. Future (2021) with-project conditions are then described. The
project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation system were identified by comparing the
future with-project conditions to the future without-project conditions.

Future
This section identifies specific transportation improvements that will affect the future Denny
Triangle transportation system.

Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2016 – 2021 Proposed Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) and WSDOT improvements, two street system transportation projects were
identified and are anticipated to be completed by 2021. Details related to these two roadway
projects in the study area are described below.
Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program is currently under construction and due to
delays WSDOT is reevaluating the schedule. This evaluation assumes the Viaduct would be
completed by 2018, the analysis horizon year. The project will provide a two-mile long tunnel
and connect S Royal Brougham Way in South Downtown to Mercer Street near the proposed


                                                                                                                           4

development project. The tunnel will replace the existing Alaskan Way Viaduct and Broad
Street tunnel and will connect to the existing SR 99 roadway on the north and south ends.
South of the site, the North Portal of SR 99 will be constructed, providing access to and from
SR 99 via Republican Street and Mercer Street/6th Avenue N.

Adaptive Signal Control Implementation is currently under construction as part of the
Mercer Corridor project. Phase 2 of the project includes 17 intersections along Denny Way.
The project would include implementation of adaptive signal controls in Seattle Center and
South Lake Union and supports integrated corridor management on Denny Way, Mercer
Street, and SR 99 north tunnel access. It is anticipated that the project would be completed
by the end of 2019.


Traffic Volumes
The following summarizes the traffic volumes for existing and future without-project
conditions.
Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection between March and September,
2015. Figure 3 illustrates the existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study
intersections, rounded to the nearest 5 vehicles. Detailed traffic counts are provided in
Appendix A.
Future
Future (2021) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying a 0.5 percent
annual background growth rate to the existing traffic volumes and adding in project trips from
known pipeline projects adjacent to the study area. Pipeline projects include projects that
have been permitted but are not yet constructed or occupied. Anticipated traffic volumes from
the following 41 pipeline projects were used to develop the future without-project traffic
volumes:

projects are shown on Figure 4. The future (2021) without-project true baseline volumes are
provided in Appendix B.

Due to the current status of the environmental review for the proposed Washington State
Convention Center (WSCC) Addition, this project was not included in the pipeline list.
Instead, a cumulative impacts section has been added to the project impacts section to
identify the future conditions with the traffic associated with the WSCC Addition.


Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour
of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection. Traffic
operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service
(LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix C contains a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of
the intersections. Under future 2021 conditions, signal timing maximum splits were optimized.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2021) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized in Table
2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix D.

As shown in Table 2, the study area intersections currently operate at LOS D or better with
the exception of three intersections. The Yale Avenue/Stewart Street intersection currently
operates at LOS E, and the Minor Avenue/Denny Way and Yale Avenue/Howell Street
intersections currently operate at LOS F. Due to the configuration of the Minor
Avenue/Denny Way intersection, the south legs of Minor Avenue and Virginia Street were
analyzed as a single stop-controlled approach to conform with HCM methodology.

Under future (2021) conditions, without or with consideration of the previously approved 1200
Stewart project, reflective of the updated trip distribution and assignment, the study
intersections are anticipated to primarily experience substantial increases in delay due to the
increase in traffic volumes from pipeline projects. Under future (2021) without-project
conditions LOS at five intersections are expected to degrade due to the increase in traffic
volumes. The Minor Avenue/Denny Way and Yale Avenue/Howell Street intersections are
anticipated to continue operate at LOS F. The Stewart Street/Denny Way intersection is
anticipated to degrade to LOS E under future (2021) without-project conditions. The Yale
Avenue/Stewart Street intersection is anticipated to improve to LOS D under future (2021)
without-project conditions.

Under future (2021) with the previously approved project, the study area intersections are
anticipated to operate at the same LOS as under future (2021) without-project conditions with
the exception of two. With addition of the previously approved traffic, the Westlake Avenue
N/Denny Way intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS C to LOS D and the Stewart
Street/Denny Way intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS E to LOS F.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from
the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2012
and December 31, 2014. In addition to the study intersections, collision data along the
Fairview Avenue, Virginia Street, Boren Avenue, Minor Avenue, Stewart Street, Howell
Street, Denny Way corridors in the study area were analyzed to evaluate the vehicle,
pedestrian and bicycle safety conditions. This information is summarized in Table 3.

SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The SDOT
reviews collision records for signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a year,



                                                                                                                  10

unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, and locations with 5 or more pedestrian
or bike collisions. SDOT’s Candidate Locations for 2015 High Collision Location Reviews did
not include any study intersections that met the standards above that would require review or
monitoring. One intersection, Denny Way / Stewart Street was listed on the pedestrian
location list due to having 4 pedestrian collisions in the previous year. This intersection was
reviewed by SDOT in 2012 with additional signage placed to alert drivers to yield to
pedestrians when completing turns.

A review of the roadway segments indicates that an average of 4 or less collisions per year
occurred along the adjacent corridors. Further review of the collision data indicates no
reported fatalities in the study area, 3 bicycle-related collisions, and 19 pedestrian-related
collisions. Upon review, of the bicycle-related collisions, most occurred during the day with
wet road conditions whereas the pedestrian-related collisions occurred most frequently during
dry, daylight conditions.


Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.
Existing
Sidewalks are provided on all streets in the study area with marked crosswalk at the
signalized study intersections. Bicycle facilities within the study area are limited with shared
lane markings provided on Stewart Street and Howell Street.

The proposed development is located within the Pronto Cycleshare service area. The nearest
bike station is located at Terry Avenue/Stewart Street, approximately one block from the
project. The Pronto service area currently provides users with short-term bicycle rental in a
service area spanning from Pioneer Square to the University District between the Waterfront
and Capitol Hill. Cycleshare can be used an alternate commuting mode or providing a link to
other transit services.
Future
In the immediate vicinity of the site, according to the Adopted Seattle Bicycle Master Plan,
April 2014, protected bike lanes are recommended along Eastlake Avenue and Stewart
Street as part of the Citywide network. This will increase the connectivity by bicycle of
neighborhoods located north of downtown to the CBD as well as providing safe bicycle routes
for tenant of the proposed development to these areas.


Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.
Existing
Bus transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro, Sound Transit, and
the City of Seattle Streetcar. The nearest bus stops are located along Denny Way at Yale
Avenue and Stewart Street, approximately 300-feet east (or a 1- to 2-minute walk) from the
project site. Additional bus stops are also located to the northwest along Denny Way at
Fairview Avenue and to the southwest along Boren Avenue at Virginia Street. Within one
block of the proposed development, transit service is provided to destinations within Seattle
as well as the whole Puget Sound region including Snohomish County, the Eastside and
Pierce County.

Additionally, a South Lake Union Streetcar stop is located along Westlake Avenue at 9th
Avenue approximately 0.4 miles (or an 8- to 9-minute walk) from the project site and the

Convention Place Station, providing access to the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (DSTT)
is located within one-quarter mile.
Future
With the closure of the DSTT to buses by 2021 to accommodate future light-rail service to
Northgate and Snohomish County, the Convention Place Station (CPS) would close. Buses
using this station would be rerouted to use surface street alternatives with changes to transit
routing likely to provide direct access to Link Stations. Detailed service changes for 2021 are
not known at this time.

                                    Project Impacts
This section of the report documents the project’s impacts on the surrounding street system
and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic generated by the proposed project are
distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within the study area for the
weekday PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-project traffic volumes
and the potential impacts to traffic operations, safety, transit, and non-motorized facilities are
identified. An additional cumulative impacts section as included to evaluate traffic operations
within the study area with the proposed Washington State Convention Center (WSCC)
Addition which is currently under review.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site. The net new trips generated takes into
account the current trips on the network, which are being generated by the existing uses on-
site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then estimating
the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level
of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




Total person trips were developed for the existing and proposed uses based on trip rates
from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. For the proposed land uses Apartment (LU

#220) was utilized for the residential component, Shopping Center (LU #820) was utilized for
retail, High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant (LU #932) for restaurant, and Health and Fitness
Club (LU #492) was utilized for the health/fitness component of the development. Due to the
size and variety of uses anticipated for the retail component of the development the Shopping
Center land use was utilized as opposed to specialty retail which is usually smaller. Based on
the existing land uses Specialty Retail (LU #826) was utilized for the retail components and
Single Tenant Office Building (LU #715) was utilized for the existing office use. Single tenant
and specialty retail uses were selected due to the smaller sizes of the existing uses. Average
vehicle occupancy (AVO) was estimated from the Trip Generation Manual for the existing
single tenant office (#715) and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program
(NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed
residential apartments.

Residential person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the
total person trips by the estimated mode splits from the US Census 2010-2014 American
Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting Characteristics.1 The survey shows a 35
percent auto mode split for census tract 73 where the project is located. After applying the
auto mode split, residential person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by
assuming an AVO of 1.15.2

The Commute Seattle’s 2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split report summarizes Commute
Trip Reduction (CTR) data by Seattle neighborhood. The data shows, for the South Lake
Union neighborhood, 58 percent of employee trips were made by auto (45 percent single
occupancy vehicles and 13 percent carpool/vanpool), 27 percent by transit, and 15 percent
walking, biking, or other modes. After applying the auto mode split, office person trips were
then converted back to vehicle trips by using average vehicle occupancies of 1.12.3

Appendix E provides the detailed trip generation calculation. Table 4 summarizes the
estimated weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed and
existing land uses.

As shown in Table 4, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 4,135 net
new weekday daily vehicle trips with 240 net new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and
363 net new vehicle trips during the PM peak hour. As proposed in 2010 the project was
anticipated to approximately 289 AM peak hour trips and 417 PM peak hour trips under the
with-hotel alternative, and approximately 190 AM peak hour trips and 303 PM peak hour trips
under the without-hotel alternative. As previously proposed under the with-hotel alternative
the 2010 project is anticipated to generate more AM and PM peak hour trips than currently
proposed.

400-Foot Alternative
In addition to the proposed 440-foot building alternative described above, a 400-foot building
alternative was considered. This alternative would construct up to 964 apartment units, a
reduction of approximately 86 apartment units of the above analysis. The 400-foot building
alternative would result in approximately 3,965 net new weekday daily vehicle trips with 226
net new vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 347 net new vehicle trips during the PM
peak hour. Impacts are discussed below for the 440-foot building alternative; however, for the
400-foot alternative, impacts (operationally and in terms of mitigation fees) are anticipated to
be similar to slightly less than compared with the 440-foot alternative.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based on guidance
from the Director’s Rule 5-2009, OnTheMap, as well as a review of existing travel patterns,
planned improvements, and previous studies conducted in the area.

OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more

1200 Stewart Street                                                                                        March 2017


likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the expected inbound and outbound project vehicle trip
distribution for the proposed project, respectively, to the surrounding local and regional street
system. The weekday PM peak hour trips were assigned to the study area based on the
travel patterns shown on Figure 5 and Figure 6 and the location of the site access. The
project would provide access via a driveway on Minor Avenue. The distribution and
assignment considers the primary travel routes within the gridded street system where project
impacts would be greatest. It is recognized that drivers may take alternative routes; however,
it is anticipated that impacts along these facilities would be less than disclosed in this
analysis.

The project traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes
to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2021 with-project traffic volumes
are shown on Figure 7.

Traffic Volume Impact
Table 5 summarizes the project traffic volume impact at the study intersections during the
weekday PM peak hour for the project site as compared to the without-project conditions not
containing the previously proposed and approved 1200 Stewart project.

As shown in the table, the percent traffic volume impacts are relatively low even in the site
vicinity and range from approximately 1 to 5 percent at the study intersections, with the
exception of the Minor Avenue/Stewart Street and Yale Avenue/Stewart Street intersections
which are approximately 15 and 8 percent, respectively. These intersections are located
nearest the site and provide access to the site via I-5. Overall the project volume impacts
identified at the study intersections are within the range of daily fluctuations in traffic, which
can be up to 5 percent.

Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as described for
existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters such as
channelization and traffic control were consistent with those used in the evaluation of future
without-project conditions. A comparison of future without and with-project weekday PM peak
hour traffic operations is summarized for the project site in Table 7. Detailed LOS worksheets
are provided in Appendix D.

Typically, the City does not consider an impact at intersections operating at LOS E or F, or if
an intersection degrades beyond LOS D, significant if it is a less than 5 second increase in
delay. Overall, most intersections would continue to operate at the same LOS as under future
(2021) without-project conditions with minimal increases and in some cases decreases in
delay. As indicated in Table 7, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be
minimal with little to no change in calculated delays or LOS, with the exception of the Stewart
Street/Denny Way intersection under future (2021) without-project conditions. The Stewart
Street/Denny Way intersection is anticipated to operate at the same LOS under future (2021)
with previously approved project as the currently proposed project.

The Stewart Street/Denny Way intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS F with more than
a 5 second increase in delay as compared to future (2021) without-project conditions, and no
increase in delay as compared to the previously approved project with the updated trip
distribution and assignment. The Stewart Street/Denny Way intersection was identified as an
impact in the 1200 Stewart Mixed-Use Development.4 The project would be required to
contribute to the SDOT Active Traffic Control program for the Denny Way corridor which
would include the Stewart Street/Denny Way intersection. At the Minor Avenue/Denny Way

intersection it is likely that certain turning movements would be restricted or drivers would
take alternate routes through signalized intersections if they experience excessive delay.

Cumulative Impacts Analysis
With the pending application of the Washington State Convention Center (WSCC) Addition
located at Boren Avenue/Olive Way, cumulative impacts of the proposed project were
evaluated. Future without-project horizon year traffic volumes were developed using the
same methodology as previously described with the addition of project trips from the WSCC
Addition and its associated planned co-development. Project trips from this proposal were
then added to the new future without-project traffic volumes as described in the Traffic
Volume Impact section.

The LOS at the study intersections was then evaluated for future without-project conditions
and with-project conditions to determine the relative impact of this development proposal
using the same methodologies as previously described. A summary of the LOS is included in
Table 8. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 8, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with no changes in LOS from without-project to with-project conditions at intersections
operating at LOS D or worse. As previously described Stewart Street/Denny Way intersection
would experience vehicle delay increases greater than 5 seconds under future (2021)
without-project but has less than a 5 second increase when compared to future (2021) with
previously approved project conditions. As is the case of other development projects in SLU,
the developer of this project would be required to contribute a pro-rata contribution to the
SDOT Active Traffic Control program for the Denny Way corridor in order to mitigate for
project related impacts.

Site Access Evaluation
Parking for the proposed project would be provided via a below grade garage. Access to the
garage would be provided via a driveway along Minor Avenue. Minor Avenue operates with
two-way traffic. The site access is anticipated to operate at LOS B following completion of the
proposed project, both with or without the cumulative addition of traffic from the WSCC
Addition.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include South of Lake Union
(Screenline 8) and South of S Jackson Street (Screenline 10.11), as shown in Table 9. As a
conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the
direction of the screenlines would extend across the screenlines included in this analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
demand of the project, and parking code requirements.
Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided in an underground parking garage with a
total of 735 stalls. Of the 735 parking stalls, 128 stalls would be available for non-residential
uses (retail and health and fitness club) and the remaining 607 stalls would be reserved for
the residential use. Access to the parking garage would be provided via a vehicle access on
Minor Avenue between Stewart Street and Denny Way.
Demand
The peak parking demand is expected to be below national averages due the project’s
proximity to transit service and its location in the Denny Triangle. South Lake Union and the




                                                                                                                        23

CBD would be easily accessible by transit and walking and provide a strong mix of office,
residential, and commercial spaces.

The peak parking demand for the proposed project was estimated based on data provided in
ITE Parking Generation (4th Edition), local mode of travel data consistent with the trip
generation analysis, and local vehicle ownership data.5 This approach is consistent with
approved traffic studies conducted in the vicinity of the site. Detailed calculations are
provided in Appendix F.

The site is located in census tract 73; the majority of this area is located west of I-5, north of
Denny Way predominately in the South Lake Union neighborhood. The parking demand rate
based on the US Census Bureau vehicle ownership information from 2010 to 2014 is higher
than anticipated parking demand rates in the area due to the rapid development of high-
density office and residential projects. It is anticipated that vehicle ownership in the area
would decrease with recent or planned improvements in transit, car share opportunities, and
multimodal infrastructure as well as do the increase in complementing mixed-uses including
grocery stores, restaurants, office buildings and residential buildings.

It is anticipated that vehicle ownership for the proposed development would be similar to the
existing US Census Bureau vehicle ownership rates found in Census Tract 82. This Census
Tract is located is south of Olive Way and west of I-5 which provides similar land uses to
those anticipated to develop in the Denny Triangle area where the project is located. An
analysis was completed to estimate the approximate on-site parking demand of the proposed
development using the vehicle ownership rates from this Census Tract.

Residential Parking Demand. The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand
for the apartments (0.42 vehicles per unit) is based on average vehicle ownership6 from US
Census data and the proposed mix of apartment units.7

       Table 10. Estimated Peak Parking Demand – US Census Data: Census Tract 82
                                                                                      Localized Peak Parking

       Note: du = dwelling units
       Reflects traffic associated with a proposal with a 440’ height limitation


As shown in Table 10, the peak parking demand associated with the residential tenants is
anticipated to be approximately 441 vehicles and would occur overnight. The proposed
residential supply of 607 spaces would accommodate the anticipated demand and could
result in a surplus of approximately 166 stalls. In addition to the on-site parking demand, it is
recognized that some visitors to the residential tenants would likely generate parking
demand. It is anticipated that residential guests would utilize street parking in the area. It
should be noted however, that the anticipated surplus in the parking garage could
accommodate residential guests as well depending on the location of the residential access
control.

Non-Residential Parking Demand. The parking rates used to estimate the peak parking
demand for the non-residential components are based on the ITE Parking Generation
suburban rates for a shopping center (#820), high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant (#932), and

health and fitness club (#492). The vehicle mode split was assumed to be the same as used
to estimate weekday PM peak hour trip generation (50 percent by vehicle for shopping center
and restaurant, and 35 percent by vehicle for health and fitness club).

Based on the proposed land uses and mode split, a parking rate of 1.28 vehicles per 1,000
square-feet was used for the shopping center land use, a rate of 2.78 vehicles per 1,000
square-feet of restaurant, and a parking rate of 1.84 vehicles per 1,000 square-feet was used
for the health and fitness club. This results in a peak parking demand of approximately 108
associated with the retail use, 13 associated with the restaurant use, and 50 vehicles
associated with the health and fitness club, totaling 171 vehicles. The retail, restaurant, and
health club uses are not anticipated to peak at the same time. Figure 8 shows the anticipated
parking demand by time of day based on the proposed land uses.

As shown in Figure 8 the peak shared parking demand is anticipated to be 142 vehicles and
would not be accommodated in the total proposed supply of 128 stalls. The commercial
portion of the project could result in a spillover of approximately 14 vehicles but could be
accommodated in the residential supply depending on the location of the security gate.

Displaced Parking
The project would displace 91 public parking spaces on the proposed project site. The
anticipated cumulative parking effects with-project development and displacement of parking
are summarized in Table 11.

1.   Study radius based on the nature of daily retail parking and overnight residential parking.
2.   Available parking for midday based on SDOT 2014 Annual Paid Parking Study.


As shown in Table 11, both the anticipated midday and overnight displaced vehicles could be
accommodated on-street. The cumulative increase in parking demand relative to
neighborhood supply would continue to add pressure to mode split choices for all
transportation coming to the South Lake Union area. This is consistent with the City of Seattle
overall goals associated with commute-related travel to the City and the increasing focus on
alternative travel modes.

Parking Code Analysis
This section outlines the parking code requirements for vehicular and bicycle parking.

Off-Street Vehicle Parking
Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there is no minimum parking requirement the
development as the project is located within the Denny Triangle urban center. However, the
proposed project would be provided in an underground parking garage with a total of 735
stalls.

Bicycle Parking
Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

SMC Section 23.49.019, Table A outlines the bicycle parking siting and quantity
requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for residential,
retail, and office uses. For the purpose bicycle parking, shopping center (#820), restaurant
(#932), and health and fitness club (#492) are considered retail uses. Required bicycle
parking rate is reduced in half after the first 50 parking spaces provided per land use. The
bicycle parking requirements are shown in Table 12.




                                                                                                                       26

project is proposing to supply 247 residential bicycle parking spaces and 31 retail bicycle
parking spaces, which would not meet the required bicycle parking supply or meet code
requirements.

                       Mitigation and Recommendations
The proposed project would construct frontage improvements along Minor Avenue, Yale
Avenue, and Stewart Street. These frontage improvements would fully integrate with the non-
motorized facilities along the corridor. In addition, the project impacts to the surrounding
transportation system would be mitigated through the project’s pro-rata contribution to the
Seattle Department of Transportation’s (SDOT) Active Traffic Control program for the Denny
Way corridor. Additional detail on mitigation measures is provided below.

As shown in Table 13, based on the pro-rata share the project would be required to
contribute approximately $27,337 to SDOT’s proposed Active Traffic Control project for the
Denny Way corridor. This contribution is based on preliminary cost estimates from SDOT.


South Lake Union Transportation Mitigation Payment
Additionally, to mitigate impacts of the proposal on the surrounding transportation system, the
developer would be required to pay the South Lake Union transportation mitigation payment.
The City has implemented a program in and around the South Lake Union neighborhood that
requires new developments to contribute towards planned improvements identified in the
South Lake Union Transportation Plan. Improvements in this transportation plan include a
combination of vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects located in the neighborhood
which would benefit all users.

The development mitigation payment schedule is set forth by DPD’s Client Assistance Memo
243 – Transportation Mitigation Payments. The developer is opting to pay based on a pro-
rata share calculation, which is based on the number of weekday PM peak hour trips using
the South Lake Union infrastructure. This mitigation fee is estimated to be $14,789, as shown
in Appendix G. This fee is a preliminary calculation and would be finalized by the City upon
issuance of the decision on the proposed project.

These fees are reflect the contributions assuming a 440’ tower project. If the project were
reduced in height to 400’ the fees would decrease accordingly.

Transportation Impact Analysis
1200 Stewart Street                                                                        March 2017



                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with of the mixed-use
development located at 1200 Stewart Street in the Denny Triangle neighborhood of Seattle.
General findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would construct 1,050 residential apartment units, 84,215
           square feet of retail, 4,500 square feet of restaurant, and 27,000 square feet of
           health and fitness club.
          After accounting for the existing uses on the project site, the development is
           anticipated to generate 4,135 net new vehicular weekday daily trips with 240
           net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 363 net new trips
           during the PM peak hour.
          Relative to the current approval for this site, the current plan represents a 49 trip
           decrease in AM trip generation and a 54 trip reduction in PM trip generation.
          The off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at similar LOS during the
           2021 horizon year with or without the addition of project related trips with the
           exception of one intersection. The Stewart Street/Denny Way intersection is
           anticipated to operate at LOS F with an increase in delay greater than 5 seconds
           when compared to future (2021) conditions and less than 5 seconds when
           compared to future (2021) with previously approved project conditions. Due to the
           grid network in the study area, it is likely that drivers would find alternative routes or
           alter their time of travel if they experience long delays at this location.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via a driveway along
           Minor Avenue. The site access on Minor Avenue is anticipated to operate at LOS B
           during the PM peak hour.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The parking supply for the proposed project is 735 vehicle parking stalls. Given the
           availability of alternative modes of travel within the site vicinity including transit and
           bicycle facilities as well as the large amount of employment opportunities, it is likely
           that the site would tend towards lower auto ownership characteristic of higher
           density residential as seen in areas near the project. Based on anticipated future
           parking demand rates, the peak parking demand associated with the residential
           component of the project could be accommodate the on-site and the commercial
           component could result in an overspill of approximately 10 vehicles.
          Displaced parking associated with development of the proposed project could be
           accommodated on-street.
          The developer would be required to pay a transportation mitigation fee. The
           mitigation fee is estimated to be $27,337 based on the project’s calculated pro-rata
           share, as well as $14,789 to the South Lake Union transportation mitigation
           program.
