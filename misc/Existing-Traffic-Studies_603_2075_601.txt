Memorandum
Date:           April 20, 2016
To:             Mr. Andrew Lavaux, The Pauls Corporation
From:           Gary Black, Rueben Rodriguez
Subject:        603 Jefferson, Redwood City, California - Traffic Study Addendum - Intersection
                Turning Movement Data Comparison

This memorandum serves as an addendum to the Traffic Study prepared by Hexagon
Transportation Consultants, Inc. on April 6, 2016 for the proposed mixed-use development at 603
Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City, California. This memorandum compares newly collected
intersection turning movement counts to the year 2010 existing conditions counts presented in the
Redwood City Downtown Precise Plan (DTPP). The purpose of this analysis is to establish whether
the transportation impact conclusions from the DTPP are still valid and to determine if changes in
traffic conditions within the downtown would likely result in a new significant impact.

Project Information
The project site is located at the southeast corner of Jefferson Avenue and Bradford Street, and is
approximately 0.5 acres. The project area falls within the plan area of the Redwood City Downtown
Precise Plan (DTPP). Currently the existing site includes a single-story commercial building. The
proposed project would demolish the existing building and construct an 8-story apartment building
with ground floor commercial space. The project would include 92 apartments above approximately
4,500 square feet of commercial space.

Data Collection
On Tuesday, March 15, 2016 and Tuesday, April 12, 2016, new manual turning movement counts
were collected for three study intersections during the AM peak hour, typically between 7:00-9:00
AM, and PM peak hour, typically between 4:00-6:00 PM. The three study intersections are listed
below.
      1. Jefferson Avenue and Veterans Boulevard
      2. Main Street and Veterans Boulevard
      3. Main Street and Bradford Street
The intersection turning movement counts are provided in Attachment 1.
603 Jefferson, Redwood City, CA - Traffic Study                                           April 20, 2016


Intersection Turning Movement Data Comparison
The new counts were compared to the Existing 2010 conditions traffic volumes and Cumulative
2030 traffic volumes in the DTPP. Table 1 and Table 2 present the results from the AM peak hour
traffic analysis. Table 3 and Table 4 present the results from the PM peak hour traffic analysis. The
peak hour volume comparisons are discussed below.
AM Volume Summary
As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the 2016 AM peak hour traffic volumes are lower than the 2010
data. The 2016 traffic volumes at the intersection of Jefferson Avenue/Veterans Boulevard are
approximately 1,000 vehicles less than the 2010 data. The Main Street/Veterans Boulevard
intersection shows a decrease of approximately 550 vehicles between the 2016 and 2010 data. The
Main Street/Boulevard 2016 traffic volume is approximately 30 vehicles less than the 2010 traffic
volume. Based on this comparison, there is no evidence that there is any change in circumstances
that would require altering the LOS conclusions presented in the DTPP.
PM Volume Summary
As shown in Table 3 and Table 4, the 2016 PM peak hour traffic volumes are lower than the 2010
data. The 2016 traffic volumes at the intersection of Jefferson Avenue/Veterans Boulevard are
approximately 1,000 vehicles less than the 2010 data. The Main Street/Veterans Boulevard
intersection shows a decrease of approximately 800 vehicles between the 2016 and 2010 data. The
Main Street/Boulevard 2016 traffic volume is approximately 100 vehicles less than the 2010 traffic
volume. Based on this comparison, there is no evidence that there is any change in circumstances
that would require altering the LOS conclusions presented in the DTPP.

    1.0	 Proposed	Improvements	Summary	
    The proposed improvements at the 2075 Broadway project site (Project) include the construction of a 
    four‐story mixed use building, comprised of 80,000 sq ft of office space and 13,515 sq ft of retail space.  
    The building will also include two subterranean levels of parking providing a total of 197 parking stalls.  It 
    should be noted that 47 of the total stall count are proposed to be provided using a valet or parking 
    assist program.   


    1.1	 Overview	of	Analysis	to	Date		
    SANDIS has completed a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) for the Project relative to the City’s 
    Downtown Precise Plan (DTPP) as requested.  Our evaluation compared trip forecast to be generated by 
    the Project to the trips forecast as part of the overall DTPP development.  The comparison identified any 
    inconsistencies between the two and what the likely impact would be.  In addition, the TIA provides an 
    overview of the existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities linking the Project to the Sequoia Station 
    Caltrain Station, a queuing analysis for the northbound approach of the Broadway/Jefferson 
    intersection, and a sight distance analysis of the Project driveway. Lastly, a TDM for the project was 
    prepared.     


    1.2	 Intent	of	Comparison	and	Evaluation	Criteria	
    The intent of this comparison is to determine if the transportation impact results from the Down Town 
    Precise Plan (DTPP) are valid when compared to the newly collected 2016 data. This report identifies any 
    changes in morning and afternoon peak traffic volumes at intersections within the Project vicinity and 
    what impacts, if any, these changes could have to the level of service (LOS) of the respective 
    intersection.   A new significant impact is defined as an intersection degrading to below an LOS of D 
    (DTPP EIR, Page 9‐37).

    Five of the seven intersections examined in this study exhibited higher AM Peak volumes for the 2016 
    data in comparison to the 2010 data.  The increased volumes varied from 31 to 159 additional vehicles.  
    A comparison of the 2010 and 2016 data is presented in Table 2. The intersections that exhibited higher

    The two remaining intersections exhibited lower traffic volumes than the 2010 volumes.  These 
    decreased volumes ranged from 35 (Broadway/Middlefield Rd) to 176 (El Camino Real/Jefferson Ave) 
    fewer vehicles.  The volumes for all intersections were below the DTPP’s projected 2030 volumes 

    Marshall St/ Jefferson Avenue (#1): 

    The 2016 AM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 153 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    in the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic is the Eastbound 
    through movement which increased by 101 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are reasonable and 
    expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple travel routes are 
    possible. 

    The DTPP EIR forecast that in 2010 during the AM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS B with 
    19.2 seconds of delay. Given the additional vehicle trips documented in the 2016 count, it is possible 
    that the intersection is operating at a LOS C during the AM peak.   LOS C is considered an acceptable 
    level of service.  

    Marshall St/ Main St (#2): 

    The 2016 AM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 156 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic was the Westbound 
    through movement which increased by approximately 112 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are 
    reasonable and expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple 
    travel routes are possible. 

    The DTPP EIR found that in 2010 during the AM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS B with 13.3 
    seconds of delay. Based on the data collected in 2016 and the additional trips as compared to the 2010 
    data, it is estimated that the intersection is functioning at a LOS B with a slightly higher average delay 
    than what was identified in the DTPP.  

    Broadway/ Jefferson Ave (#4): 

    The 2016 AM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 159 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic was the Southbound 
    through movement which increased by approximately 54 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are 
    reasonable and expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple 
    travel routes are possible.

    The DTPP EIR found that in 2010 during the AM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS A with 8.0 
    seconds of delay. Given the additional vehicle trips in the 2016 data, it is possible that the intersection is 
    currently operating at a LOS B with an average delay of 10 seconds or slightly higher.  LOS B is an 
    acceptable level of service.    

    Broadway / Main St (#5): 

    The 2016 AM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 44 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  This increase was generally distributed amongst several movements with no clear 
    movement being the primary contributor to the increase.  Fluctuations of this order are reasonable and 
    expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple travel routes are 
    possible.  

    The DTPP EIR found that in 2010 during the AM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS A with 9.7 
    seconds of delay. Given that the intersection is operating at close to a LOS B, it is likely that the 
    additional 2016 trips, albeit a small increase, would increase the LOS of this intersection to B.  LOS B is 
    an acceptable level of service.    

    Middlefield Rd/ Jefferson Ave (#6): 

    The 2016 AM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 31 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic was the Westbound 
    through movement which increased by approximately 62 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are 
    reasonable and expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple 
    travel routes are possible. 

    The DTPP EIR found that in 2010 during the AM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS C with 25.6 
    seconds of delay.  Based on the 2016 data, the intersection is anticipated to continue to operate at a 
    LOS C, which is an acceptable level of service.

    2.2	PM	Volume	Summary	
    Three of the seven intersections examined in this study exhibited higher PM Peak volumes for the 2016 
    data in comparison to the 2010 data.  The increased volumes varied from 2 to 27 additional vehicles.  A 
    comparison of the 2010 and 2016 data is presented in Table 3.  The intersections that exhibited higher 
    2016 volumes include: 

              Marshall St/ Jefferson Ave (#1): Approximately 9 vehicles higher 
              Marshall St/ Main St (#2): Approximately 2 vehicles higher 
              Broadway/Middlefield Rd (#3): Approximately 27 vehicles higher 

    The four remaining intersections exhibited lower traffic volumes than the 2010 volumes.  These 
    decreased volumes ranged from 39 to 904 fewer vehicles.  The volumes for all intersections were below 
    the DTPP’s projected 2030 volumes. 

    Marshall St/ Jefferson Avenue (#1): 

    The 2016 PM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 9 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic was the Eastbound 
    through movement which increased by approximately 90 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are 
    reasonable and expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple 
    travel routes are possible. 

    The DTPP EIR forecast that in 2010 during the PM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS C with 
    20.1 seconds of delay. Given the minimal increase of vehicle trips between the 2016 and 2010 data, the 
    intersection is anticipated to currently be operating at a LOS C.   

    Marshall St/ Main St (#2): 

    The 2016 PM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 2 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic was the Eastbound 
    right turn movement which increased by approximately 130 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are 
    reasonable and expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple 
    travel routes are possible. 

    The DTPP EIR found that in 2010 during the PM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS B with 14.9 
    seconds of delay. Given that the intersection was found to be functioning at a LOS B with an average 
    delay on the cusp of causing it to be classified as LOS C, it is possible that based on the 2016 data, the 
    intersection is currently operating at a LOS C.  LOS C is considered an acceptable level of service.   

    Broadway/ Middlefield Rd (#3): 

    The 2016 PM Peak hour traffic volume for this intersection is 27 vehicles greater than the 2010 volume 
    from the DTPP EIR.  The movement which displayed the greatest increase in traffic was the Southbound

    left turn movement which increased by approximately 63 vehicles.  Fluctuations of this order are 
    reasonable and expected for intersections located within a City's downtown system where multiple 
    travel routes are possible. 

    The DTPP EIR found that in 2010 during the PM Peak hour the intersection operated at a LOS A with 8.4 
    seconds of delay. Given the minor increase in overall trips between the 2010 and 2016 data, the

Subject:          Intersection Turning Movement Data Comparison for 601 Marshall Street
                  Office Development in Redwood City, California

                                                                                                       SJ14-1529


This memorandum documents Fehr & Peers’ data collection efforts for the proposed office
development at 601 Marshall Street in Redwood City, California. Specifically, this memorandum
compares newly collected intersection turning movement counts to the year 2010 existing
            1
conditions counts presented in the Downtown Precise Plan (DTPP) Environmental Impact Report
      2
(EIR) . The purpose of this comparison is to establish whether the transportation impact
conclusions from the DTPP EIR are still valid; or if changes in traffic conditions within the
downtown would likely result in new significant intersection impacts. A new significant
intersection impact is defined in the DTPP EIR as an impact that would degrade an intersection to
below acceptable LOS D (see DTPP EIR p. 9-37).


SUMMARY

The 2015 total intersection volumes for each of the eight locations are on average about 40
vehicles higher than the existing conditions described in the DTPP EIR and about 600 vehicles
lower than the 2030 cumulative projections from the DTPP EIR. The increase in vehicle trips over
time, such as has been experienced between 2010 and 2015, was anticipated in the cumulative
impacts discussion in DTPP EIR, which anticipated significant growth in traffic volumes between
2010 and 2030. The growth to date is well within the cumulative projects analysis in the EIR. There
is no evidence that there is any change in circumstances that would require altering the LOS
conclusions presented in the DTPP EIR.

BACKGROUND

Fehr & Peers prepared a focused Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) for the proposed office
development in September 2015. The focused TIA included trip generation estimates for the
project and presented a qualitative assessment of how these trips would affect operations at eight
nearby intersections that were studied as part of the DTPP EIR. Specifically, the assessment relied
on the level of service (LOS) and intersection delay calculations for the Year 2030 Cumulative Plus
Project scenario developed for the DTPP. The DTPP EIR estimated that intersections within the
downtown core would operate at LOS C or better. The focused TIA concluded that the proposed
office development would likely have a minimal to moderate effect on intersection operations
within the downtown and would, in general, not likely warrant modifications to the existing traffic
controls and/or signal operations.

The Focused TIA determined that the existing traffic controls and/or operations at the Jefferson
Avenue intersections at Middlefield and El Camino Real would potentially warrant modifications
and off-setting pedestrian and bicycle mitigations were identified for the project. The project
applicant is working with Redwood City staff to implement these pedestrian and bicycle
improvements.

It should be noted that the focused TIA presented a conservative analysis, since the project is
within the development envelop of DTPP that was analyzed in 2010. Additionally, the assessment
did not apply any vehicle trip reductions for transit use or reductions for the Transportation
Demand Management program required of the project.

Since the Focused TIA relied on information presented in the DTPP EIR, intersection turning
movement data was collected in July, 2015 to establish that the traffic impact conclusions from
the DTPP EIR are still valid for the evaluation of the 601 Marshall Street project.


DATA COLLECTION

Downtown Redwood City and the surrounding area has seen a considerable increase in
development over the last few years and the purpose of the data collection is to verify that the
EIR’s growth projections, and associated intersection LOS results, are still valid. As noted above,
today’s traffic volumes are higher than existing conditions measured between 2008 and 2010, but
this growth in traffic volumes was expected and anticipated in the DTPP EIR.

Fehr & Peers collected morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM) peak period
vehicle turning movement counts at the eight intersections evaluated as part of the September

Focused TIA. Intersection turning movement counts were collected on Wednesday, July 22, 2015.
It should be noted that these counts were collected during the summer, when schools are not in
session and traffic volumes are generally lower. To account for this, the July data was increased by
ten percent. The adjusted morning and evening peak hour turning movement volumes are
presented in Table 1.

The downtown’s circulation patterns are affected by several on-going construction activities,
which result in diversion of traffic to new routing patterns or intersections with less construction
activity. Re-routing the turning movement volumes to account for the current construction
activities would be very difficult; thus no adjustments to the counts were made to account for
construction activities. It should be noted that, the southbound approach at the Middlefield
Road/Jefferson Avenue intersection (#7) was blocked due to construction, so no southbound
traffic was observed on Jefferson Avenue at this location.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

The purpose of the data collection is to establish the validity of the conclusions from the DTPP EIR
and determine if the cumulative increases in traffic in the plan area are within the envelope of
expected change assumed in the EIR. If the volumes are within the envelope of the analysis, it is
unlikely than there would be any new intersection impacts. To make this determination we
conducted the following five steps:

    1.   Compare Existing Data: We compared the turning movement data from 2015 to the 2010
         data to determine how traffic volumes have changed in the past five years.
    2.   Compare Growth Projections: We compared the 2015 data to 2030 projected traffic
         volumes to determine whether the 2015 data continues to be within the envelope of the
         year 2030 cumulative projections.
    3.   Assess Existing and Cumulative Conditions LOS: Based on the results in Step 1 and 2, we
         establish how changes in the 2015 data would potentially change the DTPP Existing and
         Cumulative Conditions LOS estimates.
    4.   Assess Cumulative Plus Project LOS: Based on the results in Step 3, we establish how the
         DTPP Cumulative Plus Project LOS could change.
    5.   Determine if there are Additional Impacts: Based on Step 4 evaluate if there would be
         additional impacts not identified in the DTPP EIR. The LOS threshold of significance for
         both signalized and unsignalized intersection impacts within Redwood City is LOS D.

It should also be noted that this analysis presents a conservative analysis, since it evaluates
whether the conclusions of the DTPP EIR would change if the 2015 data was used for the baseline
assumptions. This approach assumes that the growth in traffic volumes between 2010 and 2015
was not accounted for in the DTPP EIR, even though the DTPP EIR did project for traffic growth in
this five year period and therefore implicitly includes some double-counting of traffic.


DATA COMPARISON

Fehr & Peers compared the adjusted July 2015 AM and PM peak hour intersection turning
movement volumes to 2010 volumes presented in the DTPP EIR. Overall the 2015 intersection
volumes are a little higher than the 2010 volumes, which was expected with the improving
economy in the Bay Area. All of the total intersection volumes from 2015 are below the
cumulative projects, while there are some variations for individual turning movement. This is not
unexpected, since you would expect growth in traffic over the five year period. As discussed in
detail below, these changes in the 2015 volumes do not constitute a substantial change and

would not change the conclusions of the DTPP EIR. Table 2 presents the results for the AM peak
hour and Table 3 the results for the PM peak hour. The volume comparisons for each peak hour
are discussed below.

AM Volume Summary

As shown in Table 2, five of the eight locations are between 40 and 290 vehicles greater than the
2010 data. At the remaining three intersections the 2015 data is actually between 60 and 510
vehicles lower than the 2010 data. However, in all instances, the 2015 total intersection volumes
are lower than the DTPP’s Cumulative Plus Project projections. The five intersections where the
2015 total intersection volumes are higher than the 2010 data include:

       Broadway/Marshall Street (#1): Approximately 140 vehicles higher
       Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue (#2): Approximately 45 vehicles higher
       Marshall Street/Main Street (#3): Approximately 290 vehicles higher
       Broadway/Jefferson (#5): Approximately 90 vehicles higher
       Broadway/Main Street (6): Approximately 100 vehicles higher

As stated above, the DTPP EIR anticipated substantial growth in traffic volumes over time. The
differences outlined above between the 2008-2010 existing conditions in the DTPP EIR and the
2015 traffic counts would not have a substantial effect on the intersection LOS results and impact
conclusions presented in the DTPP EIR. Each of the six intersections is discussed below.

Broadway/Marshall Street (#1)

Overall, the 2015 AM volumes at the Broadway/Marshall Street intersection are about 140
vehicles greater than the 2010 volumes from the DTPP EIR. The increase in volumes is mainly
attributed to increases in the eastbound through movement. Such a variation in projections is not
uncommon, especially in a downtown area with a good grid street network where multiple
equally attractive access paths are available.

Based on the DTPP EIR, the intersection operated at LOS B with 16.9 seconds of delay in 2010
during the AM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0 seconds of
delay. Adding vehicles to the intersection to account for different access patterns could change
operations to LOS C, which is considered an acceptable level of service.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS B under Cumulative Plus Project
Conditions. If the 2015 counts were used as a new baseline data, Cumulative LOS would likely be
LOS C (i.e. not degrade to below acceptable LOS D (>55.0 seconds of delay)) and would not
trigger a significance finding and no new significant impacts would be identified for the
Broadway/Marshall Street intersection. Since the new data does not change the impact discussion
from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance conclusions are still valid for the 601 Marshall
Street project.

Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue (#2)

Overall, the 2015 AM peak hour intersection volume at the Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue
intersection is about 45 vehicles greater than the 2010 AM peak hour intersection volumes from
the DTPP EIR. This represents a nominal change over the 2010 data and is generally distributed
among the different turning movements, with the greatest increase in volumes for the eastbound
through movement.

The DTPP EIR estimated the intersection to operate at LOS B with 19.2 seconds of delay in 2010
during the AM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0 seconds of
delay. Though nominal, adding vehicles to account for the differences in the 2015 volumes could
change operations to LOS C, since the intersection in 2010 operated very close to the 20.0 second
threshold for LOS C. LOS C is considered an acceptable level of service.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS B under Cumulative Plus Project
Conditions. If the 2015 counts were used as a new baseline data, Cumulative LOS is likely to be
LOS C and would not degrade to below acceptable LOS D (> 55.0 seconds of delay) and would
not trigger a significance finding and no new significant impacts would be identified for the
Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue intersection. The new data does not change the impact
discussion from the DTPP EIR and the significance conclusions from the DTPP EIR are still valid for
the 601 Marshall Street project.

Marshall Street/Main Street (#3)

Overall, the 2015 AM peak hour intersection volume at the Marshall Street/Main Street
intersection is about 285 vehicles greater than the 2010 AM peak hour intersection volumes from
the DTPP EIR. The increase in volume is mainly attributed to increases in the westbound through
movement. The 2015 westbound through volumes are likely higher than in 2010 because more
vehicles are accessing the public garage between Main Street and Jefferson Street via Marshall
Street as contemplated in the DTPP. As noted previously, such variation among individual turning

movement and intersection projections is not uncommon, especially in a downtown area with a
good grid street network where multiple equally attractive access paths are available.

The DTPP EIR estimated the intersection to operate at LOS B with 13.3 seconds of delay in 2010
during the AM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0 seconds of
delay. Adding the vehicles to the intersection to account for changes in access patterns would
likely not results in operations exceeding 20.0 seconds of delay. Therefore, the intersection would
continue to operate at LOS B even with the 2015 data.

The DTPP EIR projected the intersection to operate at LOS A under Cumulative Plus Project
Conditions. If the 2015 counts were used as a new baseline data, Cumulative LOS would likely be
LOS B (e.g. would not degrade to below acceptable LOS D (> 55.0 second of delay) would not
trigger a significance finding and no new significant impacts would be identified for the Marshall
Street/Main Street intersection. Since the new data does not change the impact discussion from
the DTPP, the DTPP EIR’s significance conclusions are still valid for the 601 Marshall Street project.

Broadway/Jefferson Avenue (#5)

Overall, the 2015 AM peak hour intersection volume at the Broadway/Jefferson Avenue
intersection is about 90 vehicles greater than the 2010 AM peak hour intersection volumes from
the DTPP EIR. This represents a nominal change over the 2010 data and is generally distributed
among the different turning movements, with the greatest increase in volumes for the eastbound
through and right-turn movements.

The DTPP EIR estimated the intersection to operate at LOS A with 8.0 seconds of delay in 2010
during the AM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS A must have less than 10.0 seconds of
delay. Though nominal, adding vehicles to account for the differences in the 2015 volumes could
change operations to LOS B, since the intersection in 2010 operated very close to the 10.0 second
threshold for LOS B. LOS B is considered an acceptable level of service.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS B with 18.9 seconds of delay under
Cumulative Plus Project Conditions. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0
seconds of delay. Though the addition of 89 trips is not likely to result in LOS C operations, if the
2015 counts were used as a new baseline data, the Cumulative LOS could be LOS C. LOS C is
considered an acceptable service level and would not trigger a finding of significance and no new
significant impacts would be identified for the Broadway/Jefferson Avenue intersection. Since the
new data does not change the impact discussion from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance
conclusions are still valid for the 601 Marshall Street project.

Broadway/Main Street (#6)

Overall, the 2015 AM peak hour intersection volume at the Broadway/Main Street intersection is
about 100 vehicles greater than the 2010 AM peak hour intersection volumes from the DTPP EIR.
This represents a nominal change over the 2010 data and is generally distributed among the
different turning movements, with the greatest increase in volumes for the southbound through
movements.

The DTPP EIR estimated the intersection to operate at LOS A with 9.7 seconds of delay in 2010
during the AM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS A must have less than 10.0 seconds of
delay. Though nominal, adding vehicles to account for the differences in the 2015 volumes could
change operations to LOS B, since the intersection in 2010 operated very close to the 10.0 second
threshold for LOS B. LOS B is considered an acceptable level of service.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS B with 18.9 seconds of delay under
Cumulative Plus Project Conditions. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0
seconds of delay. Though the addition of 102 trips is not likely to result in LOS C operations, if the
2015 counts were used as a new baseline data, the Cumulative LOS could be LOS C. LOS C is
considered an acceptable service level and would not trigger a finding of significance and no new
significant impacts would be identified for the Broadway/Jefferson Avenue intersection. Since the
new data does not change the impact discussion from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance
conclusions are still valid for the 601 Marshall Street project.

PM Volume Summary

As shown in Table 3, the 2015 PM total intersection volumes for six of the eight locations are
between 60 and 430 vehicles greater than the 2010 data. At Middlefield Rd and El Camino Real
intersections on Jefferson Avenue, the 2015 data is actually between 300 and 660 vehicles lower
than the 2010 data. However, in all instances, the 2015 total intersection volumes are lower than
the DTPP’s Cumulative Plus Project projections. The six intersections where the 2015 total
intersection volumes are higher than the 2010 data include:

       Broadway/Marshall Street (#1): Approximately 215 vehicles higher
       Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue (#2): Approximately 175 vehicles higher
       Marshall Street/Main Street (#3): Approximately 430 vehicles higher
       Broadway/ Middlefield Road (#4): Approximately 210 vehicles higher
       Broadway/Jefferson (#5): Approximately 200 vehicles higher

       Broadway/Main Street (6): Approximately 60 vehicles higher

As stated above, the DTPP EIR anticipated substantial growth in traffic volumes over time. As was
found with the AM peak hour analysis, the differences outlined above between the 2008-2010
existing conditions counts in the DTPP EIR and the 2015 traffic counts would not have a
substantial effect on the intersection LOS results and impact conclusions presented in the DTPP
EIR. Each of the six intersections is discussed below.

Broadway/Marshall Street (#1)

Overall, the 2015 PM peak hour intersection volume at the Broadway/Marshall Street intersection
is about 215 vehicles greater than the 2010 PM peak hour intersection volumes from the DTPP
EIR. The increase in volume is mainly attributed to increases in the westbound through
movement. As noted previously, such variation in individual turning movement and intersection
projections is not uncommon, especially in a downtown area with a good grid street network
where multiple equally attractive access paths are available.

The DTPP EIR estimated the intersection to operate at LOS C in 2010 with 26.9 seconds of delay
during the PM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS C must have less than 35.0 seconds of
delay (i.e. LOS D starts at 35.1 seconds of delay). Adding the vehicles to the intersection to
account for changes in access patterns would likely not results in operations exceeding 35.0
seconds of delay. Therefore, the intersection would continue to operate at LOS C with the 2015
data.

The DTPP EIR projected the intersection to operate at LOS C under Cumulative Plus Project
Conditions. If the 2015 counts were used as new baseline data, Cumulative LOS would likely
remain at LOS C (e.g. would not degrade to below acceptable LOS D (>55.0 seconds of delay))
and would not trigger a significance finding and no new significant impacts would be identified
for the Broadway/Marshall Street intersection. Since the new data does not change the impact
discussion from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance conclusions are still valid for the 601
Marshall Street project.

Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue (#2)

Overall, the 2015 PM peak hour intersection volume at the Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue
intersection is about 175 vehicles greater than the 2010 PM peak hour intersection volumes from
the DTPP EIR. The increase in volume is mainly attributed to increases in the eastbound and
westbound through movements. The 2015 eastbound and westbound through volumes are likely
higher than in 2010 because more vehicles are accessing the public garage between Main Street
and Jefferson Street via Marshall Street as contemplated in the DTPP EIR. As noted previously,
such variation in individual turning movement and intersection projections is not uncommon,
especially in a downtown area with a good grid street network where multiple equally attractive
access paths are available.

The DTPP EIR estimated the intersection to operate at LOS C in 2010 with 20.1 seconds of delay
during the PM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS C must have less than 35.0 seconds of
delay. Adding the vehicles to the intersection to account for changes in access patterns would
likely not results in operations exceeding 35.0 seconds of delay. Therefore, the intersection would
continue to operate at LOS C with the 2015 data.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS C under Cumulative Plus Project
Conditions. If the 2015 counts were used as new baseline data, Cumulative LOS would likely
remain at LOS C (e.g. would not degrade to below acceptable LOS D (>55.0 seconds of delay))
and would not trigger a significance finding and no new significant impacts would be identified
for the Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue intersection. Since the new data does not change the
impact discussion from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance conclusions are still valid for the
601 Marshall Street project.

Marshall Street/Main Street (#3)

Overall, the 2015 volumes at the Marshall Street/Main Street intersection are about 430 vehicles
greater than the 2010 volumes from the DTPP. The increase in volumes is attributed to increases
in the eastbound and westbound through movements and eastbound right-turns. Similar to the
discussion on the Marshall Street/Jefferson Avenue volumes, the 2015 eastbound and westbound
through movement and eastbound right-turn volumes are likely higher than the 2010 data
because more vehicles are accessing the public garage between Main Street and Jefferson Street
via Marshall Street as contemplated in the DTPP EIR.

Based on the DTPP EIR, the intersection operated at LOS B with 14.9 seconds of delay in 2010
during the PM peak hour. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0 seconds of

delay. Adding vehicles to the intersection to account for different access patterns would likely
operations to LOS C, which is considered an acceptable level of service.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS B under Cumulative Plus Project
Conditions. If the 2015 counts were used as new baseline data, Cumulative LOS would likely be
LOS C (e.g. not degrade to below acceptable LOS D (> 55.0 seconds of delay) and would not
trigger a significance threshold and no new significant impacts would be identified for the
Marshall Street/Main Street intersection. Since the new data does not change the impact
discussion from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance conclusions are still valid for the 601
Marshall Street project.

Broadway/Middlefield Road (#4)

Overall, the 2015 volumes at the Broadway/Middlefield Road intersection are about 210 vehicles
greater than the 2010 volumes from the DTPP. The increase in volumes is attributed to increases
in the northbound right-turn, southbound left-turn, and eastbound through movements. The
2015 volumes are likely higher than in 2010 at these movements due to construction traffic
diversion.

Based on the DTPP EIR, the intersection operated at LOS A with 8.4 seconds of delay in 2010
during the PM peak hour. Adding vehicles to the intersection to account for different access
patterns would likely change operations to LOS B, which is considered an acceptable level of
service.

The DTPP projected the intersection to operate at LOS B with 10.1 seconds of delay under
Cumulative Plus Project Conditions. Intersections that operate at LOS B must have less than 20.0
seconds of delay. If the 2015 counts were used as new baseline data, Cumulative LOS would likely
remain at LOS B (e.g. would not degrade to below acceptable LOS D) and would not trigger a
significance   finding     and   no   new   significant   impacts   would   be   identified   for   the
Broadway/Middlefield Road intersection. Since the new data does not change the impact
discussion from the DTPP EIR, the DTPP EIR’s significance conclusions are still valid for the 601
Marshall Street project.

Broadway/Jefferson Avenue (#5)

Overall, the 2015 PM peak hour intersection volume at the Broadway/Jefferson Avenue
intersection is about 200 vehicles greater than the 2010 PM peak hour intersection volumes from
the DTPP EIR. The increase in volume is mainly attributed to increases in the eastbound through
and right-turn movements. As noted previously, such variation in individual turning movement
