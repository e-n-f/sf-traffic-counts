SUBJECT:     Ninth & John Residential Tower (MUP 3024760) ă Traffic Impact Analysis
             TENW Project No. 3528
This memorandum summarizes the results of a traffic impact analysis for a proposed redevelopment
known as the Ninth & John Residential Tower, a mixed-use project at the northwest quadrant of the
Ninth Avenue N and John Street intersection in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle,
WA. Upon completion, the proposed project would replace existing low-rise office and
warehouse buildings with surface parking, with a 279 unit apartment complex and 5,000 square-
feet of ground-floor commercial retail (280 feet in height), and approximately 249 on-site parking
stalls.

Project Description
The proposed mixed-use project is located at 820 John Street (MUP 3024760). A project site
vicinity map is provided in Figure 1. The development would remove several existing commercial
buildings totaling approximately 14,200 square-feet of office and 945 square-feet of warehouse
along with associated surface parking on three separate parcels.

The project would include up to 279 apartment units and 5,000 square-feet of ground floor retail
with 249 underground parking stalls in a 280-foot high tower building. A conceptual site plan is
provided as Figure 2. Existing vehicle driveways onto John Street would be removed and all
vehicular site access to a proposed underground parking garage would be via a 16 foot wide
alleyway that runs north-south along the westerly edge of the subject properties. No access is
proposed on any public street frontages, and as such, vehicular/pedestrian conflicts would be kept
to a minimum.

Existing Transportation Conditions
This section includes an inventory of existing roadway conditions, existing peak hour traffic
volumes, intersection levels of service, collision history, public transportation services, nonmotorized
facilities and planned transportation improvements.

Roadway Conditions
The following paragraphs describe existing roadway conditions affecting site access, including
number of lanes, and shoulder types and widths. All arterials within the City of Seattle are posted
at 25 mph.

9th Avenue N is a two-lane principal arterial with bicycle lanes, parking, curbs, gutters and
sidewalks with landscaping on both sides of the street. The curb-to-curb pavement width is
approximately 40 feet north of 9th Avenue N.

Dexter Avenue N is a three-lane minor arterial with two lanes in each direction and a center, two-
way left-turning lane. Bicycle lanes, parking, curbs, gutters and sidewalks are provided on both
sides of the street. The curb-to-curb pavement width is about 67 feet.

Thomas Street is a two-lane access street with parking, curbs, gutters and sidewalks on both sides
of the street. The curb-to-curb pavement width is approximately 39 feet adjacent to the project site.

John Street is a two-lane unchannelized access street with parking, curbs, gutters and sidewalks on
both sides of the street. It should be noted that parallel parking is provided on the north side of the
street and diagonal, back-in parking is provided on the south side of the street. The curb-to-curb
pavement width is about 38 feet.

Denny Way is a four-lane principal arterial with curbs, gutters and sidewalks on both sides of the
street. Travel lanes are 11 to 12 feet.

Existing Peak Hour Traffic Volumes
Peak hour traffic volumes represent the highest hourly volume of vehicles passing through an
intersection during a typical 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM weekday peak period. Peak period turning
movement counts during the PM peak hour at five study intersections was conducted in August
2017 by Idax Data Solutions. Figure 3 summarizes existing PM peak period turning movements at
the study intersections. Traffic counts are provided in Attachment A.

Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service (LOS) analyses were conducted at the study intersections during the
weekday PM peak hour of 2017 existing conditions. LOS refers to the degree of congestion on a
roadway or intersection. It is a measure of vehicle operating speed, travel time, travel delays, and
driving comfort. A letter scale from A to F generally describes LOS. At signalized intersections,
LOS A represents free-flow conditions-motorists experience little or no delays, and LOS F represents
forced-flow conditions-motorists experience an average delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle.

The LOS reported for signalized intersections represents the average control delay per vehicle
entering the intersection. The LOS reported at stop-controlled intersections is also based on the
average control delay (sec/veh) and is reported for each movement. Therefore, the reported LOS
at unsignalized intersections does not represent a measure of the overall operations of the
intersection.

LOS calculations for both signalized and stop-controlled intersections were calculated using the
methodologies and procedures outlined in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Special
Report 209, Transportation Research Board (TRB). Table 1 outlines the LOS criteria for signalized
and unsignalized intersections based on these methodologies.

PM peak hour LOS analyses are summarized in Table 2. As shown, stop-controlled movements at
all unsignalized intersections currently operate at LOS F and reflect the recent reduction in traffic
capacity at the intersection due to installation of protected bike lanes. All signalized intersections
operate at LOS B under existing conditions during the PM peak hour.

Detailed LOS summary worksheets are included in Attachment B.

Collision History

The frequency and severity of collisions are commonly weighted against speed, volume, and
functional classification of a roadway segment or intersection. These variables are considered in
determining if a certain location has an unusually high collision rate. Collision data is assessed to
determine if there are any traffic safety conditions that could impact or be impacted by the
proposed project. Table 3 summarizes historical collision data as provided by the City of Seattle
for the most recent 3.6-year period between January 1, 2014 to July 31, 2017 at all study
intersections.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high collision location status to signalized
intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized intersections with five or
more reported collisions per year. As shown in Table 3, within the analysis period, all
unsignalized locations had less than 5 collisions per year and all signalized locations had less than
10 collisions per year. Therefore, no safety issues at the study intersections are indicated per the
historical collision data.

Traffic Impact Analysis
The following section describes projected future baseline traffic growth, new trips generated by the
proposed development, distribution and assignment of new project trips, intersection level of service
impacts, site access, safety and circulation issues, parking demand analysis, transportation
concurrency, and identification of transportation mitigation to offset impacts.


2020 Baseline Traffic Volumes

For the purpose of the traffic analysis, year 2020 will be selected as the build-out year based upon
anticipated completion and occupancy of the Ninth & John Residential Tower redevelopment. Per
direction from the City of Seattle, 2020 baseline traffic volumes were estimated by applying a 1
percent per year background growth factor and additional project traffic that would be generated
by the following eleven pipeline projects (forecasts are provided in Attachment C):

Project Trip Generation

Published trip rate equations compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation, 9th Edition, 2012, were used to estimate daily, a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic that
would be generated by the proposed development assuming new High-Rise Apartments (ITE Land
Use Code 222) and Specialty Retail (ITE Land Use Code 826) and removal of the existing Office
(ITE Land Use Code 710) and Warehouse (ITE Land Use Code 150) uses. Direct application of
ITE rates is considered a conservative method given likely mode split for this area and vehicle
availability.

As shown in Table 4, an estimated net increase of approximately 69 a.m. peak hour (5 entering
and 64 exiting), and 89 p.m. peak hour vehicular trips (62 entering and 27 exiting) would be
generated with redevelopment of the site when applying standard trip generation rates. However,
given the siteÊs proximity to the Sound Lake Union street car (within 1 block), future LRT station, and
the frequent fixed route transit service on multiple arterials, a mode share adjustment is warranted to
refine standard trip generation rates. Applying Sound Transit access mode shares lower than
recent station area access studies for residential trips, a 20 percent reduction in residential trips
would result in a net increase of approximately 52 a.m. peak hour trips (1 entering and 51
exiting), and 68 p.m. peak hour trips (49 entering and 19 exiting). The Northgate Station Access
Study is provided in Attachment D.

Trip Distribution

To distribute trips onto the vicinity-street and arterial network, trip distribution patterns provided by
the City of Seattle DPD DirectorÊs Rule 5-2009 were used. Based on this methodology, the project
trips were assigned to the street network based on trip distribution tables generated by the CityÊs
traffic forecasting model. The project site is located in Zone 9. Generally, the average distribution

and assignment of project trips for residential and retail trips would be as follows (distribution
illustrated in Figure 4 and PM peak hour trip assignment shown in Figure 5):

            20   percent   North via I-5;
            10   percent   North via SR 99;
            15   percent   West via Local Streets within Zone 8 and 9;
            10   percent   East via Local Streets;
            35   percent   South via Local Streets into the downtown core; and
            10   percent   South via I-5.


Intersection Level of Service Impacts

Estimated project intersection LOS impacts during the PM peak hour in 2020 with and without the
project are summarized in Table 5 with traffic volumes provided in Figure 6. As shown, traffic
control improvements at Intersection #1 Dexter Avenue N at Thomas Street and Intersection #4 9th
Avenue N at John Street would improve operations at these intersections to LOS B with and without
the project in 2020 under PM peak hour conditions. All other intersections operate at LOS B or
better with and without the project during the PM peak hour in 2020.

Intersection #2 Dexter Avenue N at John Street would continue to operate at LOS F in 2020 with
and without the project under PM peak hour conditions. This intersection currently experiences
significant traffic demand bypassing Denny Way to access the SR 99 (Aurora Avenue) corridor.
Mitigation in the form of all-way stop control (LOS D) or signal control (LOS A) would be
recommended at this intersection. Detailed LOS summary worksheets for future 2020 conditions
with and without the project are included in Attachment B.

Site Access and Safety Issues

As part of the redevelopment, existing vehicle driveways onto John Street would be removed and
all vehicular site access to a proposed underground parking garage would be via an existing
alleyway that runs north-south along the westerly edge of the subject properties. No access is
proposed on any public street frontages, and as such, vehicular/pedestrian conflicts would be kept
to a minimum. As shown, delay exiting both alleyway access points would operate at LOS B.

Parking Demand Analysis
A parking impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the supply/demand generated by the
proposed project. The parking impact analysis reviewed:
     City of Seattle parking requirements.
     Parking demand of proposed commercial development using ITE rates.
     City of Seattle bicycle parking requirements.

The project would provide up to 249 on-site parking stalls in an underground garage.


City of Seattle Parking Requirements

Based upon City of Seattle off-street parking standards (Seattle Municipal Code Title 23.54.015 ă
Chart A Parking), Table 6 summarizes minimum off-street parking stalls required. As shown, since
the project is within a designated Urban Center, the City of Seattle would require no off-street
parking for either proposed residential or commercial use. As the project is proposing 249 stalls,
the on-site parking would exceed this minimum requirement.

Project Parking Demand

For the project, the Institute of Transportation Engineers Parking Generation, Fourth Edition, 2010,
transit availability, walkability factors, and the size/location of office use were all considered to
determine parking demand for the proposed mixed use project at Ninth & John Residential Tower.
Based upon Land Use Code 222 for High-Rise Apartments and Shopping Center (LUC 820) for
specialty retail uses, direct application of published rates in Parking Generation, 4th Edition,
estimate the peak development parking demand at a total of 139 parking stalls (see Table 7).

    TENW                                                                                                 August 23, 2017

Applying Sound Transit access mode shares from recent station area access studies for residential
trips, a 20 percent reduction in parking demand for transit availability and 38 percent reduction for
existing vehicle availability and the high walkscore/mixed land use is expected. Given the
location and size of the proposed use, it is very likely that many types of residential-based trips
would walk to available commercial, retail, and service uses in the vicinity. This finding is in line
with the King County Right Size Parking model (see Attachment F), which recommends a „built‰
parking stall ratio of 0.61 stalls per unit. Additionally, during typical weekday days, residential
demand decreases down to 75 percent of peak when retail peak occurs, and evening hours when
residential uses peak and no retail demand is generated. Therefore, a 25 percent reduction in
residential parking demand to account for time of day is estimated in ITE parking generation rates.

As such, on-site parking demand generated by the project is expected to be 61 peak stalls with
transit, walking and time of day adjustments.

 Transportation Concurrency
 Prior to development approval, a transportation concurrency analysis is conducted based on the
 City of SeattleÊs DirectorÊs Rule 5-2009. Transportation concurrency standards are used to
 determine the acceptable balance between the demand for use of the arterial systems and the
 capacity of the transportation system. Total capacity is based not only on the facilities currently in
 existence, but also on known future projects.

 Transportation concurrency review in the City of Seattle is evaluated first by determining applicable
 screenlines. A screenline is an imaginary line drawn across several arterials at a particular location
 where the volume to-capacity ratio (v/c) is calculated. The following screenlines were evaluated:
         2 Magnolia
         5.12 Ship Canal Fremont Bridge
         5.13 Ship Canal Aurora Avenue N
         5.16 Ship Canal University and Montlake Bridges
         8 South of Lake Union
         10.11 South of S Jackson Street ă Alaskan Way S to 4th Avenue S
         12.12 East of CBD

 Baseline traffic volumes for the screenlines were obtained from the DirectorÊs Rule 5-2009. Project-
 generated traffic and pipeline development project trips were then added to baseline traffic
 volumes at the screenline. The total traffic volume, including the proposed developments trips, was
 then divided by the capacity of all roadways crossing the screenline to obtain a volume to capacity
 (v/c) ratio. This ratio was then compared to the LOS standard.

 Table 9 summarizes the transportation concurrency review results for Ninth & John Residential
 project. As shown, the v/c ratios with the development were less than the LOS standard for all
 screenlines. Therefore, no system concurrency mitigation is required.

Mitigation
The proposed Ninth & John Residential Tower, a mixed-use project at the northwest quadrant of the
Ninth Avenue N and John Street and Rainier Avenue S intersection in the South Lake Union
neighborhood of Seattle, WA, would include up to 279 residential apartments and 5,000 square-
feet of commercial retail space. The following mitigation measures may be required as part of the
project development.

The proposed project would construct frontage improvements along 9th Avenue N and John Street.
These frontage improvements would fully integrate with the existing non-motorized facilities along
these street systems, such as new curbs, gutters, sidewalks and sidewalk ramps on all street systems
and striped parking and bicycle lanes on 9th Avenue N. The City may require a proportional
share contribution towards traffic control improvements at the Dexter Avenue and 9th Avenue N
intersection to address existing/future level of service conditions.

Per the CityÊs bicycle parking requirements, the proposed development would be required to
provide 70 off-street bicycle parking stalls.

Transportation Mitigation Payment
To mitigate impacts of the proposal on the surrounding transportation system, the developer would
be required to pay the South Lake Union transportation mitigation payment. The City has
implemented a program in and around the South Lake Union neighborhood that requires new
developments to contribute towards planned improvements identified in the South Lake Union
Transportation Plan. Improvements in this transportation plan include a combination of vehicle,
bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects located in the neighborhood, which would benefit all users.

The development mitigation payment schedule is set forth by DPDÊs Client Assistance Memo 243 ă
Transportation Mitigation Payments (updated October 4, 2012). The proposed development
would be subject to the following mitigation fees:
     $1.95 per square foot of gross floor area of proposed retail space x 5,000 square feet =
      $9,750.00
     $930 per residential dwelling unit x 279 units = $259,470.00
     The total mitigation fee is estimated to be $269,220.00 for the project. This fee is a
      preliminary calculation and would be finalized by the City upon issuance of the decision
      on the proposed project.

The proposed project may have to pay additional proportional share contributions at the following
study intersections where improvements are required under baseline or with project conditions in
2020:

     Intersection #1 Dexter Avenue N at Thomas Street ă Install a traffic signal. Identified in the
      333 8th Avenue N Transportation Impact Analysis. The proportional share contribution is
      estimated at 0.6 percent (8 PM peak project trips and about 1,235 total entering PM
      peak hour trips).
     Intersection #2 Dexter Avenue N at John Street ă Install a traffic signal. Identified as
      mitigation in this traffic study. The proportional share contribution is estimated at 1.2
      percent (15 PM peak project trips and about 1,275 total entering PM peak hour trips).
     Intersection #4 9th Avenue N at John Street ă Modify to an all-way stop controlled
      intersection. Identified in the 300 8th Avenue N Transportation Impact Analysis. The
      proportional share contribution is estimated at 3.5 percent (32 PM peak project trips and
      about 890 total entering PM peak hour trips).
