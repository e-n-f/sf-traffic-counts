Subject:        Traffic Operations Analysis Report for Warm Springs Technology Center


Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc. has completed this traffic operations report for the proposed Warm
Springs Technology Center in Fremont, California. The project, as proposed, would develop approximately
584,205 square feet (SF) of research and development uses and 108,595 SF of industrial uses within a
vacant 22-acre site, in three separate phases. The project site is located within Area 10 of the Warm
Springs Community Plan. The project site is bounded by Warm Springs Boulevard to the west, Reliance Way
to the north, Corporate Way to the south, and industrial uses to the east. Access to the project site would be
via driveways on Warm Springs Boulevard, Reliance Way, and Corporate Way.

Scope	of	Study	
This study includes an analysis of weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions at three unsignalized
intersections. The study intersections are identified below and shown on Figure 1.
    1. Warm Springs Boulevard and Reliance Way
    2. Warm Springs Boulevard and Corporate Way
    3. Warm Springs Boulevard and Warm Springs Court

The FEIR for the Warm Springs Community Plan anticipated new traffic signals would be necessary at the
Warm Springs Boulevard/Reliance Way and Warm Springs Boulevard/Corporate Way intersections, subject
to more detailed analysis based on project-specific detail.
The impacts of the project were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. The AM peak hour of
traffic is typically between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM and the PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 PM and
6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on an average weekday.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing conditions are represented by existing peak hour traffic volumes
               on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from recent traffic
               counts conducted in January 2017 (see Appendix A).

Scenario 2:    Background Conditions. A list of approved and pending developments was obtained from the
               City of Fremont. Approved and pending project-generated traffic volumes were added to
               background plus project traffic volumes. The roadway network was assumed to be
               unchanged from existing conditions for this scenario.

Scenario 3:    Background Plus Project Conditions. Project-generated traffic volumes were added to
               background traffic volumes to estimate background plus project conditions. Background plus
               project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine
               potential project impacts.

Scenario 4:     2035 Cumulative Conditions. Year 2035 base traffic volumes were obtained from the Warm
                Springs Community Plan EIR. The cumulative with project conditions were estimated by
                adding the traffic generated by the project to the cumulative no project traffic volumes.
                Cumulative with project conditions were evaluated relative to cumulative without project
                conditions in order to determine potential long-term project impacts.

This scope of work was developed based on conclusions from a previous letter report prepared by Hexagon
for this project entitled CEQA Transportation Consistency Analysis for the Warm Springs Technology Center.
The subject letter report found that the project was consistent with the Warm Springs Community Plan EIR.
Based on the above finding, a CMA analysis would not be required, and therefore, was not included in this
study. This report also includes the following analyses:

       Vehicle queuing analysis at high demand turn movements
       Project site access and circulation evaluation

Existing	Transportation	Setting	
Regional access to the project site is provided via Interstates 880 (I-880) and 680 (I-680). Local access to
the site is provided via Warm Springs Boulevard, Reliance Way, and Corporate Way. These roadways are
described below.
        Warm Springs Boulevard is a four lane, north-south, arterial street that extends from South
        Grimmer Boulevard in the north to Dixon Landing Road in the south. Warm Springs Boulevard
        becomes Osgood Road north of South Grimmer Boulevard and continues north to intersect with
        Auto Mall Parkway. Entering Santa Clara County just north of Dixon Landing Road, Warm Springs
        Boulevard becomes North Milpitas Boulevard and continues south to Milpitas. It has a landscaped
        median with left turn lanes in the project vicinity. It provides direct access to the project site.
        Reliance Way is a two-lane, east-west, local street with a two-way-left turn lane and parking on both
        sides in its entirety. It provides direct access to the project site as well as to nearby office/industrial
        uses.
        Corporate Way is a two-lane, east-west, local street with a two-way-left-turn lane and parking on
        both sides in its entirety. It provides direct access to the project site as well as to nearby
        office/industrial uses.
        Warm Springs Court is a two-lane, north-south, local street with parking on one side of the street.
        It provides access to the future Warm Springs BART station as well as to nearby office/industrial
        uses.
Sidewalks are generally found along all previously-described roadways in the study area and in the
immediate vicinity of the site. Existing bicycle access to the project vicinity is provided primarily via a network
of nearby Class II bike lanes and Class III bike routes which are shared with vehicular traffic. There are
existing Class II bike lanes on Warm Springs Court and most of Warm Springs Boulevard (including directly
adjacent to the project site).

In the future, the City of Fremont Bicycle Master Plan shows future upgraded Class II bike lanes closing
existing bike lane gaps on Warm Springs Boulevard. According to the Warm Springs Community Plan, Class
II bike lanes are planned on Reliance Way and Corporate Way between Warms Springs Boulevard and
Research Avenue. A Class I bike path is also planned running alongside the Union Pacific Railroad
(UPRR)/future South Fremont BART extension line from Union City in the north to Milpitas in the south.
Existing transit service in the project vicinity is provided primarily by the Alameda Contra Costa Transit
District (AC Transit). The nearest bus routes are Lines 215, 217, and 239. They are described in detail
below.
        Line 215 connects the Fremont BART station with office parks in the Warm Springs area via Warren
        Avenue, Fremont Boulevard, Grimmer Boulevard, Osgood Road, Washington Boulevard, and Paseo
        Padre Parkway. The bus operates between 6:15 AM and 9:30 PM on weekdays, with 60-minute
        headways throughout the day. The closest bus stop is located on Warm Springs Boulevard at Prune
        Avenue approximately 3,000 feet north of the project site.
        Line 217 connects the Fremont BART station with the Milpitas Great Mall transit station via Mission
        Boulevard, Warm Springs Boulevard and North Milpitas Boulevard. The bus operates between 5:14
        AM and 9:44 PM on weekdays with 30-minute headways. The closest bus stop is located on Warm
        Springs Boulevard just south of Mission Boulevard approximately 3,600 feet south of the project site.
        Line 239 connects the Fremont BART station with office parks at Kato Road and Milmont Drive via
        Grimmer Boulevard, Mission Boulevard, and Warm Springs Boulevard. The bus operates between
        5:18 AM and 10:48 PM on weekdays with 30-minute headways during peak periods. The closest
        bus stop is located on Warm Springs Boulevard just south of Mission Boulevard approximately 3,600
        feet south of the project site.
Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) also provides commuter bus services in the project area through
Routes 120 and 140. Route 120 connects Fremont BART to Lockheed Martin Transit Center/Moffett Park in
Sunnyvale whereas Route 140 connects Fremont BART to Mission College and Montague Expressway in
Santa Clara. Both bus routes operate only during morning and afternoon peak hours on weekdays with 30
to 45-minute headways. The closest bus stops are located on Mission Boulevard just east of Warm Springs
Boulevard approximately 3,600 feet south of the project site.
An extension of BART from Fremont to San Jose is under construction along the existing Union Pacific rail
line. A new Warm Springs/South Fremont station, scheduled to open in 2017, will be located approximately
1,000 feet north of the project site. Based on information provided by AC Transit staff, Lines 215 and 239
would also serve the future Warm Springs BART station along their routes. With the future build-out of the
Warm Springs Community Plan around the new BART station, at least one of the two routes would likely be
modified to travel along Warm Springs Boulevard between South Grimmer Boulevard and Mission Boulevard
to better serve the new developments in Plan Areas 9 and 10 in the project vicinity.
According to the Warm Springs Community Plan EIR, planned transit improvements include a circular shuttle
route connecting the Warm Springs BART station to the Tesla Motors plant and other employment centers in
the planning area. The EIR also mentioned a potential street car or bus transit system on Warm Springs
Boulevard to provide improved transit service to and from other areas in Fremont, pending further feasibility
studies.

Existing	Traffic	Observations	
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to
confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing
traffic problems that may not be directly related to intersection level of service, and (2) to identify any
locations where the level of service calculation does not accurately reflect level of service in the field. The
field observations revealed that the level of service analysis generally reflects actual existing traffic
conditions.

Project	Traffic	Estimates                                	


The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would appear
were estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In
determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site was estimated for
the weekday AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution step, an estimate was made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment step, the project
trips were assigned to specific streets and intersections in the study area. These procedures are described
further in the following sections.
In order to be consistent with the Warm Springs Community Plan EIR, trip generation for the project was
calculated in accordance with the same methodology used by the Community Plan EIR. Project trip
generation was estimated by applying to the size and uses of the development the appropriate trip
generation rates published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation, 9th Edition.
Based on ITE’s trip generation rates for general light industrial (ITE code 110) and R&D center (ITE code
760), the project would generate 5,104 gross daily vehicle trips, with 703 trips occurring during the AM peak
hour and 676 trips occurring during the PM peak hour. As indicated in the Warm Springs Community Plan
EIR1, trip reductions were applied to the project trip generation estimates to account for
bus/bicycle/pedestrian trips, and BART ridership. When these reductions are considered, it is estimated that
the project would generate net 4,185 daily vehicle trips, with 569 vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and
555 vehicle trips during the PM peak hour. Table 1 below shows the project trip estimates.
As the land use assumptions for the project are consistent with the Community Plan’s vision for Area 10, the
trip distribution pattern for the proposed uses was estimated based the trip distribution used in the Warm
Springs Community Plan EIR. Trips were assigned to the roadway network in accordance with the trip
distribution. The trip distribution and project trip assignment are shown on Figure 2.

Intersection	(Unsignalized)	Level	of	Service	Analysis	
Traffic volumes for existing conditions were determined from existing traffic counts conducted in January of
2017. Traffic volumes for background conditions were estimated by adding to the existing traffic volumes the
trips generated by approved and pending developments. The City of Fremont has identified the following
approved and pending developments in the project vicinity to be included in the background scenario:

       Osgood Retail Center – 27,226-square foot commercial development located at the southwest
        corner of the intersection at Auto Mall Parkway and Osgood Road/Warm Springs Boulevard.
       Parc 55 Senior Village – a senior housing development with 435 multi-family units and 62 single-
        family units on Warm Springs Boulevard just south of Warren Avenue.
       Old Warm Springs Boulevard South Master Plan – 785 multi-family units and 325,100-square foot
        commercial development located at the northeast corner of the intersection at Grimmer Boulevard
        and Fremont Boulevard.
       Warm Springs Transit Oriented Development (TOD) – 1,000 multi-family units and 5,000-square foot
        commercial development located at the southeast corner of the intersection at South Grimmer
        Boulevard and Warm Springs Boulevard.

       Lennar Master Plan Site – 2,214 multi-family units, 5,488-employee R&D and office development,
        28,000-square foot retail development, and a 1,100-student elementary school located at the
        southeast corner of the intersection at South Grimmer Boulevard and Fremont Boulevard.
The traffic volumes for the study scenarios are shown in Figures 3 through 7. The roadway geometries and
traffic control at the study intersections were assumed to remain unchanged under all study scenarios. Under
cumulative conditions, there are several proposed large scale transportation improvements in the study area
that will alter travel patterns, including but not limited to, a northbound high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane on
I-680 and the BART extension to San Jose. These improvements are described in detail in the Warm
Springs Community Plan EIR.
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no
delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The City of Fremont utilizes TRAFFIX software
and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology to evaluate intersection operations. The HCM
methodology evaluates intersection operations on the basis of average delay time for all vehicles at the
intersection. This average delay can then be correlated to a level of service.
All of the study intersections are currently unsignalized. Unlike the signalized level of service impact
methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this section are based on professional
judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by the traffic engineering community.
The City of Fremont does not have formal impact criteria to apply to unsignalized intersections. This is
common for many jurisdictions because it is generally not the unsignalized intersections that limit the overall
capacity of a roadway. The analysis of unsignalized intersections is typically evaluated by considering
overall level of service, movement delay, availability of alternative routes, intersection spacing, and an
analysis of traffic signal warrants. The results of the unsignalized intersection levels of service analysis
under all study scenarios are summarized in Table 2 and described below. The level of service calculation
sheets are included in Appendix B. The traffic signal warrant sheets are included in Appendix C.

Warm	Springs	Boulevard	and	Reliance	Way	
The results show that the side-street-stop-controlled intersection at Warm Springs Boulevard and Reliance
Way currently operates at LOS F for the worst approach (westbound) in the PM peak hour (the intersection
operates at LOS A based on the overall average delay for the entire intersection). Existing traffic conditions
at this intersection during the AM peak hour are a satisfactory LOS D for the worst approach and LOS A for
the entire intersection. Under background and cumulative conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS
F for the worst approach (westbound) in both the AM and PM peak hours.
The results show that traffic conditions at the side-street-stop-controlled intersection of Warm Springs
Boulevard and Reliance Way will worsen with the addition of project traffic. The results show that, with the
addition of project traffic, the intersection would operate at LOS F overall and for the worst approach during
the PM peak hour under background plus project and cumulative plus project conditions. During the AM
peak hour, the intersection would operate at LOS A overall and LOS F for the worst approach under all
project conditions.
A peak-hour volume traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted for the intersection of Warm Springs
Boulevard and Reliance Way for the AM and PM peak-hour periods under background and cumulative
conditions with and without the proposed project. The traffic signal warrant was met under background plus
project and cumulative plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The traffic signal warrant was not
satisfied under background and cumulative conditions without the proposed project. The traffic signal warrant
sheets are included in Appendix B.
        Recommendation #1: Because (1) the traffic signal warrant was met under background plus
        project and cumulative plus project conditions and (2) due to the substantial increase in vehicular
        delays at the intersection, installation of a traffic signal is recommended to improve traffic operations
        and safety. Because the traffic signal warrant was met under background plus project conditions,
        and was not met without the proposed project, the project sponsor would be responsible for the
        installation of the traffic signal and its interconnect with nearby traffic signals.
With signalization, the intersection would operate at LOS C or better under background plus project and
cumulative plus project conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. Although satisfaction of a traffic signal
warrant does not, in itself, require the installation of a traffic signal as stated in the CA MUTCD, signalization
of this intersection would improve level of service and reduce delays for the inbound and outbound vehicular
movements. It would also provide a controlled pedestrian crossing on Warm Springs Boulevard. The closest
existing crosswalk is at Warm Springs Court, approximately 1,100 feet south of the Reliance Way
intersection. The spacing between the subject intersection and its adjacent signalized intersections to the
north and south are 800 feet and 2,800 feet, respectively, which would be adequate.

Warm	Springs	Boulevard	and	Corporate	Way	
The results show that the side-street-stop-controlled intersection at Warm Springs Boulevard and Corporate
Way currently operates at LOS F for the worst approach (westbound) in the PM peak hour (the intersection
operates at LOS A based on the overall average delay for the entire intersection). Existing traffic conditions
at this intersection during the AM peak hour are a satisfactory LOS B for the worst approach and LOS A for
the entire intersection. Under background conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS D and LOS F
for the worst approach (westbound) during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. Under cumulative
conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS F for the worst approach (westbound) in both the AM and
PM peak hours.
The results show that traffic conditions at the side-street-stop-controlled intersection of Warm Springs
Boulevard and Corporate Way will worsen with the addition of project traffic. The results show that, with the
addition of project traffic, the intersection would operate at LOS F overall during the PM peak hour and LOS
F for the worst approach during the AM and PM peak hours under background plus project conditions.
Under cumulative plus project conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS F overall during the PM
peak hour and LOS F for the worst approach during both the AM and PM peak hours.
A peak-hour volume traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted for the intersection of Warm Springs
Boulevard and Corporate Way for the AM and PM peak-hour periods under background and cumulative
conditions with and without the proposed project. The traffic signal warrant was met under background plus
project and cumulative plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The traffic signal warrant was not
satisfied under no project background and cumulative conditions. The traffic signal warrant sheets are
included in Appendix B.
As mentioned previously, satisfying one or more traffic signal warrants does not automatically require the
installation of a traffic signal. Other factors such as intersection spacing, availability of alternate routes,
pedestrian volumes, and delays for other peak hour periods must be considered. Because the project site
would provide connectivity to, and between, Corporate Way and Reliance Way, signalization of this
intersection is unnecessary if a traffic signal were installed at the intersection of Warm Springs Boulevard
and Reliance Way. Motorists will naturally find the shortest route with the least delays to reach their intended
destinations. When traffic from Corporate Way experiences long delays waiting at the stop sign for gaps on
Warm Springs Boulevard, traffic will gravitate toward the traffic signal at Reliance Way where the delays
would be much shorter and predictable. This would cause the vehicular delays at the Corporate Way
approach to decrease during the peak hours until a reasonable balance is achieved between the two
locations. During off peak periods with less traffic on Warm Springs Boulevard, the Corporate Way approach
would operate with much lower vehicular delays.

Warm	Springs	Boulevard	and	Warm	Springs	Court	
The results show that the side-street-stop-controlled intersection at Warm Springs Boulevard and Warm
Springs Court currently operates at LOS D for the worst approach in the PM peak hour (the intersection
operates at LOS A based on the overall average delay for the entire intersection). Existing traffic conditions
at this intersection during the AM peak hour are a satisfactory LOS C for the worst approach and LOS A for
the entire intersection. Under background conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS E and LOS F
for the worst approach during the AM and PM peak hours. Under cumulative conditions, the intersection
would operate at LOS F for the worst approach during both the AM and PM peak hours.
The results show that PM peak-hour traffic conditions at the side-street-stop-controlled intersection of Warm
Springs Boulevard and Warm Springs Court will worsen with the addition of project traffic. The results show
that the intersection would operate at LOS F for the worst approach during the PM peak hour under
background plus project conditions. Under cumulative plus project conditions, the intersection would
operate at LOS F for the worst approach during both the AM and PM peak hours.
A peak-hour volume traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted for the intersection of Warm Springs
Boulevard and Warm Springs Court for the AM and PM peak-hour periods under background and cumulative

conditions with and without the proposed project. The traffic signal warrant was met under cumulative no
project and cumulative plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The traffic signal warrant sheets are
included in Appendix B. Because (1) the traffic signal warrant is met with or without the addition of project
trips under cumulative conditions and (2) the project would not add trips to the Warm Springs Court
approach, the project’s traffic contribution to this intersection is considered less than significant under
cumulative conditions. It is recommended that the City of Fremont continue to monitor this intersection for
signalization in future traffic studies as the Warm Springs Community Plan is built-out.

Vehicle	Queuing	Analysis	
A vehicle queuing analysis was conducted for high demand turn movements at the intersections of Warm
Springs Boulevard/Reliance Way and Warm Springs Boulevard/Corporate Way. Vehicle queues were
estimated using a Poisson probability distribution. The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson
probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal
cycle for a particular movement; (2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated
into a queue length, assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is
compared to the existing or planned available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus
provides a basis for estimating future storage requirements at intersections. The results of this analysis are
summarized below and in Table 3 for the AM and PM peak hours. These results assume that the intersection
of Reliance Way/Warm Springs Boulevard would be signalized (as previously recommended) and that
project traffic would rebalance itself between Reliance Way and Corporate Way accordingly.
The analysis indicates that, with the addition of project traffic, the 95th percentile vehicle queues could be
accommodated by the storage spaces provided at the intersections of Warm Springs Boulevard/Reliance
Way and Warm Springs Boulevard/Corporate Way during the AM and PM peak hours.

Impacts	to	Pedestrians,	Bicycles,	and	Transit	
Most of the streets in the project vicinity have sidewalks and crosswalks at intersections. Existing
observations on Warm Springs Boulevard, Reliance Way, and Corporate Way showed very minimal
pedestrian and bicycle activity in the area.
Due to the close proximity to the future Warm Springs BART station, a sizeable portion of the proposed
project’s employees could be expected to commute via BART and/or other transit systems in the project
area. According to the Warm Springs Community Plan EIR, 18 percent of project trips would occur by way
of walking or biking. (including trips to/from transit stops). For the proposed project, this would equate to
approximately 130 new bike and pedestrian trips during the AM and PM peak hours. Installing a traffic signal
as previously recommended at Reliance Way/Warm Springs Boulevard would improve overall pedestrian
safety and mobility in the project area. Overall, the volume of pedestrian trips generated by the project is not
expected to exceed the carrying capacity of the sidewalks and crosswalks nearby.
Bike lanes are provided on Warm Springs Boulevard directly adjacent to the project frontage. In the future,
Bike lanes are planned for Corporate Way and Reliance Way. These can be accommodated within the
existing right of way, which is approximately 52 feet wide for each street, without a dedication from the
proposed project. Generally, the volume of bicycle trips generated by the project would not exceed the
bicycle-carrying capacity of the streets surrounding the site, and the increase in bicycle trips would not, by
itself, require new off-site bicycle facilities.
        Recommendation #2: Bike parking is not shown on the current site plan. Increasing the quality and
        quantity of bicycle trip end facilities is recommended in the City of Fremont Bicycle Master Plan. It is
        recommended that the project provides convenient short term and long term bicycle parking facilities
        onsite consistent with City requirements. 
According to the Alameda County Congestion Management Program (CMP) Transportation Impact Analysis
Technical Guidelines, a project would create an impact on pedestrian and bike circulation if: (1) its vehicle
trips would present a barrier to bikes/pedestrians safely crossing roadways, or (2) it would reduce or sever
existing or planned bike/pedestrian circulation in the area. Based on these criteria, the proposed project
would not create an adverse impact to bike/pedestrian circulation in the area.
Currently, bus transit service to the project vicinity is provided by the Alameda Contra Costa Transit District
(AC Transit). The nearest bus routes are Lines 215, 217, and 239. The closest bus stop for Line 215 is
located on Warm Springs Boulevard at Prune Avenue approximately 3,000 feet north of the project site.
The closest bus stops for Line 217 and 239 are located on Warm Springs Boulevard just south of Mission
Boulevard approximately 3,600 feet south of the project site. According to Warm Springs Community Plan
EIR, bus trips would comprise approximately 3 percent of the total commute mode share from the project
site. For the proposed project, this would equate to approximately 21 new bus trips during the peak commute
hours. Based on field observations, ridership on the bus routes are relatively low. The volume of riders
generated by the project would not exceed the carrying capacity of the existing bus service near the project
site. Except the following recommendation, no improvements to the existing transit facilities would be
necessary in conjunction with the proposed project.
        Recommendation #3: According to AC Transit staff, with the future build-out of the Warm Springs
        Community Plan around the new BART station, at least one of the AC Transit bus routes would likely
        be modified to travel along Warm Springs Boulevard between South Grimmer Boulevard and
        Mission Boulevard station. It is recommended that the project applicant and City staff consult with
        AC Transit to determine if a bus stop, bench, and/or shelter would be appropriate along the project
        frontage.  
An extension of BART from Fremont to San Jose is under construction along the existing Union Pacific rail
line. A new Warm Springs/South Fremont station, scheduled to open in 2017, would be located
approximately 1,000 feet north of the project site. According to the Warm Springs Community Plan EIR,
BART transit trips would comprise approximately 12 percent of the total commute mode share in the City.
City of Fremont

For the proposed project, this would equate to approximately 84 new transit trips during the peak commute
hours. This volume of potential BART riders would not exceed the capacity of future BART service.
According to the Alameda County Congestion Management Program (CMP) Transportation Impact Analysis
Technical Guidelines, a project would create an impact on transit service if it: (1) causes vehicular
congestion that would significantly degrade transit operations, (2) cause a ridership increase that would
exceed existing transit capacity, or (3) conflict with existing transit service plans or preclude future transit
service to the project area. Based on these criteria, the proposed project would not cause a significant
impact to transit operations in the study area.

Site	Access	&	Circulation	and	Parking	
This site access and circulation review is based on the site plan (dated March 25, 2016) provided to
Hexagon (see Figure 8). The proposed project would have a total of five site driveways: one main site
driveway on Warm Springs Boulevard, two driveways on Reliance Way, and two driveways on Corporate
Way. The main site driveway on Warm Springs Boulevard, which does not currently exist at its proposed
location, would be stop-controlled with right-in/right-out access due to the existing median on Warm Springs
Boulevard. With the abundance of driveways located around the different buildings of the project site,
project users would have multiple routes to access the site. It is anticipated that under project conditions,
vehicles entering and existing the site driveways would experience minimal delays and vehicle queues would
rarely exceed one or two vehicles. The main access driveway on Warm Springs Boulevard between
Reliance Way and Corporate Way has a throat depth of approximately 250 feet (or 10 vehicles), beyond
which vehicle queues exiting the driveway would block the internal access road. The vehicle queues at this
location could easily be accommodated in the storage space provided, and the onsite queues would
generally not interfere with traffic operations on Warm Springs Boulevard.
There are multiple existing driveways on Reliance Way and Corporate Way on the opposite side of the
project frontage. An existing two-way left-turn lane provides left turn access for the driveways on Reliance
Way and Corporate Way. On the north side of Reliance Way, the nearest driveways do not align with the
existing driveways on the opposite side of the street, but are offset at least 120 feet. On the south side of
Corporate Way, the nearest driveways on the opposite side of the street also do not align, but are offset at
least 80 feet. The spacing of the project driveways, and their locations relative to existing driveways, are
acceptable given the relatively low traffic volumes at the nearby driveways, Reliance Way, and Corporate
Way. It is anticipated that left turn queues in the two-way left-turn lanes would rarely exceed one or two
vehicles and delays would be brief.
On Warm Springs Boulevard, there are existing median openings approximately 400 feet north and south of
the proposed Warm Springs driveway at Reliance Way and Corporate Way, respectively. These locations
would provide opportunities for legal U-turn movements. At the north median opening (Reliance Way), the
distance between the outside left turn stripe and the west (southbound) face of curb is approximately 57 feet.
At the south median opening (Corporate Way), the distance between the outside left turn stripe and the east
(northbound) face of curb is approximately 57 feet. According to the standard AASHTO passenger car
design vehicle, a turning diameter of 48 feet is required to accommodate U-turns. Thus, there is sufficient
roadway width at these intersections to accommodate U-turns.
The project site plan includes a centrally located multi-level parking garage, which is surrounded by several
smaller surface parking lots. The proposed office and industrial buildings are located near the periphery of
the site along Reliance Way, Warm Springs Boulevard, and Corporate Way. Both the parking garage and the
surface lots would follow a standard 90-degree parking layout. The garage would be accessed by two main
drive aisles, which align with the main north-south drive aisle in the middle of the project site, and a
secondary drive aisle at the northeast corner of the garage. The main north-south drive aisle is directly
connected with driveways on Reliance Way and Corporate Way.

Upon entering from the main driveway on Warm Springs Boulevard, vehicles would travel on an east-west
drive aisle that separates Office Buildings 1 and 2. This drive aisle would connect with a U-shaped ring road
which then feeds into the surface lots and the parking garage. Overall, the proposed system of a ring road
and feeder drive aisles would provide for reasonably efficient vehicular circulation.
The site plan shows four trash enclosure areas: two are located inside the parking garage, but accessed
from the drive aisles outside the garage, and the rest are located at the back of the industrial building. There
are also two truck loading areas: one accessed from Reliance Way adjacent to Office Building 4 and another
one accessed from Corporate Way adjacent to Office Building 5.
The corner sight distance at the project driveways and the study intersections was checked in the field and
determined to be adequate.
        Recommendation #4: Because the proposed site plan is conceptual, prior to final design, the
        design and layout of the parking garage, drive aisles and driveways, which includes the
        parking/loading area, should be reviewed by Public Works staff. The drive aisles and loading docks
        should be checked to ensure that they can accommodate delivery trucks, garbage trucks, and
        emergency vehicles. The project applicant should provide an exhibit showing truck turn templates
        overlaid onto the site plan. Also, prior to final design, the placement of any landscaping,
        monuments, and signs within the sight triangles of the driveways should be reviewed by Public
        Works staff to ensure adequate corner sight distance.

Onsite, the volume and speed of vehicular traffic would be low enough such that shared use of the entry
driveways and onsite aisles between bikes and motor vehicles would be feasible. Pedestrian access to the
proposed buildings would be provided via a series of onsite pedestrian pathways and crosswalks that link to
the onsite parking areas and sidewalks on Warm Springs Boulevard, Reliance Way, and Corporate Way.
        Recommendation #5: Because of the project’s proximity to the future Warm Springs BART station,
        pedestrian connectivity between the building entrances and the public street network should be
        considered a high priority design element. Prior to final design, the project shall provide a pedestrian
        circulation exhibit detailing the anticipated routes through the project site. The identified routes
        should be both convenient and prominent to encourage transit ridership.

Conclusions	
The impacts of the proposed project were evaluated in accordance with the procedures and guidelines
specified by the City of Fremont. The analysis resulted in the following key findings:

       Based on results of the level of service and traffic signal warrant analyses, it is recommended that a
        new traffic signal to be installed at the intersection of Warm Springs Boulevard and Reliance Way.
        Signalization of this intersection would improve level of service and reduce delays for the inbound
        and outbound vehicular movements. It would also provide a controlled pedestrian crossing on Warm
        Springs Boulevard. Because the traffic signal warrant was met under background plus project
        conditions, and was not met without traffic from the proposed project, the project sponsor would be
        responsible for the installation of the traffic signal.
       The proposed project would not result in any queuing storage deficiencies at the study intersections.
       The project would not create any impacts on pedestrian, bike, or transit facilities.

The analysis also produced the following recommendations:
    1. As stated above, the project sponsor would be responsible for the installation of the traffic signal at
       the intersection of Reliance Way and Warm Springs Boulevard. Signalization would be required prior
       to Phase 1 occupancy of the proposed Master Plan.

    2. Bike parking is not shown on the current site plan. Increasing the quality and quantity of bicycle trip
       end facilities is recommended in the City of Fremont Bicycle Master Plan. It is recommended that
       the project provide convenient short term and long term bicycle parking facilities onsite consistent
       with City requirements.
    3. According to AC Transit staff, with the future build-out of the Warm Springs Community Plan around
       the new BART station, at least one of the AC Transit bus routes would likely be modified to travel
       along Warm Springs Boulevard between South Grimmer Boulevard and Mission Boulevard station.
       It is recommended that the project applicant and City staff consult with AC Transit to determine if a
       bus stop, bench, and/or shelter would be appropriate along the project frontage.
    4. Because the proposed site plan is conceptual, prior to final design, the design and layout of the
       parking garage, drive aisles and driveways, which includes the parking/loading area, should be
       reviewed by Public Works staff. The drive aisles and loading docks should be checked to ensure that
       they can accommodate delivery trucks, garbage trucks, and emergency vehicles. The project
       applicant should provide an exhibit showing truck turn templates overlaid onto the site plan. Also,
       prior to final design, the placement of any landscaping, monuments, and signs within the sight
       triangles of the driveways should be reviewed by Public Works staff to ensure adequate corner sight
       distance.

    5. Because of the project’s proximity to the future Warm Springs BART station, pedestrian connectivity
       between the building entrances and the public street network should be considered a high priority
       design element. Prior to final design, the project shall provide a pedestrian circulation exhibit
       detailing the anticipated routes through the project site. The identified routes should be both
       convenient and prominent to encourage transit ridership.

SIGNAL WARRANT DISCLAIMER
This peak hour signal warrant analysis should be considered solely as an
"indicator" of the likelihood of an unsignalized intersection warranting
a traffic signal in the future. Intersections that exceed this warrant
are probably more likely to meet one or more of the other volume based
signal warrant (such as the 4-hour or 8-hour warrants).

The peak hour warrant analysis in this report is not intended to replace
a rigorous and complete traffic signal warrant analysis by the responsible
jurisdiction. Consideration of the other signal warrants, which is beyond
the scope of this software, may yield different results.

SIGNAL WARRANT DISCLAIMER
This peak hour signal warrant analysis should be considered solely as an
"indicator" of the likelihood of an unsignalized intersection warranting
a traffic signal in the future. Intersections that exceed this warrant
are probably more likely to meet one or more of the other volume based
signal warrant (such as the 4-hour or 8-hour warrants).

The peak hour warrant analysis in this report is not intended to replace
a rigorous and complete traffic signal warrant analysis by the responsible
jurisdiction. Consideration of the other signal warrants, which is beyond
the scope of this software, may yield different results.

SIGNAL WARRANT DISCLAIMER
This peak hour signal warrant analysis should be considered solely as an
"indicator" of the likelihood of an unsignalized intersection warranting
a traffic signal in the future. Intersections that exceed this warrant
are probably more likely to meet one or more of the other volume based
signal warrant (such as the 4-hour or 8-hour warrants).

The peak hour warrant analysis in this report is not intended to replace
a rigorous and complete traffic signal warrant analysis by the responsible
jurisdiction. Consideration of the other signal warrants, which is beyond
the scope of this software, may yield different results.

SIGNAL WARRANT DISCLAIMER
This peak hour signal warrant analysis should be considered solely as an
"indicator" of the likelihood of an unsignalized intersection warranting
a traffic signal in the future. Intersections that exceed this warrant
are probably more likely to meet one or more of the other volume based
signal warrant (such as the 4-hour or 8-hour warrants).

The peak hour warrant analysis in this report is not intended to replace

the scope of this software, may yield different results.

SIGNAL WARRANT DISCLAIMER
This peak hour signal warrant analysis should be considered solely as an
"indicator" of the likelihood of an unsignalized intersection warranting
a traffic signal in the future. Intersections that exceed this warrant
are probably more likely to meet one or more of the other volume based
signal warrant (such as the 4-hour or 8-hour warrants).

The peak hour warrant analysis in this report is not intended to replace
a rigorous and complete traffic signal warrant analysis by the responsible
jurisdiction. Consideration of the other signal warrants, which is beyond
the scope of this software, may yield different results.

SIGNAL WARRANT DISCLAIMER
This peak hour signal warrant analysis should be considered solely as an
"indicator" of the likelihood of an unsignalized intersection warranting
a traffic signal in the future. Intersections that exceed this warrant
are probably more likely to meet one or more of the other volume based
signal warrant (such as the 4-hour or 8-hour warrants).

The peak hour warrant analysis in this report is not intended to replace
a rigorous and complete traffic signal warrant analysis by the responsible
jurisdiction. Consideration of the other signal warrants, which is beyond
the scope of this software, may yield different results.
