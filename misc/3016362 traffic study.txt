FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS
This traffic impact analysis has been prepared for the proposed 400 Dexter Office development.

        Project Proposal. The project proposal includes up to 252,010 square feet (sf) of office space,
        up to 7,500 sf restaurant, and up to 10,000 sf of retail area (7,400 + 2,600 sf mezzanine) on a
        site located at 400 Dexter Avenue in the South Lake Union (SLU) neighborhood of Seattle. The
        existing site contains a variety of existing commercial uses totaling approximately 35,200 sf, all of
        which will be demolished. The anticipated year of project occupancy for the project is 2016.

        Trip Generation. The proposed office development is anticipated to generate a net total of 1,325
        daily vehicle trips, with 196 net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour, and 175
        net new trips during the weekday PM peak hour.

        Access. Vehicle access to/from the site would be provided on the alley located along the east side
        of the project site, which intersects with both Republican Street and Harrison Street. Turn movements
        at both alley intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better in 2016 with the project
        during the PM peak hour.

        Intersection Level of Service (LOS). 11 study intersections were evaluated for PM hour LOS in the
        future with or without the proposed project.

                Turn movements at the four unsignalized study intersections adjacent to the site alley on
                Republican and Harrison and on 8th Avenue are anticipated to operate at LOS D or better.
                Three of the signalized study intersections on Fairview Avenue are expected to operate at
                LOS F in the future with or without the proposed project in the PM peak hour.

                The Dexter/Denny, Fairview/Mercer, and Fairview/Denny intersections are anticipated to
                continue to operate a LOS F and as they serve as gateway access points to/from the SLU
                area. The added traffic from the 400 Dexter office project is not anticipated to be significant.

                The Fairview/Republican intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS F in the future without
                the proposed 400 Dexter office project based using existing signal timing provided by the
                City. Based on projected traffic growth, split-phasing the intersection in the east-west direction
                and maintaining the 160-second cycle would improve the intersection to LOS D operation
                in the PM peak hour with an average delay of about 55 seconds. As a result, it is
                recommended that the City give consideration to east-west split phasing at this intersection
                in the future to accommodate the anticipated pipeline development.

                The Fairview/Harrison intersection is anticipated to operate in the LOS E during the PM peak
                hour with the proposed 400 Dexter office and other pipeline projects. Re-optimizing green
                splits would improve the LOS at this intersection during the PM peak hour in the future.

                                                                                           400 Dexter Office



 Transit & Non-Motorized Impacts. Existing transit service in the vicinity area is anticipated to
 accommodate the anticipated increase in ridership demand from the project. The project location is
 well served with adequate bicycle and pedestrian facilities to accommodate the increased demand
 generated by the project. Secure bicycle storage will be provided for on-site office employees.

 Transportation Concurrency. Transportation concurrency was evaluated for the proposed 400 Dexter
 Office project based on City guidelines outlined in the Director’s Rule 2009-5. The calculated v/c
 ratios for the tested screenlines were determined to remain below the adopted LOS standard with the
 proposed development. Therefore, the proposed development was determined to meet the City of
 Seattle concurrency requirements.

 Parking. The peak parking demand for the office, restaurant, and retail uses is anticipated to be 371
 parking stalls at 11:00 a.m. on a weekday. This would be accommodated by the proposed 475
 stall parking supply. While peak parking for the restaurant may exceed supply after 7:00 p.m.,
 shared parking would accommodate peak parking demand throughout a weekday, and no parking
 spillover is anticipated. On-site parking for the office use is proposed at a ratio of 1.42 stalls per
 1,000 gsf. Since this exceeds the parking limit of 1 stall per 1,000 gsf for non-residential uses, a
 special exception to the code is proposed.

 Project Mitigation. The following describes the measures proposed to mitigate project impacts.

     1. South Lake Union Capital Improvement Project Contribution.
         The project is required to contribute payment for its share of South Lake Union capital
         improvement projects, as identified in the Seattle Department of Transportation’s South Lake
         Union Transportation Study. The pro-rata contribution for the proposed 400 Dexter Office
         project is $74,863 based on the number of PM peak hour trips generated by the proposed
         office, restaurant, and retail uses less the credit for removal of the existing on-site uses.

     2. Level of Service
         It is recommended that the City give consideration to east-west split phasing the
         Fairview/Republican intersection in the future to accommodate the anticipated pipeline
         development.

         It is recommended that the City consider re-optimizing green splits which would improve the
         LOS at the Fairview/Harrison intersection during the PM peak hour in the future.

     3. Parking
         None

     4. TMP
         A Transportation Manage Plan (TMP) will be required of the proposed office project, which
         will include goals to help reduce single-occupancy vehicle usage.

INTRODUCTION
     This traffic study documents the traffic impacts associated with the proposed 400 Dexter Office
     Development. The project site is located at 400 Dexter Avenue N on the southeast corner of Dexter
     and Republican Street; see also Figure 1 site vicinity map.

Project Description
     The proposed 400 Dexter Office Development includes up to 252,010 square feet (sf) of office
     space, up to 7,500 sf restaurant, and up to 10,000 sf of retail area (7,400 + 2,600 sf mezzanine).
     Vehicle access to/from the site would be provided on the alley located along the east side of the
     project site with access north and south to Republican and Harrison Streets as shown on the
     preliminary site plan concept in Figure 2.

     The existing site includes several commercial uses that will be removed, including Excellence Health
     and Wellness (7,342 sf health/fitness club), Ordo Templi (819 sf office for religious not for profit),
     EMFA (3,857 sf event space), Home Grown (11,188 sf manufacturing), and Seattle Automotive
     (12,000 sf automotive care center).

     The anticipated year of occupancy for the project is 2016.

Project Approach

             Dexter Avenue is a two-way street classified as a Minor Arterial. In the project vicinity, Dexter
             Avenue has sidewalks, buffered bike lanes, and parking on both sides of the street. Most
             City street intersections along Dexter Avenue are signalized with crosswalks. Channelization
             has been modified slightly to accommodate road construction near the project vicinity.
             Republican Street is a two-way street classified as Minor Arterial east of Dexter Avenue.
             Adjacent to the site, Republican Street in a non-arterial street with sidewalks on both sides
             and parking on the north side only.
             Harrison Street is a two-way street classified as a local Access Street. In the project vicinity,
             Harrison Street has sidewalks and parking is allowed on both sides of the street. Harrison
             Street from Aurora Ave N to 8th Ave N is currently closed to traffic due to roadway
             construction.

Transit Service
     The project site is served by Metro Transit. The nearest Metro Transit bus stop is located adjacent to
     the project site on the west side of Dexter Avenue just north of Harrison Street. The stop serves routes
     26, 28 with frequent service to/from downtown, Queen Anne, Fremont, Green Lake, and
     Broadview. There is currently no bus shelter for this stop. There are several other transit stops within
     a half-mile of the site on Mercer Street and Westlake Avenue. These public transit facilities provide
     frequent service to areas throughout the region.

     Two blocks east of the site on Westlake Avenue is the Seattle Street Car which provides service
     between South Lake Union and downtown. The Westlake Hub station in downtown provides a
     transfer point to the Seattle Transit Tunnel, which provides connection to transit services that serve the
     region.

Non-motorized Transportation Facilities
     Non-motorized transportation facilities in the project vicinity include sidewalks on all adjacent streets,
     crosswalks at signalized intersections, and bicycle lanes on Dexter Avenue. Dexter Avenue is
     considered a major bicycle facility in the Seattle Bicycling Map that provides signed and striped
     bicycle lanes on both sides between Fremont and downtown Seattle.

Existing Peak-Hour Traffic Volumes
     Existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections were collected by All Traffic Data in
     December 2013 and June 2014. Figure 3 illustrates the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at
     11 of the 13 study intersections; the two study intersections at the alley and 8th Avenue on Harrison
     were under construction so traffic count data was not available. The detailed traffic count data sheets
     are provided in Appendix A.

                2. Dexter Avenue / Harrison Street
                3. Dexter Avenue / Denney Way

     LOS generally refers to the degree of congestion on a roadway or intersection. It is a measure of
     vehicle operating speed, travel time, travel delays, and driving comfort. A letter scale from A to F
     generally describes intersection LOS. At signalized intersections, LOS A represents free-flow
     conditions (motorists experience little or no delays), and LOS F represents forced-flow conditions
     where motorists experience an average delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle.

     The LOS reported for signalized intersections represents the average control delay (sec/veh) and can
     be reported for the overall intersection, for each approach, and for each lane group or movement
     (additional v/c ratio criteria apply to lane group or movement LOS only). The LOS reported at two-
     way stop-controlled intersections is based on the average control delay and can be reported for each
     controlled minor approach, controlled minor lane group, and controlled major-street movement
     (additional v/c ratio criteria apply to lane group or movement LOS only). Table 1 outlines current
     HCM 2010 LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections based on these methods.

TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
Project Trip Generation
     The proposed 400 Dexter Office Development includes up to 252,010 square feet (sf) of office
     space, up to 7,500 sf restaurant, and up to 10,000 sf of retail area (7,400 + 2,600 sf mezzanine).
     The existing site includes several uses that will be removed, and trip generation credit was applied
     for the existing uses to be replaced.

     The weekday AM peak hour, PM peak hour, and daily trip generation estimate for the proposed
     office, restaurant, retail, and existing uses were based on trip rates published in the Institute of
     Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th edition. Local mode split adjustments
     were made to the trips associated with the proposed office and existing uses based on the 2012
     Center City Commuter Mode Split Survey Results for the South Lake Union Area (ref. Table 6), unless
     otherwise noted. The CTR-Affected Commute Mode Share was used for the proposed office use
     assuming a future TMP for the project, while the Non CTR-Affected Commute Mode Share was used
     for the existing uses. Three steps were used to calculate the trip generation for the proposed use and
     existing on-site uses to be removed.

     First, ITE trip rates were used to determine vehicular trip generation for the proposed uses. Vehicle
     trip generation was then converted to person trips using an average vehicle occupancy (AVO) factor
     of 1.10 for the proposed office and 1.20 for the proposed restaurant and retail.

     Second, local mode-split data was used to assign the person trips into the following categories:

                       Type                 Office            Restaurant/Retail
                       Non-Vehicle           16%                     50%
                       Transit               26%                     0%
                       Vehicle               58%                     50%

     Third, an AVO was applied to the person trips traveling by vehicle to obtain the number of vehicle
     trips. An AVO of 1.10 was assumed for the proposed office and an AVO of 1.20 was assumed
     for the proposed restaurant and retail. Since the assumed AVO are the same as those used in Step
     1 above, no reductions in trip generation were made as a result of AVO.

     Table 3 summarizes the weekday daily and peak hour trip generation for the proposed office
     development and restaurant/retail uses, as well as the trip generation for the existing uses that will
     be removed. The table also summarizes the net addition of trips based on the proposed less existing
     use. The detailed trip generation calculations are included in Attachment B.

     As shown in Table 3, the proposed development is estimated to generate a net addition of 1,325
     weekday trips per day, with 196 net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and
     175 net new trips occurring during the weekday PM peak hour.

Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
     The distribution of vehicle trips for the proposed office and restaurant/retail uses were estimated
     based on DPD Director’s Rule 2009-5 and general traffic patterns in the vicinity of the site. The
     distribution assumed that the SR-99 and North Portal improvements currently under construction in the
     project vicinity would be completed prior to the anticipated year of opening of the proposed
     development. The SR-99 North Portal improvements and SR-99 off-ramp north of the site are
     anticipated to be complete prior to 2016; the project year of opening is anticipated in 2016.

Future Traffic Volumes
     The year 2016 future without-project traffic volumes at the study intersections are based on weekday
     PM peak hour traffic volumes documented in the SR-99 North Access Connection EIS along with the
     addition of traffic from the following 19 pipeline projects (as directed by City staff):
         1. 810 Dexter
         2. 435 Dexter
         3. 501 Fairview
         4. 8th and Republican
         5. 325 9th Ave

         8. 777 Thomas St
         9. 528 Pontius Ave
         10. 1260 Republican St
         11. 500 Fairview Ave
         12. 221 Minor Ave N
         13. 222 Fairview Ave N
         14. 400 Boren Ave N
         15. 307 Fairview Ave N
         16. 400 Fairview Ave
         17. 420 Pontius Ave / 409 Yale Ave N / 1265 Republican St
         18. 300 8th Ave N
         19. 333 8th Ave N

     The City’s SR-99 North Access Connection Project will connect the SR-99 tunnel’s north entrance at
     Harrison Street to the existing roadway north of the Mercer Street bridge. It will also build new on-
     and off-ramps at Republican and Harrison Streets, extend Sixth Avenue North between Harrison and
     Mercer Streets. Future PM peak hour traffic volumes were developed in the Supplemental EIS from
     the SR-99 North Access Connection Project. These PM peak hour traffic volumes represented future
     traffic in year 2015-2016 in the vicinity of the 400 Dexter Office Development. The 2015-2016
     traffic volumes from the SR-99 North Access Connection SEIS were provided by Parsons Brinkerhoff,
     the City’s traffic consultant for the SEIS. Also provided were the future roadway network for the study
     area including the new Aurora Avenue corridor. The future 2015-2016 PM peak hour traffic volumes
     and roadway network changes from the SR-99 North Access Connection project are provided in
     Appendix C.

     The future 2016 without-project PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections were
     developed by adding the traffic from the 19 pipeline projects to the year 2015-2016 traffic volumes
     from the SR-99 North Access Connection project. The 2016 without-project traffic volumes are
     shown in Figure 5. Adding the trip assignment from the proposed 400 Dexter Office development
     (shown in Figure 4) to the future 2016 without-project traffic volumes results in the 2016 With-Project
     traffic volumes at the study intersections shown in Figure 6.

Future Level of Service
     Future LOS were evaluated at the 9 study intersections and 2 alley access intersections for the
     anticipated year of occupancy (2016). The future roadway network assumed in the year 2016 LOS
     analysis was based on future intersection geometry with the planned improvements associated with
     the SR-99 North Portal project. The signal timing was optimized at the new intersections along
     Dexter. The 2016 weekday PM peak hour LOS results at the study intersections are summarized in
     Table 4. The detailed LOS worksheets are included in Appendix C.

     The Dexter/Denny, Fairview/Mercer, and Fairview/Denny intersections have typically operated a
     LOS F and are anticipated to continue as they serve as gateway access points to/from the SLU area.
     The added traffic from the 400 Dexter office project is not anticipated to be significant.

     The Fairview/Republican intersection has recently experienced higher volumes of traffic and is
     expected to receive additional growth in pipeline development traffic from the SLU Area. As a result,
     this intersection is anticipated to operate at a poor LOS F in the future without the proposed 400
     Dexter office project based using existing signal timing provided by the City. Based on projected
     traffic growth, split-phasing the intersection in the east-west direction and maintaining the 160-second
     cycle would improve the intersection to LOS D operation in the PM peak hour with an average delay
     of about 55 seconds. As a result, it is recommended that the City give consideration to east-west split
     phasing at this intersection in the future to accommodate the anticipated pipeline development.

     The Fairview/Harrison intersection is also anticipated to accommodate increased traffic growth along
     Harrison due to pipeline development in the SLU area. As a result, the intersection is anticipated to
     operate in the LOS E during the PM peak hour with the proposed 400 Dexter office and other
     pipeline projects. Re-optimizing green splits would improve the LOS at this intersection during the
     PM peak hour in the future.

Site Access Analysis
     Vehicle access is proposed on the alley, which would provide access north to Republican Street and
     south to Harrison Street. All turning movements at the alley intersections with Republican and Harrison
     Streets are expected to operate at LOS D or better during the PM peak hour and shown in the
     previous LOS Table 4. The detailed LOS files at the alley driveways are included in Appendix D.

Future Transit Service
     The proposed office development would add new office employees to the vicinity area. While this
     project would increase the demand for transit service in the area, the transit capacity is expected to
     accommodate this increased demand with no significant adverse impact. Also, an increase in transit
     demand would be considered positive since this would result in a decrease in passenger cars on the
     surrounding road network.

Future Non-Motorized Facilities
     The demand on pedestrian facilities in the project vicinity is expected to increase with the proposed
     office development. While this project would increase the demand on pedestrian facilities, this
     increased demand is not expected to result in a significant adverse impact. Existing pedestrian
     facilities in the vicinity area (i.e. sidewalks) are sufficient to accommodate the additional pedestrian
     demand. Further, any increase in pedestrian demand would be considered positive since this would
     result in a decrease in passenger cars on the surrounding road network.

     The proposed project is anticipated to generate some bicycle trips. The project location adjacent to
     Dexter Avenue N provides convenient access to a major bicycle facility with signed and striped lanes
     on both sides. Secure bicycle storage will be provided for office employees to meet City code
     requirements. A total of 89 long-term spaces and 13 short-term spaces are proposed.

Transportation Concurrency
    Prior to development approval, a transportation concurrency analysis is conducted based on DPD
    Director’s Rule 2009-5. Transportation concurrency standards are used to determine the acceptable
    balance between the demand for use of the arterial systems and the capacity of the transportation
    system. Total capacity is based on the facilities currently in existence, and known future projects.

    Transportation concurrency review in the City of Seattle is evaluated first by determining applicable
    screenlines. A screenline is an imaginary line drawn across several arterials at a particular place
    where the volume to-capacity ratio (v/c) is calculated. For the 400 Dexter Office Development
    project, Screenline 5.12 (Ship Canal Fremont Bridge), Screenline 5.13 (Ship Canal Aurora Ave),
    and Screenline 8 (South Lake Union) were evaluated.

    Baseline peak-hour traffic volumes for the screenlines were obtained from Director’s Rule 2009-5.
    Project-generated traffic was then added to baseline traffic volumes at the screenlines. The total traffic
    volume, including PM peak hour trips from the proposed 400 Dexter Office Development project,
    was then divided by the capacity of all roadways crossing the screenlines to obtain a volume to
    capacity (v/c) ratio. This ratio was then compared to the LOS standard. Table 5 summarizes the
    transportation concurrency review results. As shown, the v/c ratios with the development are below
    the adopted LOS standard.

Parking Demand Analysis
    Peak parking demand for the office, restaurant, and retail uses was calculated based on information
    from the ITE Parking Generation manual (4th edition, year 2010) and local mode-share information
    for the SLU neighborhood. First, the ITE Parking Generation manual was used to identify suburban
    parking demand rates for office, restaurant, and retail uses. Then, mode share projections for CTR-
    Affected companies were used from in the Center City Commuter Mode Split Survey Results (Gilmore
    Research Group) to estimate mode-share for the proposed uses.

     The mode-share indicates that about 58 percent of the trips generated in the SLU area would be
     made by vehicle (including single-occupant vehicles and carpools/vanpools). However, the
     proposed TMP for the project will have an SOV goal of 50 percent for the office use. As a result,
     the suburban parking rate (2.84) was factored by the projected TMP vehicle mode share (50%),
     resulting in an adjusted parking demand rate for the project area of about 1.42 vehicles per 1,000
     gsf of office building area. Using the adjusted 1.42 parking demand rate would result in a peak
     weekday parking demand of 358 stalls for the office use based on 252,010 square feet of office
     area.

     The ITE parking demand rate for suburban “quality restaurant” is 10.6, and parking demand for
     suburban retail is 2.55 vehicles per 1,000 gsf. To determine peak parking demand, the 50 percent
     vehicle mode-share was also applied to the suburban parking demand rate. The detailed calculations
     are provided in Appendix E.

     Additionally, peak parking for office, retail, and restaurant occur at different times during a typical
     weekend. An hourly estimate of peak parking demand was estimated using parking demand and
     utilization information from the ITE Parking Generation manual. The hourly parking demand profile
     is included in Appendix E. As shown, with a shared parking concept, the peak demands of the
     office, restaurant, and retail uses would be accommodated within the proposed 475-stall parking
     garage. With the shared parking concept, the additional parking demand for the restaurant use
     after 7:00 p.m. is anticipated to utilize available on-site parking from the office use.

     The peak parking demand is anticipated to be 371 parking stalls at 11:00 a.m. on a weekday.
     This would be accommodated by the proposed 475 stall parking supply. While peak parking for
     the restaurant may exceed supply after 7:00 p.m., shared parking would accommodate the peak
     parking demand throughout a weekday, and no parking spillover is anticipated. On-site parking for
     the office use is proposed at a ratio of 1.42 stalls per 1,000 gsf. Since this exceeds the parking
     limit of 1 stall per 1,000 gsf for non-residential uses, a special exception to the code is proposed

Justification for Parking Supply Increase
     On-site parking for the office use is proposed at a ratio of approximately 1.42 stalls per 1,000 gsf
     for a total of approximately 358 parking stalls. This exceeds the parking limit of 1 stall per 1,000
     gsf for non-residential uses as outlined in the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) section 23.48.032.B.1.
     As a result, a special exception to the code is proposed.

PROJECT MITIGATION MEASURES
South Lake Union Capital Improvement Project Contribution
      The project is required to contribute payment for its share of South Lake Union capital improvement
      projects, as identified in the Seattle Department of Transportation’s South Lake Union Transportation
      Plan. Improvements in the Plan provide improved facilities for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, and
      transit users. The transportation mitigation for the 400 Dexter Office project was estimated using the
      SLU Pro-Rata methodology, which was developed consistent with DPD TIP#243 (Transportation
      Mitigation Payments).

      The pro-rata calculations for the proposed 400 Dexter Office development were made based on up
      to 252,010 gsf office, up to 7,500 sf restaurant, and up to 10,000 sf retail area (7,400 + 2,600
      sf mezzanine), and credit for the existing uses that will be removed. The resulting pro-rata contribution
      is estimated at $74,863 based on the number of PM peak hour trips generated by the proposed
      office, restaurant, and retail uses less the credit for removal of the existing uses. If the proposed
      building areas are reduced at the time of building permit application, the pro-rata mitigation cost
      would also be less. The detailed pro-rata mitigation calculations are provided in Appendix F.

Level of Service
      The Fairview/Republican intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour
      due to increased growth in pipeline development traffic from the SLU Area. Split-phasing the
      intersection in the east-west direction and maintaining the 160-second cycle would improve the
      intersection to LOS D operation in the PM peak hour with an average delay of about 55 seconds.
      As a result, it is recommended that the City give consideration to east-west split phasing at this
      intersection in the future to accommodate the anticipated pipeline development.

      The Fairview/Harrison intersection is also anticipated to accommodate increased traffic growth along
      Harrison due to pipeline development in the SLU area. As a result, the intersection is anticipated to
      operate in the LOS E during the PM peak hour with the proposed 400 Dexter office and other
      pipeline projects. It is recommended that the City consider re-optimizing green splits which would
      improve the LOS at this intersection during the PM peak hour in the future.

Parking
      The peak parking demand is anticipated to be 371 parking stalls at 11:00 a.m. on a weekday.
      This would be accommodated by the proposed 475 stall parking supply. While peak parking for
      the restaurant may exceed supply after 7:00 p.m., shared parking would accommodate peak
      parking demand throughout a weekday, and no parking spillover is anticipated. On-site parking for
      the office use is proposed at a ratio of 1.42 stalls per 1,000 gsf. Since this exceeds the parking
      limit of 1 stall per 1,000 gsf for non-residential uses, a special exception to the code is proposed.

TMP
      Based on the proposed use as an office development, a Transportation Manage Plan (TMP) will be
      required, which will include goals to help reduce single-occupancy vehicle usage.

Notes:
1. Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation manual, 9th Edition, 2012 Land Use Code.
2. AVO = Average Vehicle Occupancy. No adjustments were made to trip generation due to AVO.
3. Mode-split based on 2012 Center City Commuter Mode Split Survey Results. Proposed use CTR-affected data, existing use non-CTR-affected data.
4. Pass-by trips determined based on methodology included in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition.
5. No trip credit was applied for the event space.
6. Daily trip rate based on a k-factor of 10 with respect to the PM peak hour trip rate. 10*3.11=31.10.
