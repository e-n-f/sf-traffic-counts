 Subject:         Traffic Evaluation of Pioneer Avenue Neighborhood Plan


 Dear Mr. Loving:

 At your request, TJKM has reviewed the traffic and parking aspects of the proposed 46-unit for
 sale townhome development to be located on Pioneer Avenue south of Geary Road in the City
 of Walnut Creek. The 2.57-acre project is located at the 90 degree bend in Pioneer Avenue
 beginning about 200 feet south of the center of Geary Road. The project displaces some five
 existing homes; however, under existing R-8 development in the City of Walnut Creek, 17 single
 family homes are allowable.

 Pioneer Avenue is a 1,125 foot long roadway with a right angle bend. It extends 385 feet
 southerly from Geary Road and 740 feet easterly from Hall Lane to an L-intersection. The project
 would remove about 350 feet of public roadway from the middle portion of Pioneer Avenue.
 This roadway would be abandoned. Cul-de-sacs would be provided at both ends of the closure,
 although vehicular access to the site would be entirely from the north portion of Pioneer
 Avenue.

 Traffic Issues

 The roadway has a curb to curb width of about 36 feet with parking allowable on both sides of
 the street, except in the center section of the roadway near the 90 degree bend. In this area, the
 pavement width is reduced to about 20 to 24 feet. Based on recent peak hour counts conducted
 at the intersection of Pioneer Avenue and Geary Road, the estimated daily traffic on Pioneer
 south of that intersection is 435 vehicles per day.

 TJKM developed estimated project trip generation for the proposed project based on published
 trip generation rates from the ITE publication Trip Generation (9th Edition). TJKM applied trip
 discounts to the proposed project trip generation for the existing seven single family homes on
 the project site. The trip generation estimates were developed using the ITE codes for “Single
 Family Detached Housing” (ITE Land Use 210) and “Residential Townhouse” (ITE Land Use 230).

As shown in Table 1, the proposed development will generate a net total of 201 new daily trips,
14 in the a.m. peak hour and 17 in the p.m. peak hour. The project displaces seven existing
residences.

Table 2 compares the trip generation from the proposed project with that of the allowable 17
single family homes that could be built on the same site under the existing zoning designation
of R-8 with a PD. There would be 105 daily trips added by the proposed re-designation, but only
seven additional a.m. peak hour trips and seven additional p.m. peak hour trip.

Table 3 shows that the existing level of service at the nearby-signalized intersection of Geary
Road and Pioneer Avenue and the unsignalized intersection Geary Road and Hall Lane do not
change as the result of the development of the proposed project.

Although there have been complaints of non-neighborhood traffic using Pioneer Avenue to visit
the Sprouts shopping center located on the northern extension of Pioneer Avenue at Geary
Road, there were no observed vehicles making a northbound movement from Pioneer Avenue in
either the a.m. or p.m. peak periods. Sprouts is open for business during both peak hours.
Existing and Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown
in the appendix.




Neighborhood Circulation

The existing neighbors have reported some issues with through traffic and with parking. There
is currently in place a neighborhood residential parking permit plan which prohibits daytime
parking for those without a permit. In addition, neighbors have complaints about outsiders
using Pioneer Avenue as a short-cut to reach the Sprouts shopping center. As noted above, no
through traffic was observed in the a.m. and p.m. peak periods.

After the two cul-de-sacs are installed on Pioneer Avenue as a part of the project, circulation will
be changed for seven homes that front onto Pioneer Avenue east of Hall Lane. Those homes will
                                                                                        Jerry Loving
                                                                                December 20, 2016
                                                                                         Page 4 of 4
need to use Hall Lane to travel to and from their homes. Currently, at least some of those trips
are being made on Pioneer Avenue to access Geary Road. However, the reduced access will be
offset by the removal of all through traffic on Pioneer Avenue due to the new cul-de-sacs. At
the same time, there will be an increase in traffic on Hall Lane from that portion of the existing
Pioneer Avenue traffic that will be diverted to Hall Lane. Hall Lane has a curb to curb width of
36 feet with parking allowed on both sides, so it is capable of carrying additional traffic.

For information purposes, there is a 70-unit senior apartment complex whose entire access is on
Pioneer Avenue just south of Geary Road. This development likely contributes a major portion of
existing and future traffic on this section of Pioneer Avenue.

     Hall Lane south of Geary Road                 610                           670


Table 4 indicates the existing daily traffic volumes on Pioneer Avenue south of Geary Road, on
Geary Road west of Pioneer Avenue, and on Hall Lane south of Geary Road. It also shows the
volumes at the same locations after the new project and the two cul-de-sacs are placed on
Pioneer Avenue by the project.

Overall, it appears the development of the proposed 46 townhomes on Pioneer Avenue will
have minimal impacts on traffic in the neighborhood.

 Technical Memorandum

 Date:      January 23, 2016

 To:        Yun Na Rhee
            Assistant Engineer
            City of Walnut Creek
            1666 N. Main Street
            Walnut Creek, CA, 94596.


 From:      Chris Kinzel                                   Jurisdiction:   City of Walnut Creek


 Subject:   Pioneer Avenue TIS responses to the comments provided by City of Walnut
            Creek dated January 17, 2017.

   1. Please discuss the minimal difference for peak turn counts from existing to existing plus
      project.(peak time difference in volume seem to be max difference of four vehicles yet
      Table 4 daily traffic volumes show a difference of max 95-vehicle increase).

Response: The minimal difference for peak turn counts from the existing and existing plus
project on the south leg of the intersection of Geary Blvd and Hall Lane for the a.m. peak hour is
9 trips and p.m. peak hour is 6 trips in both directions. As the 24-hour average daily traffic was
not conducted at Geary Road, ADT was calculated by using standard practice a.m. peak hour
traffic in both directions plus p.m. peak hour traffic in both directions multiplied by 5, which
shows an increase of 95 vehicles as the project traffic is added on Geary Road. In this Existing
plus project scenario, it is also assumed that due to the construction of cul-de-sacs the existing
seven homes west of the project site would use Hall Lane.

   2. Please discuss the values from table 4. For example it states that 435 vehicle trips were
      made inbound and outbound at Geary/Pioneer. If the project occurs, it will block the
      flow of traffic yet the table mentions volumes will increase to 530 vehicles to this
      roadway. Please also consider that if the 435 trips are now blocked on Pioneer Ave. they
      would need to traverse through Hall/Geary, would that not increase trips to that
      intersection? Please clarify for all street segments mentioned on this table.

Response: It should be noted that there are other residential uses which have access via Pioneer
Avenue and Table 4 represent average daily traffic generated by the project and other
residential uses. Based on the site plan, only seven homes west of the project site won’t be able

to use Pioneer Avenue, the rest of all the existing single family homes, apartments, town homes
and the proposed project will use Pioneer Avenue. There are very busy driveways immediately
south of Geary Road that will not be blocked off.

   3. Please indicate the source of the turn movement diagrams. They look like they are from
      the attached Synchro 9 Report.

Response: The turning movement counts were conducted by IDAX on 10/20/206 for the
intersection of Geary Road and Pioneer Avenue and on 12/06/2016 for the intersection of Hall
Lane and Geary Blvd. The turn movement diagrams illustrates count date and count firm
information. The counts were used in the Synchro 9 software for the analysis purpose.

   4. Please indicate why the Synchro 9 Report PM existing counts were not used for the Hall
   Ln/Geary Rd diagram but all other counts (AM for Hall/Geary and AM/PM for Pioneer/Geary)

Response: The existing counts collected from the field (turn movement diagrams) were used for
the analysis purposes for the study intersections for a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

   5. Report mentions that there are no vehicles observed for Pioneer northbound at Geary
      Rd, please indicate and provide how many days this was observed. There should be at
      least 3 days of observation.

Response:

We cannot recall ever making peak hour counts for more than one day in Walnut Creek or
elsewhere. On the day of the count, there were no northbound through movements. As can be
seen, traffic enters and leaves the site from different directions during various peak hours. We
are not sure why there is a concern about zero movements. It should be noted that whatever
the count is assumed for these movements, the level of service is very acceptable and is not
likely to change. Despite stories from local residents about lots of through traffic on Pioneer
cutting through to reach Sprouts, there is no evidence of this in the counts, at least during peak
hours.


Please contact me if there are questions about these comments.
