Subject:       1409 El Camino Real Residential and Retail Development Traffic Study
               (DPC2015-12; TM2015-09)


Introduction
This memorandum presents the results of the traffic study conducted for the proposed residential
and retail development located at 1409 El Camino Real in Redwood City, California. The project
site is located at the southeast corner of El Camino Real (SR 82) and Diller Street. Throughout this
memorandum, El Camino Real is referred to as a north-south street. The approximately 1.6-acre
project site is currently occupied by an auto repair shop, veterinary hospital, hair salon, treadmill
outlet and office building. The proposed project would demolish the existing buildings on site and
construct an 8-story 350-unit apartment building with 5,972 square feet of ground floor retail space
above three levels of parking (2.5 below grade level). Access to the project would be provided via
two driveways, one on Franklin Street and one on an alley along the southern edge of the property
that connects to El Camino Real. The Franklin Street driveway provides access to basement
parking levels 2 and 3. The El Camino Real driveway provides access to the basement parking
level 1. Circulation between the basement parking level 1 and the lower parking levels would
require vehicles to exit the garage and re-enter again from the other driveway. Figure 1 presents
the project location and study intersections. The project site plan is shown on Figures 2 through 4.
The traffic study presents the project trip generation, project trip distribution and assignment, an
evaluation of potential impacts generated by project traffic on key intersections, a review of site
access, an assessment of bike and pedestrian facilities, and an evaluation of the possible removal
of the right-turn lane on northbound El Camino Real at Diller Street.

Project Trip Generation
Trip generation for the land uses set forth in the Redwood City Downtown Precise Plan (DPP) was
calculated using the Mixed-Use Development (MXD) model developed by Fehr & Peers, EPA, and
ITE. The MXD model utilized the ITE trip generation rates for the initial estimate, and then
calculated a trip reduction percentage to estimate the effect of mixed-use development in the
downtown area based on various socio-economic variables. This reduction included bicycle and
walking trips within the downtown area. Additional trip reductions from standard ITE rates were
applied to account for transit uses within the downtown area. The complete process is outlined in
the Redwood City Downtown Precise Plan Draft Environmental Impact Report (DPP DEIR), August
27, 2010.

Since this project is located within the DPP area, trip generation for this project was estimated using
the same process as described above. However, the base trip rates used in this study are from the
latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, while the trip generation estimates contained in the
DPP DEIR were based on an older version. Hexagon compared the trips generated by the existing
uses currently on site to the trips that would be generated by the proposed residential and
commercial mixed-use development. The trips generated by the existing buildings on the site were
obtained from driveway counts completed on Wednesday, March 23, 2016. Based on the driveway
counts, the existing buildings on site generate 31 trips during the AM peak hour and 38 trips during
the PM peak hour. These trips were deducted from the estimated number of trips generated by the
proposed new development, which results in a net increase of 117 trips in the AM peak hour and
139 trips in the PM peak hour. The trip generation estimates are presented in Table 1.

Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
The project trip distribution and assignment for the proposed development at 1409 El Camino Real
were estimated based on the patterns presented in the DPP DEIR. The project trip assignment and
distribution contained in the DPP DEIR were developed based on a citywide travel demand
forecasting model, supplemented by information about existing patterns, anticipated roadway
network characteristics, and surrounding land use pattern. The project trip distribution patterns and
net project trip assignment are shown on Figure 5.

Impact Evaluation of Project Traffic
The potential impacts of the proposed project were evaluated by assigning the project generated
trips to seven intersections in the vicinity of the project site. Four of the seven study intersections
were previously analyzed in the DPP DEIR.
The seven study intersections are listed below:
   1. El Camino Real (SR 82) & Jefferson Avenue*
   2. El Camino Real (SR 82) & Diller Street (unsignalized)
   3. Franklin Street & Maple Street (unsignalized)
   4. Middlefield Road & Jefferson Avenue*
   5. Middlefield Road & Main Street*
   6. Main Street & WB Woodside Road (unsignalized)*
   7. El Camino Real (SR 82) & EB Woodside Road (unsignalized)
* Denotes intersections analyzed in DPP DEIR

Analysis of Downtown Precise Plan (DPP) Intersections
For intersections previously analyzed in the DPP DEIR, the trips generated by the proposed
development at 1409 El Camino Real were compared to the cumulative DPP trips. This comparison
was used to determine whether the project would create new impacts or worsen the intersection
impacts already identified in the DPP. Table 2 summarizes the cumulative level of service (LOS) for
buildout of the DPP, the total number of trips added by the proposed project at 1409 El Camino
Real and by the cumulative DPP, and a qualitative assessment of how the project trips would affect
intersection operations.
The qualitative assessment of the project trips effect on intersection operations were based on the
criteria described below.
   Minimal Effect:     The project would have minimal effect on intersection operations if the
                       projected future intersection operations in the DPP DEIR is LOS A, B, C, or
                       D, and the project adds fewer than 40 peak-hour trips, or
                       The projected future intersection operations in the DPP DEIR is LOS
                       E or F, and the project adds fewer than 20 peak-hour trips.
   Moderate Effect: The project would have a moderate effect on intersection operations if the
                    projected future intersection operations in the DPP DEIR is LOS E or F and
                    the project adds more than 20 peak-hour trips.

All four of the study intersections evaluated in the DPP DEIR are expected to operate at LOS E or F
during one or both peak hours under the DPP cumulative volumes. The proposed development at
1409 El Camino Real adds relatively little traffic to each of the study intersections and the proposed
project trips fall within the DPP trips. Therefore, the project is not likely to create any new impacts to
the intersection operations.
El Camino Real and Jefferson Avenue
Under the cumulative DPP buildout traffic volumes, the intersection of El Camino Real and
Jefferson Avenue would operate at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) during the AM and PM peak
hours. The incremental increase in delay caused by the DPP was identified as a significant
cumulative impact. Mitigation 9-11 from the DPP DEIR states that addition of an exclusive
eastbound left-turn lane on Jefferson Avenue would reduce this cumulative impact to a less-than-
significant level. Any improvements within the El Camino Real (SR 82) right-of-way would require
Caltrans approval. However, the City’s General Plan has Pedestrian Enhanced Design (PED)
policies and programs that emphasize pedestrian and bicycle travel within the downtown area, and
implementation of this mitigation could conflict with the PED policies. Therefore this mitigation could
be considered infeasible as a result of this policy conflict. Thus, the DPP DEIR concludes that the
impact at the intersection of El Camino Real and Jefferson Avenue is significant and unavoidable.
Middlefield Road and Jefferson Avenue
Under the cumulative DPP buildout traffic volumes, the intersection of Middlefield Road and
Jefferson Avenue would operate at an unacceptable LOS F during the PM peak hour. The DPP
DEIR identified the incremental increase in delay caused by the DPP as a significant cumulative
impact. Mitigation 9-13 from the DPP DEIR states that the impact could be reduced to a less than
significant level by restriping the southbound approach of Middlefield Road to provide one through
lane and one right turn lane, and prohibiting southbound left turns (from Middlefield Road to
Jefferson Avenue, towards Broadway). This mitigation has been added to the Redwood City Traffic
Impact Mitigation Fee (TIF) projects list and will be implemented pending collection of fees.
Middlefield Road and Main Street
Under the cumulative DPP buildout traffic volumes, the intersection of Middlefield Road and Main
Street would operate at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) during the AM and PM peak hours. The
increase in delay associated with buildout of the DPP is expected to cause a significant cumulative
impact. Mitigation 9-14 from the DPP DEIR states that the impact could be satisfactorily mitigated
                                                                                              Page | 9

by restriping the northbound and southbound Middlefield Road approaches to this intersection to
one left-turn lane and one shared through/right-turn lane. This would allow the signal operation to
change from the current split-phase operation on the north and south approaches to protected left-
turn phasing. This mitigation has been added to the Redwood City Traffic Impact Mitigation Fee
(TIF) projects list and will be implemented pending collection of fees.
Main Street and Woodside Road Westbound Ramp
Under the cumulative DPP buildout traffic volumes, the intersection of Main Street and the
Woodside Road westbound ramp intersection would operate at an unacceptable LOS F during the
AM and PM peak hours. The incremental increase in delay caused by the DPP was identified as a
significant cumulative impact. Mitigation 9-12 from the DPP states that signalization would improve
the intersection operations to LOS B during the AM and PM peak hours, satisfactorily mitigating the
cumulative impact. This mitigation has been added to the Redwood City Traffic Impact Mitigation
Fee (TIF) projects list. Because the improvement is within the Woodside Road (SR 84) right-of-way,
it will require Caltrans approval. If Caltrans does not approve, and the City cannot implement these
improvements, then this impact would be significant and unavoidable.

Analysis of Other (non DPP) Intersections
The following three study intersections were not evaluated in the Downtown Precise Plan DEIR:
      El Camino Real (SR 82) & Diller Street (unsignalized)
      Franklin Street & Maple Street (unsignalized)
      El Camino Real (SR 82) & EB Woodside Road (unsignalized)
The potential project impacts at these intersections were evaluated based on the AM and PM peak
hour level of service for each intersection in accordance with the standards set forth by the City of
Redwood City
Traffic conditions at these study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak
hours of adjacent street traffic. In the study area, the AM peak hour typically occurs between 7:00
AM and 9:00 AM, while the PM peak hour typically occurs between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.
Traffic conditions were analyzed under the scenarios described below.

Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new manual turning
               movement counts.
Scenario 2:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Project-generated traffic was added to existing
               traffic volumes to estimate the existing plus project conditions. Existing plus project
               conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in order to determine
               potential project impacts.
Scenario 3:    Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
               existing volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
               developments and proposed developments in the project area. The list of approved
               and proposed projects was obtained from the City of Redwood City’s website and
               confirmed by the City’s planning staff.
Scenario 4:    Background Plus Project Conditions. Project-generated traffic was added to
               background traffic volumes to estimate the background plus project conditions.
               Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions
               in order to determine potential project impacts.

El Camino Real & Diller Residential Development – Traffic Study                                       April 29, 2015


The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, the City of Redwood City,
previous traffic studies, and the Redwood City Downtown Precise Plan (DPP) Draft EIR. The
following data were collected from these sources:
      Existing traffic volumes
      Existing lane configurations
      Existing signal timing
      List of approved and proposed projects
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of
Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow
conditions with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. Intersection
levels of service were calculated using the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology for
unsignalized intersections.
For stop-controlled intersections, level of service depends on the average delay experienced by
vehicles that must stop or yield to on-coming traffic. Thus, for two-way or T-intersections, operations
are defined by the average control delay experienced by vehicles entering the intersection from the
stop-controlled approaches on minor streets or from left-turn movements on major streets. Table 3
summarizes the relationship between LOS and average delay for unsignalized intersections.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria
used to determine significant impacts on unsignalized intersections are based on Redwood City
level-of-service standards. The effects of the project on other transportation facilities, such as
bicycle facilities and transit service, were determined on the basis of engineering judgment.
According to common Redwood City practice, traffic impacts at an unsignalized intersection would
be considered significant if the project would cause:
   1. Operations at an unsignalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or
      better) to an unacceptable level (LOS E or F); or
   2. The delay at an unsignalized intersection operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E of F) to
      increase by five (5) or more seconds;
                                                                                                         Page | 11

A significant impact by the Redwood City standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when
measures are implemented that eliminates the project impact.
Existing Conditions
For the three study intersections not included in the DPP DEIR, Hexagon evaluated levels of
service under existing conditions based on new turning-movement counts collected in March and
April 2016. The existing lane configurations at these study intersections are shown on Figure 6. The
existing traffic volumes at these study intersections are shown on Figure 7.
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in
Table 4. The results show that all three study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of
service during both the AM and PM peak hours. The level of service calculation sheets are included
in the Appendix.

Trip generation estimates for the above listed projects are shown in the Appendix. Background
traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing volumes the projected volumes from the above

The background transportation network is assumed to be the same as the existing transportation
network.
The results of the level of service analysis under background conditions for the three study
intersections not previously evaluated in the DPP DEIR are summarized in Table 5. The results
show that all but one intersection would operate at acceptable levels of service during the AM and
PM peak hours. The intersection of El Camino Real and EB Woodside Road is expected to degrade
from acceptable levels (LOS D) to an unacceptable level (LOS E) during the PM peak hour due to
the traffic added by other approved and proposed projects. The level of service calculation sheets
are included in the Appendix.

Project Condition Traffic Volumes
Project impacts were evaluated relative to both (1) existing traffic volumes, and (2) background
traffic volumes. For the existing plus project scenario, projected peak-hour traffic volumes with the
project were estimated by adding the new trips generated by the proposed project to existing traffic
volumes. For the background plus project scenario, projected peak-hour traffic volumes with the
project were estimated by adding the trips generated by the proposed project to background traffic
volumes. The project condition traffic volumes at the study intersections for the existing plus project
and background plus project conditions are shown on Figures 9 and 10, respectively.

Project Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project and background
plus project conditions are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. The level of service calculation sheets
are included in the Appendix. Under existing plus project conditions, the results show that all three
study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM
peak hours. The project would have an insignificant impact under existing plus project conditions
based on the significance criteria established by the City of Redwood City.
Under background plus project conditions, the results show that two study intersections would
continue to operate at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours. The yield-
controlled westbound approach at the intersection of El Camino Real and eastbound Woodside
Road is expected to operate at an unacceptable LOS E during the PM peak hour under background
conditions with or without the proposed project due to the trips that would be generated by other
approved and proposed developments in the vicinity. The proposed project at 1409 El Camino Real
would cause the average delay at this intersection to increase by less than 5 seconds per vehicle.
Therefore, the proposed project is considered to have an insignificant impact on this intersection
under background plus project conditions.

El Camino Real & Diller Residential Development – Traffic Study                             April 29, 2015



El Camino Real/Diller Street Right Turn Analysis
The intersection of El Camino Real and Diller Street was analyzed to determine if the existing
and/or future traffic volumes warrant preservation of the existing right-turn lane on the northbound
El Camino Real approach. Currently, the El Camino Real/Diller intersection is unsignalized with
stop control on the east (Diller Street) approach. El Camino Real has two through lanes in each
direction with a raised median that limits turns to and from Diller Street to right turns only. The City
of Redwood City has recommended the removal of the existing right-turn lane on northbound El
Camino Real and the addition of on-street parallel parking. The purpose of the change is to improve
the pedestrian environment along El Camino Real. The modification would create a buffer between
the sidewalk and the through travel lanes, and thus encourage walking to downtown destinations
including the Redwood City Transit Center and Caltrain Station. Furthermore, the addition of on-
street parking would be a benefit to nearby commercial uses along El Camino Real. It should be
noted that the proposed project at 1409 El Camino Real would provide sufficient parking on site for
the proposed uses and would not need the additional on-street parking. El Camino Real, SR 82, is
a state highway; therefore, the El Camino/Diller intersection is under Caltrans jurisdiction. Caltrans
recently approved the removal of the right-turn lane on the northbound El Camino Real approach at
Wilson Street, approximately 250 feet north of Diller Street.
As shown on Figure 7, the existing right-turn volume on the northbound El Camino Real approach
to Diller Street is extremely low with only 8 vehicles per hour during the AM peak hour and 16
vehicles per hour during the PM peak hour. The number of pedestrians crossing Diller Street on the
east leg of the intersection also was quite low with only 17 and 18 pedestrians in the AM and PM
peak hour, respectively. During the AM peak hour, there were 11 bicyclists on the northbound
approach, while there were only 3 bikes during the PM peak hour.
Under background plus project conditions, the right-turn volume on northbound El Camino Real at
Diller Street would remain essentially unchanged during the AM peak hour and increase slightly to
18 vehicles during the PM peak hour.
An analysis of traffic operations at the El Camino Real/Diller Street intersection under background
plus project conditions was conducted without the northbound right-turn lane, as recommended by
the City. The analysis was conducted using the TRAFFIX software based on the methodology
contained in Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000. The HCM methodology computes the average
delay (seconds per vehicle) for the controlled movements (the westbound right-turn movement).
The level of service calculation sheets are attached. The analysis results show that the stop-
controlled westbound approach on Diller Street currently operates at LOS B. The traffic added by
nearby developments and the removal of the northbound right-turn lane is expected to result in a
minimal increase (only 0.1 seconds per vehicle) in the average delay.
Right-turn lanes are sometimes provided on a major street at a two-way stop-controlled intersection
to improve operations and safety. A right-turn lane separates vehicles that are slowing to turn from
vehicles in the adjacent through traffic lanes. This separation minimizes turn-related collisions and
eliminates unnecessary delay to through vehicles. The potential benefits to operations and safety
should be weighed against the improved pedestrian environment and increased public parking
supply that would be gained by removing the existing right-turn lane on El Camino Real.
Neither Caltrans nor AASHTO provide guidance on when a right-turn lane is warranted at an
unsignalized intersection. The National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 457
provides guidance for determining the need for a major road right-turn bay at a two-way stop-
controlled intersection. However, this source is limited to high speed roads between 40 and 60
miles per hour. The speed limit on El Camino Real is 35 miles per hour. Extrapolation of the trend
lines to the lower speed found on El Camino Real indicates that the projected traffic volumes would
not justify a right-turn lane. Transportation Research Record 855 provides right-turn lane guidelines
                                                                                               Page | 20
El Camino Real & Diller Residential Development – Traffic Study                            April 29, 2015


for four-lane highways. The guidelines are intended for application on high speed highways and
thus are conservative when applied to a relatively low-speed urban setting such as El Camino Real.
Nevertheless, the guidelines indicate that right-turn lanes are not justified when the right-turn
volume is less than 40 vehicles per hour.
Based on the low number of right turns projected on northbound El Camino Real at Diller Street, the
City’s recommendation to eliminate the existing right-turn lane and provide on-street parking
appears to be justified. The modification is expected to have a negligible effect on traffic operations
and safety since right-turn traffic volumes would continue to be extremely low even after nearby
developments are built and fully occupied.
Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service in the study area is provided by the San Mateo County Transit District
(SamTrans) and Caltrain. The transit services are in Table 8 and shown on Figure 11.
The FLX line provides fixed bus service between the Redwood City Transit Center and the San
Carlos Caltrain Station via Industrial Road and Alameda de las Pulgas. The line operates with 4
buses during the AM peak hour with a 60-minute headway in the clockwise direction. The line
operates with 5 buses during the PM peak hour with a 50-minute headway in the counterclockwise
direction. Customers can arrange for pick up and drop off services throughout San Carlos outside of
the fixed schedules.
Within the project area, the 275, 278, and ECR lines all stop on El Camino Real north of Diller
Street, approximately 500 feet from the project site. The 270, 275, 276, 278, 296, 297, 397, RMH
and ECR lines all stop on El Camino Real north of Jefferson Avenue, approximately 1,000 feet from
the project site. The KX and 398 lines both stop on El Camino Real north of James Avenue,
approximately 2,000 feet from the project site. The FLX and RWC Mid Point Caltrain Shuttle both
stop on Winslow Street west of Broadway, approximately ½ mile from the project site.

Caltrain
Caltrain provides commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy. The project is located
approximately 1,800 feet south of the Redwood City Caltrain station, which is located near the
intersection of California Street and Broadway in downtown Redwood City. At the Redwood City
station, Caltrain provides service with 6 to 49 minute headways during the weekday commute
hours. All of the above listed bus lines provide services to the Redwood City Transit Center, which
is immediately next to the Redwood City Caltrain Station. Continuous sidewalks are available along
El Camino Real and James Avenue for pedestrians walking between the project site and the
Redwood City Caltrain Station.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Connectivity to Transit Facilities
The City of Redwood City has requested a review of pedestrian and bicycle facilities between the
project site and nearby transit stops to determine if improvements are warranted.
Pedestrian Connectivity to Transit Facilities
Transit Stop on Southbound El Camino Real
The nearest transit stop on southbound El Camino Real is located north of Wilson Street, and
provides bus services for lines 275, 278, and ECR. This transit stop is on the other side of El
Camino Real from the project site. El Camino Real has a landscaped median and no mid-block
crosswalks in the immediate vicinity. Pedestrians accessing the transit stop would walk north along
El Camino Real, west across the south leg crosswalk at the intersection of El Camino Real and
Jefferson Avenue, and south along El Camino Real. The walking distance is approximately 800
feet. Along this walking route, sidewalks are present along both sides of El Camino Real, and
crosswalks are provided at all intersections. Crosswalks at the intersection of El Camino Real and
Jefferson Avenue are all equipped with pedestrian signal heads and include ADA-compliant curb
ramps. Therefore, pedestrian connectivity is continuous between the project site and the transit stop
on southbound El Camino Real north of Wilson Street.
Transit Stop on Northbound El Camino Real
The nearest transit stop on northbound El Camino Real is located north of Jefferson Avenue
approximately 1,000 feet from the project site. This transit stop provides bus services for lines 270,
275, 276, 278, 296, 297, 397, and ECR. This transit stop is on the same side of El Camino Real as
the project site. Sidewalk is provided along northbound El Camino Real, and crosswalks are
provided at all intersections. Crosswalks at the intersection of El Camino Real and Jefferson
Avenue are all equipped with pedestrian signal heads and include ADA-compliant curb ramps.
Therefore, pedestrian connectivity is continuous between the project site and the transit stop on
northbound El Camino Real north of Jefferson Avenue.
Redwood City Transit Center
The Redwood City Transit Center is located southeast of the intersection of California Street and
Broadway, approximately 2,100 feet from the project site. All of the above listed bus lines provide
services to the Redwood City Transit Center. Pedestrians accessing the transit center would walk
north along El Camino Real, and east along James Avenue. Sidewalks are provided on both sides
of El Camino Real and James Avenue, and crosswalks are provided at all intersections. Crosswalks
at the intersections on El Camino Real at Jefferson Avenue, and at James Avenue are all equipped
with pedestrian signal heads and include ADA-compliant curb ramps. At the eastern end of James
Avenue, there exists a crosswalk connecting the Transit Center to the shopping center south of
James Avenue (Sequoia Station). Pedestrian connectivity between the project site and the transit
center is continuous along this route.


                                                                                              Page | 24
El Camino Real & Diller Residential Development – Traffic Study                            April 29, 2015


Alternatively, pedestrians could walk north along Franklin Street, north through the shopping center,
and access the transit center via the crosswalk along the eastern end of James Avenue. Sidewalks
are provided along all roadway segments. Within the shopping center, continuous pedestrian
facilities are provided that connect Jefferson Avenue to James Avenue. The signalized intersection
at Franklin Street and Jefferson Avenue provides crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and
ADA-compliant curb ramps along the north, south, and west legs. At the southeast corner of the
intersection, there exists signage and a physical barrier preventing pedestrians from crossing the
east leg of the intersection. The missing crosswalk on the east leg is not essential since the
crosswalk on the west leg is equally convenient. Otherwise, pedestrian connectivity to the transit
center along this route is also continuous.

Redwood City Caltrain Station

The shortest walking route to the Redwood City Caltrain Station from the project site is to walk east
along Diller Street or Wilson Street, turn left onto Franklin Street and then continue north through
the shopping center. The Caltrain station platform is located on the back side (east) of the shopping
center. There is a walkway through the shopping center that provides access to the southbound
train platform and a crosswalk across the Caltrain tracks that provides access to the northbound
train platform. This walkable distance is approximately 1,800 feet from the project site.

Recommended Improvements:
The project owner should coordinate with the City of Redwood City to stripe a crosswalk across the
west leg of Diller Street at its intersection with Franklin Street.
Bicycle Connectivity to Transit Facilities
Currently there are no bicycle facilities on any of the routes between the project site and the transit
facilities discussed above. However, the Redwood City General Plan, adopted on October 11, 2010
recommends bikeway improvements within the project study area. Improvements between the
project site and the transit facilities are listed below:
      Class II bike lanes or Class III bike routes are proposed on El Camino Real and James
       Avenue.
      Class II bike lanes are proposed on Jefferson Avenue west of Broadway.

Site Access Review
This section includes a review of site access in accordance with City standards and generally
accepted traffic engineering standards. This review is based on plans prepared by Studio T Square,
Inc. dated April 6, 2016. The site plan is shown on Figures 2 through 4. On-site circulation and
parking were not reviewed.
The project would have two driveways to and from the parking garage, one on Franklin Street and
one on the alley adjacent the southern edge of the project site that connects to El Camino Real.
The Downtown Precise Plan encourages access to parking facilities from alleyways whenever
possible. The alley is approximately 21 feet wide while the driveway on the alley would be
approximately 20 feet wide and would provide access to the underground parking level P1. The
driveway on Franklin Street would be 24 feet wide and provide access to underground parking
levels P2 and P3. The proposed driveway width is sufficient for two-way traffic and complies with
the parking standards set forth in the DPP. Circulation between underground parking level P1 and
the lower two garage levels (P2 and P3) would require vehicles to exit the garage and re-enter
again from the other driveway. There is a median on El Camino Real adjacent to the project site so

                                                                                              Page | 25
El Camino Real & Diller Residential Development – Traffic Study                             April 29, 2015


vehicles turning to and from the alley would be restricted to right turns in and right turns out.
However, there is no turning movement restriction at the project driveway on Franklin Street.

Currently, there are parallel parking stalls on the west side of Franklin Street in the vicinity of the
proposed project driveway. When occupied, these spaces could cause sight distance issues for
vehicles exiting this driveway. The project driveways should be free and clear of any obstructions to
optimize sight distance. Hexagon recommends that standard no parking zones be designated
adjacent to the project driveway on Franklin Street to ensure that exiting vehicles can see
pedestrians on the sidewalk, as well as vehicles on the road. No parking zones are marked
adjacent to the alley on El Camino Real. Any landscaping and signage should be located in such a
way to ensure an unobstructed view for drivers exiting the site. Currently, the project site has
three driveways on Diller Street and one on Franklin Street; however, the proposed project
would have only one driveway on Franklin Street and none on Diller Street. The elimination
of curb cuts along Diller Street will increase the amount of on-street parking. In addition, the
project proposes to provide angle parking along the Diller Street frontage, which will further
increase the on-street parking supply in the project vicinity.

Pedestrians will have access to the residential and commercial uses from several different
locations. Sidewalks are located along El Camino Real, Diller Street, Franklin Street and the alley.
The project will enhance pedestrian access to the site by adding bulb-outs and high visibility
crosswalks to all legs of the intersection of El Camino Real/Diller Street and Diller Street/Franklin
Street. The project proposes doors into the commercial area, residential lobby, mail rooms, and
lounge room from El Camino Real and from the parking garage level P1. The residential units along
the Diller Street and Franklin Street would have direct access. The residential lobby would be
accessible from Diller Street and Franklin Street would provide access to 2 elevators that go to all
levels. Pedestrian stairwells to the secured garage and upper levels of residential units are
proposed at three corners of the building. These stairwells would be accessible from the sidewalks
on Diller Street, Franklin Street and the alley. The project proposes a common bike storage room
on Level 1 that would be accessible from Diller Street. A second common bike storage room would
be provided on Level P1 of the underground garage.
The project plans show a designated loading area would be provided along the Diller Street for
moving/delivery trucks.

Conclusion
The purpose of the analysis is to confirm the results of the Redwood City Precise Plan Draft EIR,
identify any potential impacts on intersections in the project vicinity not previously evaluated, and
assess operational issues related to site access and internal circulation, parking, bike and
pedestrian facilities, and the possible removal of the right-turn lane on northbound El Camino Real
at Diller Street. Hexagon’s findings are summarized below.
      The estimated project trips fall within the projected volumes described in the Redwood City
       Downtown Precise Plan Draft EIR (DPP DEIR). Therefore, the project is not likely to create
       any new impacts to intersections previously evaluated in the DPP DEIR.

      The project would have insignificant impact at all study intersections not evaluated in the
       DPP DEIR.

      The removal of the existing right-turn lane on northbound El Camino Real at Diller Street
       and the addition of on-street parallel parking, as recommended by the City of Redwood City,
       would improve the pedestrian environment along El Camino Real. The modification is
                                                                                               Page | 26

       expected to have a negligible effect on traffic operations and safety since right-turn traffic
       volumes would continue to be extremely low even after nearby developments are built and
       fully occupied.
      There are adequate pedestrian connections between the project site and the nearby transit
       facilities with the exception of the intersection of Franklin Street and Diller Street.
      The project owner should coordinate with the City to stripe a crosswalk across the west leg
       of Diller Street at its intersection with Franklin Street.
      There are no bicycle facilities between the project site and the nearby transit facilities. The
       Redwood City General Plan, adopted on October 11, 2010 has identified bicycle facility
       improvements that would better connect the project site with the nearby transit facilities.
      No parking zones should be designated adjacent to the project driveway on Franklin Street
       to avoid any sight distance issues for vehicles using the Franklin Street driveway. There will
       not be a net loss in on-street parking due to the elimination of curb cuts and the proposed
       provision of angle parking along the project frontage on Diller Street.
      The project will enhance pedestrian access by building bulb-outs and high visibility
       crosswalks at the intersection of El Camino Real/Diller Street and Diller Street/Franklin
       Street
