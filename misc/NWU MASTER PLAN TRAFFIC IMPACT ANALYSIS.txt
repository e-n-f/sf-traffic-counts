Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
Northwest University Master Plan                                                                          June 2016



                                  Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Transportation Impact Analysis through a
set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

Where is the project located and what would be developed?
The focus of the Master Plan is the Northwest University main campus located at 5520 108th
Avenue NE in Kirkland, Washington. Key elements of the proposed Master Plan include the
addition of 4 new buildings, replacement of 3 existing buildings and associated
improvements, addition of parking, and public use of the sports fields. Four of the Master
Plan elements would address athletic program needs including replacement of the
gymnasium, new field house, new tennis center, and new fitness center.

The Campus Master Plan is anticipated to be implemented over a 20-year period between
2017 and 2037. Based on information provided by the University, over the next 6-years or by
2022, an increase of approximately 370 students is projected for the Kirkland campus 1
resulting in a total campus population of 1,600 students. In 20-years (2037), the campus
student population is anticipated to increase by approximately 770 students for a total of
approximately 2,000 students. The growth in student population reflects both on-campus
residents and commuters.

What existing public streets will serve the project and where is access proposed?
The Northwest University campus is located north of NE 53rd Street and east of 108th
Avenue NE. Two driveways including the main driveway are located along 108th Avenue NE
and 5 driveways are located along NE 53rd Street. The Master Plan would not change the
number of access points to the Campus.

Is the site currently served by public transit?
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit and Sound Transit.
The nearest bus stop to the campus is located along 108th Avenue NE approximately 250
feet north of the main driveway at NE 55th Lane. This bus stop is served by routes 255 and
540. An additional bus stop is provided at the NE 53rd Street intersection with 108th
Avenue NE, but only serves route 255.

How many new parking spaces are proposed and how many existing spaces would be
eliminated?

The master plan would construct between 370 and 470 additional parking spaces and
eliminate approximately 120 parking spaces. The net increase in campus parking would be
between 250 and 350 parking spaces. Specific, parking supply would be determined during
the building permit phase of the Master Plan and would take into consideration projected
parking demand based on enrollment and the specific building uses.
The existing parking supply could accommodate the anticipated future peak parking demand
with the Master Plan. With build-out of the Master Plan, parking utilization for the campus
would be approximately 90 percent if no new parking was constructed or 75 percent with an
additional 250 parking spaces. Provision of parking with the Master Plan would help distribute
the location of parking spaces within the campus as well as provide more conveniently
located parking for the proposed uses to help minimize off-campus parking.

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
Northwest University Master Plan                                                         June 2016


How many daily vehicular trips would the project generate and when would peak traffic
volumes occur?

Build-out of the Master Plan would generate 3,820 net new daily trips to and from the
campus. The peak volumes to and from the campus are expected to occur during the
weekday PM peak hour with the Master Plan resulting in approximately 460 net new PM peak
hour trips.

What Transportation impacts are anticipated, if any?
Intersection impacts are identified at the following locations:

              116th Avenue NE / NE 70th Place
              108th Avenue NE / NE 68th Street
              108th Avenue NE / NE 53rd Street

In addition, the Master Plan would result in the following neighborhood impacts:
              Contribution to Speeding Traffic along NE 53rd Street
              Increase Conflicts at 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street Intersection
              Increase in Neighborhood Cut-Through Traffic
              Potential for on-street parking within the neighborhood

What measures are proposed to reduce or control traffic impacts?
Potential mitigation measures include:

              Intersection Improvements
              Traffic Calming
              Parking / Internal Campus Connectivity
              Event Management

In addition, the University would be responsible for payment of City of Kirkland transportation
impact fees to mitigate general transportation related impacts of the Master Plan.

Intersection improvements could include contribution towards the 6th Street Corridor Study or
improvements identified as part of this study and installation of a traffic signal at the 108th
Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersection. It is anticipated that a traffic signal would be
warranted at this intersection with the first phase of the Master Plan.

The proposed traffic signal would help reduce neighborhood cut-through traffic by providing
better access via NE 53rd Street. In addition, the University could also contribute a
proportional share to traffic calming improvements along NE 53rd Street as well as within the
neighborhood. Depending on the traffic calming measures that are implemented such as
speed humps, speed cushions, curb extension, or other measures, vehicle speeds are likely
to be reduced.

Potential parking impacts to the neighborhood could be mitigated by:

              Providing additional internal pedestrian connections from parking lots to buildings
               and campus facilities.
              Assign campus population to specific parking lots to reduce potential parking in
               the neighborhood or moving vehicles between classes.



                                                                                                  iv

              Increase parking permit costs to deter student driving and potentially increase
               use of non-motorized and transit modes.

Lastly, an event management plan could be implemented to reduce on-campus congestion,
excess vehicle circulation by drivers unfamiliar with the campus and the potential for parking
within the neighborhood. Potential measures include:
              The assignment of specific event/visitor parking lots
              On-campus wayfinding signage directing drivers to specific parking areas (this is
               already done by the University during events)
              Active enforcement of any permanent and/or temporary parking restrictions
              Posting of no parking signage along NE 53rd Street during events and monitoring
               neighborhood parking

Northwest University Master Plan                                                                          June 2016



                                           Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential transportation-
related impacts to the surrounding roadway network associated with the proposed Northwest
University Master Plan. Mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce State
Environmental Policy Action (SEPA) impacts where required based on City of Kirkland
standards.

Northwest University is a regionally accredited, Christian institution awarding associate,
bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees. The main campus is located in Kirkland’s Central
Houghton neighborhood with satellite campuses in Kirkland north of the main campus, in
Sacramento, California, and Salem, Oregon. In addition, the University offers online
programs.

Northwest University also has an extensive sports program. The University is a member of
the Cascade Collegiate Conference and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
(NAIA). The athletics program currently includes soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball, cross
country, and track & field. Many of the existing athletic facilities are in need of upgrades
including the gymnasium, which are addressed through the master plan elements.

The focus of the master plan is the Northwest University main campus located at 5520 108th
Avenue NE. The main campus offers undergraduate, graduate, and adult evening classes.
The current enrollment is approximately 1,200 students with about 900 undergraduates and
300 graduate/adult evening class students. There are approximately 650 students living on-
campus. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the campus and its surrounding vicinity. As noted
above, due to the graduate class schedules and evening classes, not all students attend the
campus on a daily basis.


Proposed Master Plan Elements
Key elements of the proposed Master Plan include the addition of 4 new buildings,
replacement of 3 existing buildings and associated improvements, addition of parking, and
public use of the sports fields. Four of the Master Plan elements would address athletic
program needs including replacement of the gymnasium, new field house, new tennis center,
and new fitness center.

The Campus Master Plan is anticipated to be implemented over a 20-year period between
2017 and 2037. Based on information provided by the University and assuming growth
continues to occur consistent with the current campus trends, over the next 6-years or by
2022, an increase of approximately 370 students is projected for the Kirkland campus 2
resulting in a total campus enrollment of 1,600 students. In 20-years (2037), the campus
student population is anticipated to increase by approximately 770 students for a total of
approximately 2,000 students. This growth in student population reflects both on-campus
residents and commuters.

The completion of individual projects within the Master Plan would ultimately depend on
funding. The Master Plan includes 8 different phases. Descriptions of each phase, the
approximate gross floor area and timeline are summarized in Table 1.




2 The campus student population reflects the total headcount of students who attend classes on the Kirkland
campus. It does not include online students or students attending Northwest University at other campus locations.

rooms with approximately 300 beds. In addition, the Welcome Center would accommodate
banquet facilities for up to 500 guests.

The campus currently has 1,168 parking spaces and approximately 250 to 350 new parking
stalls would be added with buildout of the Master Plan. Most of the proposed parking would
be located under new buildings including the tennis center, gymnasium (Pavilion), and
Welcome Center. The actual amount of parking developed would be determined in
conjunction with construction permitting for individual phases so that the additional parking
supply that is constructed takes into consideration any refinements to the project description
and any changes to parking needs that may occur over time.

Vehicular access to the campus would be maintained at the existing locations and no new
access points are proposed. The 111th Avenue NE access would be realigned to the east to
accommodate the proposed tennis center. A campus site plan showing the existing and
proposed elements of the Master Plan are included on Figure 2.

Based on the City’s Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines (August 2014), the study
intersections are those that meet the minimum intersection proportional share impact criteria
or were identified by City staff. Appendix A contains the intersection proportional share
calculation worksheets. The off-site study intersections include:

     1. 6th Street S / Central Way
     2. 6th Street S / Kirkland Way
     3. 6th Street S / 9th Avenue S
     4. NE 70th Street / I-405 Ramps

     9. 132nd Avenue NE / NE 70th Place
     10. 108th Avenue NE / NE 53rd Street
In addition, the 7 NU site access driveways were studied including:

     A. 108th Avenue NE / Davis Driveway
     B. 108th Avenue NE / NE 55th Lane (Main Driveway)
     C. 110th Way / NE 53rd Street

     E. 111th Lane NE / NE 53rd Street
     F. Barton Driveway / NE 53rd Street
     G. 114th Avenue NE / NE 53rd Street

Consistent with the City TIA guidelines, the transportation analysis focuses on the weekday
AM and PM peak commute periods (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.). The
analysis summarized in the following sections describes existing (2016) conditions within the
project vicinity, forecast future without-project conditions, and future with-project conditions.
Future conditions were analyzed for a 2022 horizon year consistent with the City of Kirkland’s
six-year transportation concurrency horizon and 2037 conditions consistent with the
anticipated buildout of the Master Plan. Forecast impacts are identified by comparing without-
project impacts (i.e., assuming that student enrollment will remain equal to existing
conditions) to with the master plan impacts with increased campus enrollment and completion
of the proposed tennis center and public use of the campus sports fields.

Based on additional feedback from the City and community members, a neighborhood
focused transportation evaluation was also conducted. The analysis focused on campus-
related cut-through traffic north and south of the University and the transportation context and
impacts to NE 53rd Street adjacent to the campus.

Street System
The Northwest University campus is located north of NE 53rd Street and east of 108th
Avenue NE. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the major streets in the vicinity of the
campus. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 2, the site is surrounded by neighborhood
collectors with sidewalks and bicycle facilities provided in the immediate vicinity of the
campus.

     Street interchange.



Traffic Volumes
The City of Kirkland provided existing (2016) weekday PM peak traffic counts at several of
the off-site study intersections. Additional weekday PM peak turning movement counts were
conducted at the remaining study intersections and driveways in March and April 2016.
Weekday AM peak period traffic counts were also conducted at all study intersections and
driveways in March and April 2016. Existing weekday AM and PM peak commute hour traffic
volumes used for this analysis are summarized on Figure 3 with detailed traffic count data
provided in Appendix B.


Traffic Operations
Traffic operations at the off-site study intersections were evaluated and are characterized
through an intersection level of service (LOS) analysis. LOS is a widely applied analysis
technique for measuring the quality of traffic flow through intersections and comparing
resulting traffic operations to adopted standards.

LOS values range from LOS A indicating free-flow traffic to LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Existing delays and LOS values were calculated using
Highway Capacity Manual methods and the Synchro (version 9.1) software program.
Appendix C provides a more detailed explanation of intersection LOS. This method uses
peak hour traffic volumes, intersection geometry, intersection control, and roadway
characteristics as inputs to evaluate operations. All existing signal timing parameters were
provided by the City of Kirkland and Washington State Department of Transportation

Note: Shaded intersections operate below City of Kirkland or WSDOT LOS standards.
1. LOS as defined by the HCM (TRB, 2010)
2. Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3. Worst movement (WM) reported for stop-controlled intersections where WB = westbound approach and WBL = westbound left-
    turn movement.
4. Analyzed in HCM 2000 due to intersection configuration and signal phasing.


As highlighted in the above table, several existing intersections that operate below City and
WSDOT LOS standards under either weekday AM or PM peak hour conditions. These
include the 6th Street S/Central Way, 6th Street S/9th Avenue S, 108th Avenue NE/NE 68th
Street, 116th Avenue NE/I-405 Ramps, and 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersections.


Site Access & Neighborhood Context
The Northwest University Campus is bordered by 108th Avenue to the west and NE 53rd
Street to the south. The University currently has 7 driveways with 2 located along 108th
Avenue NE and 5 along NE 53rd Street. These driveways are identified as locations A
through G on Figure 4. The following sections summarize existing site access traffic volumes,
driveway operations, and traffic conditions in the neighborhood surrounding the campus.

Driveway Traffic Volumes
Weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the driveways were collected in March and
April 2016. Counts were collected over 3 different weekdays in support of forecasting the
campus vehicular trip generation that is described in the future with-project section. To
provide a conservative analysis, the date when the highest overall campus traffic volumes
were observed during the 3 days4 of collection was selected for evaluating site access traffic
operations. Existing weekday AM and PM peak hour volumes used for this analysis are
summarized on Figure 4. Note that the 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersection is also
shown since this is a primary access intersection to the 5 campus driveways along NE 53rd
Street.

3 The study area is within a Tier 1 inner urban areas, which is defined as a 3-mile buffer around the most heavily
traveled freeways (e.g., I-405) and all designated urban areas. The LOS standard for Tier 1 routes is LOS
E/Mitigated meaning that congestion should be mitigated when the weekday PM peak hour LOS falls below E. Level
of Service Standards for Washington State Highways. January 1, 2010.
4The highest combined weekday AM and PM peak hour campus generated traffic occurred on Wednesday April 13,
2016.

Driveway Traffic Operations
Driveway traffic operations were evaluated based on the HCM 2010 methodologies using the
Synchro 9.1 software program consistent with the analysis of off-site study intersections.
Weekday AM and PM peak hour site access operations are summarized in Table 4.

Note: Shaded intersections operate below City of Kirkland LOS standards.
1. LOS as defined by the HCM (TRB, 2010)
2. Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3. Worst movement (WM) reported for stop-controlled intersections where SBL = southbound left-turn movement, WB = westbound
    approach, NB = northbound approach, SB = southbound approach, and WBL = westbound left-turn movement.


As shown in Table 4, all existing campus driveways currently operate at LOS C or better
during both weekday peak hours. As shown previously in Table 3, the westbound left-turn
lane on NE 53rd Street at 108th Avenue NE currently operates at LOS F during the weekday
AM and PM peak hours.

Neighborhood Traffic Conditions
Existing traffic conditions in the neighborhood surrounding the campus were reviewed.
Specifically, the review included a vehicle speed study along NE 53rd Street, neighborhood
cut-through traffic study, and school activity in the vicinity of the NE 53rd Street/108th
Avenue NE intersection.

NE 53rd Street Speed Study
Vehicle speeds along NE 53rd Street near the intersection with 111th Avenue NE were
measured using a pneumatic tube traffic counter over a 7-day period in April/May 2016.5 The
observed vehicle speeds were then reviewed to identify the median and 85th-percentile
speeds to assess whether vehicle speeds are notably greater than the posted speed limit.
The posted speed limit along this corridor is 25 mph.

The median speed value is the speed at which 50 percent of all traffic is traveling at or below,
and is also known as the 50th-percential speed. This statistical measure is typically used as a
point of reference in understanding the prevailing conditions. The median speeds along a
corridor should typically be under the posted speed limit. The 85th percentile speed is often
used as a starting point for determining whether a speeding issue is present, and takes into
account that 15 percent of drivers may be traveling much faster or slower than the posted
speed. Typically, the 85th percentile speed should be approximately 5 mph over or under the
posted speed limit.

The median and 85th-percential speed results of the speed study are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5.        NE 53rd Street Speed Study Summary – East of 111th Avenue NE
Direction                              Speed Limit       Median Speed      85th Percentile Speed
Eastbound NE 53rd Street                 25 mph            28.0 mph              32.5 mph
Westbound NE 53rd Street                 25 mph            27.3 mph              31.8 mph


As shown, the median speed for both directions is approximately 28 miles per hour, while the
85th percentile speed is approximately 32 miles per hour. The MUTCD generally suggests
that the 85th percentile speed be within 5 mph of the posted speed limit. The results show
that the 85th percentile speed is approximately 7 mph above the posted speed limit indicating
excessive speeds along this section of NE 53rd Street.

Neighborhood Cut-Through Traffic
With existing congestion and queuing along 108th Avenue NE during weekday AM and PM
peak hours, some drivers may choose to use neighborhood streets to avoid this congestion.
Based on the neighborhood roadway network east of 108th Avenue NE and south of NE 68th
Street, coordination with City staff, and feedback from the neighborhood, two cut-through
routes were identified for further review including:

               North Cut-Through Route – NE 60th Street to 111th Avenue NE, then to
                NE 65th Street and NE 68th Street further north
               South Cut-Through Route – 111th Avenue NE to NE 48th Street to 108th
                Avenue NE

To assess how much of this cut-through traffic is related to the campus, automatic license
plate recognition (ALPR) technology was used to conduct this study. Cameras were placed
along the NE 48th Street and NE 65th Street as well at the three highest volume campus
driveways and license plates were matched to identify the number of campus drivers using
either of the neighborhood cut-through routes. The number of observed cut-through vehicles
related to the campus are summarized in Table 6.

Outbound from Campus                                      0 vehicles            0 vehicles


As shown in Table 6, the observations indicate that neighborhood cut-through traffic
specifically related to the campus is relatively minimal. There were fewer than ten vehicles
per hour observed traveling between the campus and neighborhood routes to and from the
north via 110th Avenue NE during the weekday peak hours. For routes through the
neighborhood south of campus, no cut-through traffic was observed during the weekday AM
peak hour and only 1 vehicle was observed during the weekday PM peak hour travelling
to/from the campus. Based on traffic counts with the neighborhoods, campus related cut-
through traffic was observed to be approximately 3 percent or less during the weekday peak
hours. In general, these observations show no notable campus traffic volumes that travel
these cut-through routes during peak conditions.

108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street School Activity
Several school-related facilities exist in the vicinity of the 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street
intersection including:

              Lake Washington School District’s Emerson K-12 school on the southeast corner
              Puget Sound Adventist Academy private school on the northeast corner
              Kirkland Children’s School day care, preschool and kindergarten classes just
               north of NE 53rd Street on the west side of 108th Avenue NE

The travel activity for these 3 uses generally peak at similar times of day and include walking,
passenger car drop-off/pick-up, transit, and school bus activities. The peak periods for activity
for these 3 sites typically fall within the morning commute periods when children arrive at
these facilities and again in the mid- to late- afternoon hour when they depart. Activities near
the 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersection that influence transportation conditions at
this location include:

              Northbound and southbound 108th Avenue NE bus stops with shelters for King
               County Metro
              A mid-block crosswalk with overhead flashing warning lights across 108th
               Avenue NE between the east and west legs of NE 53rd Street
              Observed school bus loading northbound and southbound on 108th Avenue NE
               immediately south of both east and west legs of 53rd Avenue NE

Activity at this intersection was observed during both the morning peak (approximately 7:30
to 9:00 a.m.) and mid-afternoon peak periods (approximately 2:00 to 4:00 p.m.). The
observations noted various short-term congestion and blockages associated with school-
related travel. This includes:

              Northbound Metro buses stopping at NE 53rd Street to load/unload
              Westbound NE 53rd Street queues forming from yielding to both 108th
               Avenue NE vehicle traffic and pedestrians using the mid-block crosswalk
              On-site queuing at the Kirkland Children’s School extending onto 108th
               Avenue NE
              School buses stopping on 108th Avenue NE

Parking
The existing parking supply was inventoried and on-campus parking utilization was observed
in March 2016. The existing campus contains 1,168 parking spaces designated for campus
use. Parking utilization counts were conducted hourly between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. during a
midweek day when school was in session. This time period represents when Northwest
University class attendance is typically greatest. The observed peak campus parking
utilization occurred between 10 and 11 a.m. with a total of 638 vehicles parked on campus or
approximately 55 percent of the campus parking spaces occupied. Figure 5 summarizes the
campus parking utilization during the peak period by lot. As shown on the figure, most of the
parking lots are less than 85 percent utilized.




                                                                                                12

                     Figure 5.         Peak Campus Parking Utilization (10 – 11 a.m.)

The campus neighbors have identified potential on-street parking issues. To understand, the
level of campus-related on-street parking occurring within the neighborhood on weekdays
that street parking was inventoried. Parking data was collected between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on
two weekdays: (1) when the University was in-session and (2) during the University spring
break. Comparing these two days provides an understanding of on-street parking
characteristics was found that in the study area, parking demand was actually higher when
school was not in session compared to a school session count which implies an insignificant
on-street parking impact. When analyzing only the streets immediately adjacent to the
campus along 114th Avenue, NE 50th Street, NE 53rd Street, and NE 59th Street, the
parking demand was approximately 5% higher (~1-2 vehicles) during the school session
counts, which also implies an insignificant impact.


Traffic Safety
The collision history within the study area was reviewed to identify any locations where
adverse safety conditions may exist. Collision data provided by WSDOT for the most recent
three-year period (January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015) was reviewed. Table 7
summarizes the number of collisions at each of the study intersections.

1.   The number of collisions per Million Entering Vehicles (MEV) assuming weekday PM peak hour traffic is approximately
     10 percent of daily traffic.


A review of the traffic safety within the study area was completed by compiling crash rates
(i.e., collisions per million entering vehicles) by study intersection to identify locations with
potential safety issues. Based on the methodology found in Chapter 4 of the Highway Safety
Manual (AASHTO, 2010), observed and critical crash rates at each study intersection were
compared to identity where observed rates were higher than the calculated critical rate. The
study intersections were grouped into three categories for calculating critical crash rates: (1)
traffic signals, (2) side-street stop-control, and (3) all-way stop-control intersections. As
shown in the table, the 116th Avenue NE / NE 70th Street intersection was the only
intersection where the observed crash rate was greater than the critical crash rate.

Of the 27 total collisions that occurred at this location during the three-year period, however
only 4 of the collisions occurred in 2015. The most common types were left-turn related (15),
followed by rear-end (7), and angled (2). Of the 15 left-turn related collisions, 13 involved the
westbound left turn movement. The left-turn signal phasing for this movement is currently
protected/permitted. Over the last year collisions at this location have decreased with a total
of 4 collisions and only 1 left-turn related collision in 2015. The City regularly monitors traffic
safety to understand patterns and the need for safety improvements. Given that collisions,
have recently decreased at this location no collision pattern is noted. This intersection would
continue to be monitored by the City and if necessary safety improvements such as protected
left-turn phasing could be implemented.

None of the reported collisions at this location involved a serious injury or a fatality. There
were no pedestrian-related or bicyclist-related collisions that were reported within the study
area during this period.

Non-Motorized Facilities
Separated pedestrian facilities are provided throughout the study area. Sidewalks are
provided on both 108th Avenue NE and NE 53rd Street within the immediate site vicinity of
the campus. Further north of the site, NE 68th Street and 6th Street S also provide sidewalks
on both sides of the street. A mid-block crosswalk with an overhead flashing warning lights is
provided across 108th Avenue NE between the east and west legs of NE 53rd Street. Marked
crosswalks are also provided across NE 53rd Street and 55th Lane NE (the main campus
driveway) at 108th Avenue NE.

Separate bicycle lanes are provided along the majority of 108th Avenue NE with shared lanes
along some portions where right-of-way is limited. North of NE 68th Street, 6th Street S
provides dedicated bicycle lanes on both sides of the street. East of 108th Avenue NE, NE
68th Street also provides bicycle lanes on both sides of the street.


Transit Service
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit and Sound Transit.
The nearest bus stop to the campus is located along 108th Avenue NE approximately 250
feet north of the main driveway at NE 55th Lane. This bus stop is served by routes 255 and
540. An additional bus stop is provided at the NE 53rd Street intersection with 108th
Avenue NE, but only serves route 255.

Route 255 provides service from the Brickyard Park-and-Ride to Kirkland Transit Center to
Downtown Seattle running 7 days a week. Service is provided on weekdays from
approximately 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. with 15-minute headways during the weekday PM peak hour.
Weekend service is also provided from approximately 6 a.m. to midnight with 30-minute peak
headways.

Route 540 travels between the University District and Kirkland running weekdays only.
Service is provided from approximately 7 a.m. to 7:20 p.m. with 15-minute headways during
the weekday PM peak hour.

                Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes future without-project conditions within the identified study area.
Future conditions were analyzed for a 2022 horizon year consistent with the City of Kirkland’s
six-year transportation concurrency horizon and 2037 conditions consistent with the
anticipated buildout of the Master Plan. The following sections summarize the planned
changes to the street system, future forecasted traffic volumes, traffic operations, site access
and the neighborhood context.

Street System
The adopted Kirkland 2015-2020 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and current project
website were reviewed to identify funded transportation improvements in the study area that
would be completed by 2022 or 2037. In addition, the City of Kirkland’s adopted
Transportation Master Plan, November 2015, City of Kirkland 2015 Comprehensive Plan
Update & Totem Lake Planned Action – Final Environmental Impact Statement, November
2015 and City of Kirkland 2015 Comprehensive Plan Update & Totem Lake Planned Action –
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), June 2015 were also reviewed to understand
potential long-range improvements that could impact 2037 conditions in the study area.

Planned funded improvements are along 6th Street in the study area at intersections with 9th
Street S, Kirkland Way, and Central Way. The 6th Street S intersections at 9th Street and
Kirkland Way are expected to be signalized by the end of 2016. Phase 2 improvements to the
6th Street S/Central Way intersection are planned for construction in 2017. The intersection
improvements include a second westbound left-turn lane, a bicycle lane, and pedestrian
improvements. These improvements were reflected in the evaluation of future 2022 and 2037
traffic operations.

In addition to these specific improvements described above, the CIP also includes funding for
the 6th Street South Corridor Study, which will also include the 6th Street Corridor Study and
Houghton/Everest Neighborhood Center Plan. The City has hired a consultant for this work
and is in the process of scoping the study. This study will develop a corridor and
neighborhood plan including transportation solutions to accommodate growth in the study
area. These solutions may include policies (e.g., parking policies), projects (e.g., intersection
improvements) and programs (e.g., bikeshare). Given constraints along the corridor project
will generally focus on transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities and consider safety,
geometrics, and other transportation conditions along the corridor.

The Transportation Master Plan identifies, as part of this long-range plan, that the City should
engage with WSDOT to discuss improvements of the existing interchanges including at NE
70th Street. In addition, the 2015 Comprehensive Plan Update DEIS notes a potential
improvement to the 116th Avenue NE/NE 70th Street (NE 72nd Place) intersection to provide
a dedicated southbound right-turn pocket.

Traffic Volumes
Future (2022) weekday traffic volumes were forecast based on information provided by the
City of Kirkland. City staff provided the 2022 weekday PM peak hour volumes at eight of the
ten study intersections based on the City’s travel demand model. Forecast at the 2 remaining
off-site study intersections6 were developed by applying a 2 percent per year growth rate to
existing traffic volumes and adjusting results to account for balancing along the 6th Street,
NE 68th Street, and 108th Avenue NE corridors to forecasts 2022 conditions. The City’s

66th Street/9th Avenue S and 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street forecasts were developed based on a 2 percent per
year growth rate.



                                                                                                          16

travel demand model does not include weekday AM peak hour forecasts. Future weekday
AM peak hour traffic volumes were determined by applying a growth rate to the existing AM
peak hour volumes. The growth rate was determined based on the weekday PM peak hour
forecasts from the City’s travel demand model. Forecast (2022) without-project weekday AM
and PM peak hour traffic volumes are summarized on Figure 6.

Future 2037 traffic volumes were forecast based on growth rate of 1.3 percent per year
estimated by comparing existing 2016 traffic counts and 2035 traffic forecast from the City’s
adopted Transportation Master Plan, 2015. This growth rate was then applied to the 2022
traffic volume forecasts to forecast 2037 weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes.
Forecast (2037) weekday AM and PM peak hour off-site study intersection traffic volumes are
summarized on Figure 7.

Traffic Operations
Traffic operations were evaluated for the forecast 2022 and 2037 without-project conditions
using the LOS method described previously for existing conditions. All existing signal timing
settings remained unchanged from existing conditions with the exception of the 6th Street
intersections where the City has planned improvements. With completion of the planned
second westbound-left lane at 6th Street/Central Way, traffic signal timing settings were

As shown in Table 8, with future planned improvements by 2022, LOS at 2 of the study
intersections along 6th Street would improve compared to existing conditions during the
weekday AM and PM peak hour.

In addition, in 2022 without the Master Plan, traffic operations are anticipated to worsen at 4
study intersections during the weekday AM peak hour and 5 study intersections during the
weekday PM peak hour compared to existing conditions. The following off-site study
intersections would operate below their applicable LOS standard under forecast 2022
conditions:
               NE 70th Street / I-405 Ramps
               116th Avenue NE / NE 70th Place

Notes: Shaded intersections operate below City of Kirkland LOS D or WSDOT Mitigated LOS E standards.
1. LOS as defined by the HCM (TRB, 2010)
2. Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3. Worst movement (WM) reported for stop-controlled intersections where WB = westbound approach and WBL = westbound left-
    turn movement.
4. Analyzed in HCM 2000 due to intersection configuration and signal phasing.


As shown in Table 9, eight of the ten off-site study intersections are forecast to operate below
their applicable LOS standard under either weekday AM or PM peak hour conditions with
long-term growth projected by 2037. The results of the 2037 analysis are consistent with the
City’s Transportation Master Plan, which identified congestion and poor intersections
operations with anticipated growth levels along key corridors including 6th Street, Central
Way, and the area of the NE 70th Street interchange.


Site Access & Neighborhood Context
The following sections summarize forecast site access traffic volumes, driveway operations,
and traffic conditions in the neighborhood surrounding the campus.

Driveway Traffic Volumes
As described in the analysis scope description, future without-project traffic conditions were
assumed to include no growth in on-campus student enrollment. The impacts of future
student growth, facilitated by the proposed expansion of the campus infrastructure is

documented in the Project Impact section of this study. Based on this no growth assumption,
traffic volumes travelling to and from the campus were assumed to remain unchanged from
existing conditions and background traffic volumes on NE 53rd Street and 108th Avenue NE
were assumed to increase as previously described for the off-site study intersections.

Forecast weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the site access driveways based
on these assumptions are summarized on Figure 8 for 2022 conditions and Figure 9 for 2037
conditions.

Driveway Traffic Operations
Traffic operations under forecast future traffic volumes were evaluated consistent with the
methodology previously described. Table 10 summarizes the 2022 forecast without-project
AM and PM peak hour intersection operations for the campus driveways and Table 11
summarizes 2037 forecast operations.

growth, the 108th Avenue NE/55th Lane NE intersection is forecasted to operate at LOS E on
the eastbound campus driveway approach during the weekday PM peak hour. In addition, as
noted in the previous section, the 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersection, which
provides access to the campus driveways along NE 53rd Street, would operate at LOS F
during both the AM and PM peak hours under 2022 and 2037 conditions.

Neighborhood Traffic Conditions
Transportation-related conditions within the neighborhood immediately surrounding the
campus are likely to remain similar to existing conditions under 2022 and 2037 without-
project conditions. While some redevelopment is possible, the surrounding neighborhood is
expected to generally remain single-family homes and no specific changes to the locations or
operations of the schools located near the 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersection are
anticipated. As a result, the speeds, cut-through, and school conditions are likely to be similar
to those identified previously in the existing neighborhood context section.


Non-Motorized Facilities
The City of Kirkland’s Transportation Master Plan recommends pedestrian and bicycle facility
improvements throughout the City to improve connectivity, access, and safety. As discussed
previously, these improvements are generally unfunded but are part of the City’s
Transportation Master Plan recommendations in the immediate vicinity of the University. This
includes creating a greenway along NE 52nd Street, NE 53rd Street and 114th Avenue NE to
facilitate bicycle access. This greenway would connect to the Cross Kirkland Corridor (major
north-south separated non-motorized corridor that crosses the City) at NE 52nd Street and
connect to the recommended NE 60th Street greenway via 114th Avenue NE.

                                       Project Impacts
This section documents project-generated impacts on the transportation system in the vicinity
of the Northwest University campus associated with the proposed Master Plan. First,
weekday commute peak hour vehicular traffic generation is estimated for the forecast
campus enrollment growth, tennis center, and public use of the sports fields, and is then
distributed and assigned to the study area. Next, future traffic volumes with the Master Plan
are determined and potential traffic volume and operations impacts are identified. Lastly,
potential impacts to the neighborhood, parking, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities and
transit are addressed.

Trip Generation
The anticipated growth in vehicle trip travel to and from the campus are generally associated
with the on-campus student population. No individual development phase is anticipated to
directly result in increased campus student enrollment; however, Northwest University does
anticipate enrollment growth over the Master Planning analysis period and the additional
buildings are intended to serve the general growth in campus population. Approximately
1,200 students attended classes on the Northwest University campus. This student
enrollment includes undergraduate/graduate students living on-campus, undergraduate/
graduate commuters, and adult evening class students. The enrollment does not include
students enrolled in online classes or at other Northwest University campuses since these do
not generate traffic or parking associated with the Kirkland main campus.

Based on information provided by Northwest University, over the next 6-years or by 2022, an
increase of approximately 370 students is projected for the Kirkland campus 7 resulting in a
total campus population of 1,600 students. In 20-years (2037), the campus student
population is anticipated to increase by approximately 770 students for a total of
approximately 2,000 students. The growth in student population reflects both on-campus
residents and commuters. The proposed residence hall would increase the proportion of
students living on-campus in the next 6-years by approximately 5 percent, which could result
in a decrease in the trip generation rate associated with the campus. As a conservative
estimate of potential traffic associated with the campus, the analysis assumes trip generation
rates would remain consistent with current conditions.

In addition to increases in campus student population over the analysis period, the Master
Plan includes some public uses of the proposed tennis center and sports fields as well as the
proposed banquet facility within the Welcome Center. The public use of the tennis center and
sports fields would likely generate traffic on a regular basis during the weekday periods while
the banquet facility use would be intermittent. With intermittent use of the banquet facilities,
this is not included as part of the typical weekday traffic projections; however, it has been
evaluated independently to confirm adequate parking would exist for an event. The following
sections describe the method used to forecast vehicle trips for increases in campus student
enrollment, and public use of the tennis center and sports fields.

Campus Trip Generation
The trip generation rates used to forecast the additional vehicle trips generated by increased
Northwest University campus enrollment were determined based on traffic counts conducted
at the existing campus driveways. Vehicular turning movement counts at the existing
Northwest University access driveways were collected during weekday AM (7-9 a.m.) and PM
(4-6 p.m.) peak periods on three separate days. Appendix E provides a summary of the

campus-wide trip generation during weekday AM and PM peak hour and detailed count
worksheets for the three days at each driveway location. The data showed trip generation
varied from day-to-day; therefore, as a conservative estimate of trip generation, the existing
trip generation rate was based on the highest AM and PM peak hour traffic volume observed.

Weekday daily vehicular trip generation was estimated based on data provided by automated
vehicle counters placed at the two highest volume campus driveways over a seven-day
period. Detailed count worksheets are also provided in Appendix E. Weekday daily and peak
hour traffic volumes from the automated counters were used to identify factors that were
applied to the weekday AM and PM peak hour vehicular trip generation rates to estimate a
daily trip generation rate. Factoring the AM peak hour trip rate provides the greatest estimate
weekday daily vehicular trip rate.8

Table 12 provides a summary of the weekday daily and peak hour trip generation rates, and
also summarizes the inbound distribution.

Compared to national data sets for colleges/universities trip rates published in the Institute of
Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition), the observed rates are
higher. The ITE trip rates are 0.17 vehicle trips per student during both the weekday AM or
PM peak hours and 1.71 trips per student each weekday. Table 13 summarizes the forecast
new vehicle trip generation for the increase on-campus student enrollment.

Tennis Center Trip Generation
The proposed on-campus tennis center would be available to Northwest University as well as
accommodate uses that are currently occurring at the Eastside Tennis Center. Use of the
tennis center by on-campus University students and staff would not generate additional off-
site trips as their trips were assumed to originate on-campus.

The Eastside Tennis Center is located at 10822 117th Place NE. Vehicle counts were
collected at the current facility’s doorway entrance on three weekdays during the weekday
PM commute peak period. Detailed count data is provided in Appendix E. The observations

8Weekday AM peak hour volumes are 5.4 percent of daily volumes at the two highest volume campus
driveways while PM peak hour volumes are 9.0 percent of daily volumes.

Northwest University Master Plan                                                              June 2016


showed an average 43 weekday PM peak hour vehicular trips with 23 inbound and 20
outbound vehicles. The existing tennis center has 12 courts resulting in a vehicle trip rate of
3.59 trips per court with a distribution of 58 percent inbound trips. This vehicular trip
generation is greater than published in Trip Generation for the Racket/Tennis Club land use
(LU #491)9. The proposal would reduce the number of courts to 6 resulting in 22 weekday PM
peak hour vehicle trips (12 inbound, 10 outbound).

Eastside Tennis Center classes currently operate at capacity during weekday PM peak
period and below capacity during weekday AM peak period. To provide a conservative
forecast of potential tennis center traffic, weekday AM peak hour tennis center trips were
assumed to be equal to PM peak hour trips. However, a 50 percent inbound trip distribution
consistent with Trip Generation information for a fitness center (LU #492), a similar type of
use, was assumed since directional trip information is not available for the Trip Generation
tennis/racket club land use (LU #491).

Weekday daily trips were estimated by factoring the observed PM trips using trip generation
rates for Racket/Tennis Club published in Trip Generation.10 This results in approximately
250 weekday daily vehicle trips. Tennis center trip generation for these time periods is
summarized in Table 14.

Public Sports Field Use Trip Generation
Public use of the sports fields could include a variety of organizations to support community
sports. Northwest University would have first priority for field use; therefore, public field use
would generally occur in the evenings or on weekends. The sports fields would be configured
to accommodate a variety of team sports including baseball, softball, soccer, and lacrosse.
Based on a review of the potential sports that may use the field, youth soccer (under 8 years
old) is likely to be the worst-case weekday peak trip generator and has been used to estimate
potential weekday PM peak hour vehicular trip generation for public use of the sports fields.11
Public use of the sports fields would typically occur after 5 p.m. In total, 128 children and 32
coaches could be on-site during practice. This assumes up to 16 teams could practice
concurrently. Assuming approximately 25 percent of parent drop-off their children and the
remaining stay to watch the practice, this results in an estimated 160 inbound and 32
outbound vehicle trips, or 192 total weekday PM peak hour vehicle trips.

Weekday daily trips associated with the youth soccer accounts for parents returning to pick-
up their children and assumes only one youth soccer session during the weekday. Forecast
weekday PM peak hour and daily vehicular trip generation associated with public use of the
Northwest University ball fields is summarized in Table 15. Since public use of the sports
fields during mid-week periods would only occur during evening time periods, no AM peak
hour trips would occur.




9 LU #491 – 3.35 vehicles per tennis court during the weekday PM peak hour of the adjacent street.
10 Weekday daily vehicle trips for LU #491 = 38.70 per tennis court.
11 Based on the field size, up to 16 teams could practice at one time with 8 players per team and 2

coaches per team.

As summarized in the table, the campus master plan is estimated to generate 2,130 daily
trips, 107 AM peak hour trips, and 332 PM peak hour trips in 2022. In year 2037, the master
plan is estimated to generate 3,820 daily trips, 199 AM peak hour trips, and 480 PM peak
hour trips.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The distribution of project traffic was based on a combination of information provided by the
City of Kirkland, existing travel patterns at the study intersections, and analysis of the off-
campus students’ zip codes. Figure 10 and Figure 11 summarizes the distribution pattern for
all proposed land uses and analysis years 2022 and 2037 respectively.

Northwest University Master Plan                                                       June 2016


As shown, approximately 30 percent of the on-campus student enrollment generated traffic
was forecast to/from the south on 108th Avenue NE, 10 percent to/from the east on NE 70th
Street east of I-405, 40 percent northbound on I-405, and the remaining 20 percent to/from
the north on State Street and 6th Street S. When assigning trips to the campus driveways,
future school generated trips were assumed to distribute proportionally based on the existing
driveway distribution.

The tennis center trips were assigned exclusively to the 110th Way NE driveway due to
location of the proposed tennis center and parking garage. Lastly, trips generated by public
use of the ball fields were assigned exclusively to the 111th Lane NE driveway due to its
proximity to the sports fields and large parking lots. Master Plan-related vehicle trips were
added to the future 2022 and 2037 without-project traffic volumes to form the basis of the
with-project analysis. Figure 12 shows the 2022 forecast with-project weekday AM and PM
peak hour traffic volumes at the off-site study intersections and 2037 with-project traffic
volumes are shown in Figure 13.

Future With-Project Traffic Operations
An operational analysis was conducted at the study intersections to evaluate the future
(2022) weekday AM and PM peak hour conditions with the project. The results of the with-
project analysis were compared to the without-project conditions to identify the potential
project impacts. Table 17summarizes the future with and without-project LOS for the forecast
2022 weekday AM and PM peak hour. Table 18 summarizes the LOS results for 2037 without
and with-project conditions. Detailed LOS worksheets are included in Appendix D. The
shaded intersections are those operating below the current LOS standard.

2. Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3. Worst movement (WM) reported for stop-controlled intersections where WB = westbound approach and WBL = westbound left-

4. Analyzed in HCM 2000 due to intersection configuration and signal phasing.


As discussed previously, the City adopted standard is LOS D and WSDOT’s is LOS E
mitigated with the study area. As shown in Table 17and Table 18, for both 2037 and 2022
conditions the proposed Master Plan is not anticipated to degrade the study intersections to a
worse LOS during the weekday AM or PM peak hours as compared to without-project
conditions. There are several locations that would continue to operate below the adopted
LOS standard under either the 2022 and/or 2037 conditions during the weekday AM and PM
peak hours.

Based on the City’s Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines (August 2014), the City defines a
SEPA impact requiring mitigation at a signalized location where the project’s proportional
share of daily intersection traffic related to the capacity of the intersection represents the
following:12
           More than 15 percent at intersections operating at LOS E
           More than 5 percent at intersections operating at LOS F

Appendix A contains the proportional share calculation worksheets for each intersection
under 2022 and 2037 conditions. Table 19 summarizes the proportionate share at each off-
site study intersection.

1.   City of Kirkland proportionate share calculation methodology. Proportional share is calculated based on the current enrollment
     projections and potential phasing of the Master Plan. The Master Plan will be phased over a 20-year period.


Based on the adopted LOS standards, forecast traffic operations, and the proportionate share
calculations, mitigation would be required to address project impacts at three City of Kirkland
study intersections under either 2022 or 2037 conditions:
                116th Avenue NE / NE 70th Place
                108th Avenue NE / NE 68th Street
                108th Avenue NE / NE 53rd Street
For WSDOT locations, based on the Development Services Manual, April 2016 when a
development affects a highway intersection where LOS is already below the applicable
threshold, then the pre-development LOS is the condition that is preserved. WSDOT also
notes that mitigation must be reasonably related and proportional to the development’s
impacts. As described in the future without-project section, LOS F conditions at the NE 70th
Street/116th Avenue NE/I-405 ramps were previously identified in the City’s 2015
Transportation Master Plan. No specific improvements have been identified at this location
but the City recognizes the need to coordinate with WSDOT on improvements at this
interchange.

Mitigation measures to address intersection impacts of the Master Plan are summarized in
Mitigation and Recommendations section of this study.

Site Access & Neighborhood Context
The following sections summarize future site access traffic volumes, driveway operations,
and traffic conditions in the neighborhood surrounding the campus.

Driveway Traffic Volumes
Forecast 2022 and 2037 site access driveway traffic volumes were forecast consistent with
the previously described methodologies. The assignment of future project trips to the campus
driveways assumed a distribution based on the existing driveway travel patterns and the
location of future Master Plan uses. The tennis center trips were assigned exclusively to the
110th Way NE driveway and trips generated by public use of the sports fields were assigned
exclusively to the 111th Lane NE driveway. Master Plan-related vehicle trips were then added
to the future 2022 and 2037 without-project traffic volumes to form the basis of the with-
project analysis. Figure 14 shows the 2022 forecast with-project weekday AM and PM peak
hour traffic volumes at the campus driveways and 2037 traffic volumes are shown on Figure
15.

Driveway Traffic Operations
Traffic operations under forecast future with-project traffic volumes were evaluated consistent
with the methodology previously described for existing and future without-project conditions.
Table 20 summarizes the 2022 forecast without-project AM and PM peak hour intersection
operations for the campus driveways and Table 21 summarizes 2037 forecast operations.

As shown in Table 20, all site access driveways are forecasted to operate at LOS D or better
in both peak hours under 2022 with the forecast on-campus student enrollment growth. With
additional background traffic growth and the Master Plan and enrollment growth by 2037, as
shown in Table 21, the 108th Avenue NE/55th Lane NE intersection is forecasted to operate
at LOS F during the weekday PM peak hour. In addition, as discussed previously, the 108th
Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street intersection, which provides access to the campus driveways
along NE 53rd Street, would operate at LOS F. Improvements to address potential operations

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
Northwest University Master Plan                                                        June 2016


Driveway Configuration and Spacing
As discussed previously, the Master Plan does not propose any new driveways; however, it
does propose to realign the 111th Avenue NE driveway to accommodate the proposed tennis
center. The City of Kirkland’s Policy R-4: Driveway Policy, April 2016 outlines the standards
for driveway configuration and spacing. The proposed driveway improvements were reviewed
against this policy.

The proposed realignment would create an offset intersection by moving 111th Avenue NE to
the east or right of the existing driveway south of NE 53rd Street. Based on City Policy R-4,
the City prefers new driveways be aligned with existing opposing driveways or be offset to the
left of the existing opposing driveway in order to minimize left turn conflicts on the streets.
The current proposed realignment of the 111th Avenue NE driveway would result in new left-
turn conflicts with the existing opposing southern leg of 111th Avenue NE. In order to
minimize these conflicts, consistent with the City’s Policy R-4, it is recommended that left-
turns be restricted to and from the Northwest University 111th Avenue NE access.

The proposed driveway realignment would meet the City of Kirkland driveway spacing
requirements. The City requires a driveway spacing of 50-feet along collectors, such as NE
53rd Street, for non-residential use.

Neighborhood Traffic Conditions
The Master Plan and growth in student enrollment would result in additional traffic to and
from the campus. Resulting project neighborhood impacts would include:
         Contribution to Speeding Traffic along NE 53rd Street. As noted in existing
          conditions, there are speeding issues along NE 53rd Street and with the additional
          traffic due to the Master Plan the number of vehicles travelling above the posted
          speed limit would likely increase.
         Increase Conflicts at 108th Avenue NE/NE 53rd Street Intersection. As traffic
          volumes increase, the number of conflicts between various modes would increase.
          This would include an increase in conflicts with the school-related activity already
          occurring at this intersection.
         Increase in Neighborhood Cut-Through Traffic. The review of existing
          neighborhood cut-through traffic to and from the campus showed very few vehicles
          related to Northwest University travelled within the neighborhood. With increases in
          traffic volumes and congestion in the study area, there could be some increase in
          neighborhood cut-through traffic including for vehicles associated with the campus.

Mitigations to address these neighborhood impacts are discussed in the Mitigation and
Recommendations section.

Parking
This section summarizes the anticipated Master Plan parking supply and demand.

Supply
The proposed Master Plan could accommodate between 250 and 350 parking stalls. Specific,
parking supply would be determined during the building permit phase of the Master Plan and
would take into consideration projected parking demand based on enrollment and the specific
building uses.

For the disclosure of parking impacts, this analysis considers development of up to 250
additional parking spaces. Under the initial redevelopment anticipated by 2022 (Phases 1



                                                                                                 41

through 3), a net increase of approximately 190 additional parking stalls are anticipated after
accounting for demolished and reconstructed parking spaces/garages. At 2037 buildout the
further addition of 60 parking stalls is anticipated for a total increased parking supply of
approximately 250 parking stalls.

Peak Demand
Similar to trip generation, changes in parking demand with the Master Plan would be
associated with increases in enrollment, the tennis center, public use of the sports fields as
well as events on campus related to the banquet facilities. Parking demand for Northwest
University is anticipated to be highest midday on a weekday when classes are in session.

Campus Parking
As described previously, the current campus contains 1,168 parking spaces and the existing
peak parking demand is 638 vehicles occurring between 10 and 11 a.m. The Kirkland
campus currently enrolls approximately 1,200 students, which would equate to 0.52
vehicles/student during the peak weekday parking period. Parking demand associated with
faculty, staff, and visitors is reflected in the existing demand and thus included in the rate.

As discussed previously, the University is projected to increase campus enrollment by 370
students by 2022 and 770 students by 2037. Table 22 summarizes the campus projected
weekday peak parking demand for 2022 and 2037 conditions.

Year                        Enrollment      Peak Parking Demand Rate           Demand
2015 / 2016                1,230 students        0.52 veh / student           638 vehicles
2022                       1,600 students        0.52 veh / student           830 vehicles
2037                       2,000 students        0.52 veh / student          1,040 vehicles


As shown in Table 22, parking demand would increase by approximately 200 vehicles by
2022 and an additional 200 vehicles by 2037.

Tennis Center Parking
Estimated weekday tennis center peak parking demand was calculated based on ITE Parking
Generation, 4th Edition. The racquet/tennis club (LU 491) average parking demand rate was
used to estimate the tennis center parking demand. A weekday peak parking demand of 11
vehicles is anticipated.

Public Field Use
The public sports field is anticipated to start operations after 4 p.m. and not expected to
produce parking demand between the 10 to 11 a.m. Based on similar assumptions as applied
to trip generation, peak parking demand for the public use of the sports fields assumes 128
children and 32 coaches with practice starting at 5:00 p.m. It assumes all the coaches and 90
percent of the children would arrive between 4-5 p.m. and 25 percent of the parents would
leave after dropping off the children. All the coaches are assumed to drive alone and parents
are assumed only to have only one child in a vehicle. The resulting peak parking demand is
160 vehicles.

Shared Parking Demand
Parking demand associated with general University operations would peak at a different time
of the day compared to the tennis center and public use of the field. The hourly parking
demand for the campus was reviewed to determine the adequacy of the campus parking


                                                                                                 42

supply. Appendix F provides a summary of the projected hourly parking demand for the site.
Hourly parking distributions for the Master Plan uses are based on:

                   Campus-Related Population Demand – Hourly parking data collected in March
                    2016 and ITE Parking Generation, 4th Edition data for the University/College (LU
                    550)
                   Tennis Center – ITE Parking Generation, 4th Edition data for the
                    Racquet/Tennis Club (LU 491)
                   Public Use of Sports Fields – Assuming all the coaches and 90 percent of the
                    children would arrive between 4-5 p.m., 25 percent of the parents would leave
                    after dropping off the children, practice is only 1-hour and only one soccer
                    practice session would occur during the weekday evening.
The project Master Plan weekday hourly parking demand is illustrated on Figure 16. As
shown on the figure, the peak parking demand for the campus occurs at approximately 10
a.m. consistent with existing conditions and would be approximately 1,050 vehicles. The
existing parking supply could accommodate the anticipated future peak parking demand with
the Master Plan for both 2022 (6-year) and 2037 (6-20 year) conditions. With build-out of the
Master Plan, parking utilization for the campus would be approximately 90 percent if no new
parking was constructed or 75 percent with an additional 250 parking spaces. As shown in
the existing conditions section, there are some parking lots on campus that are highly utilized
and others that have very low utilization. This shows that there is sufficient parking on
campus; however, it may not be in the most convenient location. If parking is not located
within a reasonable proximity of the site use, then campus-related traffic may be more likely
to park on-street. The provision of parking with the Master Plan would help distribute the
location of parking spaces within the campus as well as provide more conveniently located
parking for the proposed uses.

hourly parking demand presented on Figure 16 and with the proposed parking supply of
1,400 campus spaces, there would be approximately 400 parking spaces available on-
campus at 5 p.m. and parking availability would continue to increase throughout the evening.
The proposed parking supply would accommodate the anticipated banquet facility parking
needs.


Traffic Safety
Traffic generated by the proposed master plan would likely result in a proportionate increase
in the probability of collisions. As noted previously, the 116th Avenue NE / NE 70th Street
intersection was the only intersection where the observed crash rate was greater than the
critical crash rate. However, recently collisions have been decreasing at this location. The
City regularly monitors major intersections for safety issues and if a pattern of collisions is
identified potential safety improvements are reviewed.


Non-Motorized Facilities
The non-motorized facilities in the area as well as the linkages to the existing transit stops are
adequate to support the current and future increases in activity. As discussed previously, the
City’s Transportation Master Plan recommends NE 53rd Street as a future greenway to
accommodate bicycle activity and facilitate connectivity of the City’s bicycle network. The
proposed Master Plan would not preclude development of this greenway.


Transit Services
It is anticipated that existing transit services would be able to accommodate increases in
ridership as a result of the Master Plan and increases in enrollment. As previously described,
the nearest transit is located along 108th Avenue NE.


Transportation Concurrency
A transportation concurrency test was completed for this project by the City of Kirkland on
May 25, 2016. The proposed project passed the concurrency test based on the forecasted
person trip generation shown in the May 25, 2016 memorandum to Tony Leavitt, Senior
Planner from Thang Nguyen, Transportation Engineer subjected NW University Master Plan
Traffic Concurrency Test Notice, Tran16-00967. Appendix G contains the transportation
concurrency test notice. The concurrency test notice shall expire and a new concurrency test
application is required unless:
         A complete SEPA checklist, traffic impact analysis and all required documentation
          are submitted to the City within 90 calendar days of the concurrency test notice.
         A Certificate of Concurrency is issued or an extension is requested and granted by
          the Public Works Department within one year of issuance of the concurrency test
          notice. (A Certificate of Concurrency is issued at the same time a development permit
          or building permit is issued if the applicant holds a valid concurrency test notice.)
         A Certificate of Concurrency shall expire six years from the date of issuance of the
          concurrency test notice unless all building permits are issued for buildings approved
          under the concurrency test notice.

Northwest University Master Plan                                                          June 2016



                Mitigations and Recommendations
Potential mitigation measures are described below. The basic framework of the mitigation
plan includes recommendations with respect to:

              Intersection Improvements
              Traffic Calming
              Parking / Internal Campus Connectivity
              Event Management

In addition, the University would be responsible for payment of City of Kirkland transportation
impact fees to mitigate general transportation related impacts of the Master Plan.


Intersection Improvements
In addition, based on the traffic operations impacts at the study intersections, potential
mitigation measures were identified at the following locations:

              116th Avenue NE / NE 70th Place
              108th Avenue NE / NE 68th Street
              108th Avenue NE / NE 53rd Street

116th Avenue NE/NE 70th Place
Traffic operations at the 116th Avenue NE/NE 70th Place intersection are forecast to operate
at LOS F with the anticipated increase in on-campus student enrollment under either 2022 or
2037 conditions. These operations are also consistent with the 2015 Comprehensive Plan
Update DEIS findings, which identifies a southbound right-turn pocket at this intersection. The
right-turn would not improve intersection operations to pre-project conditions and the
feasibility of this improvement would need to be further explored. This intersection is
generally built out and payment of transportation impact fees supporting transportation
improvements throughout the City would mitigate project-related impacts at this location.

Mitigation of this intersection would likely be required by 2020, which coincides with the
current Phase 3 of development. The evaluation of timing for mitigation assumed completion
of the tennis center, public use of the sports field and incremental growth in student
enrollment over the next 4-years. It was assumed mitigation would be required when the
Master Plan’s proportionate share at this intersection would be greater than 5 percent.

108th Avenue NE/NE 68th Street
Under both 2022 and 2037 conditions, the 108th Avenue NE/NE 68th Street intersection
operates at LOS F either without or with the addition of project traffic and is consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan findings. As with other City intersections, this intersection is
generally built out with no public right-of-way available to construct additional lanes at the
intersection. The City’s 2015-2020 Capital Improvement Program includes the 6th Street
Corridor Study and Houghton/Everest Neighborhood Plan, which is underway. This study will
develop a corridor and neighborhood plan including transportation solutions to accommodate
growth in the study area. These solutions may include policies (e.g., parking policies),
projects (e.g., intersection improvements) and programs (e.g., bikeshare). Given constraints
along the corridor project will generally focus on transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities and
consider safety, geometrics, and other transportation conditions along the corridor.
