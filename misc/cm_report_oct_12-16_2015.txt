Town Manager's Report for October 12 - 16, 2015

Items to report on this week include the following:

Planning/ Building/ Engineering Update:

The City Engineer’s Report is attached. Items in red text note changes in project status from
last week.

The August Sewer System Manager’s progress report is attached.

The Town’s annual street rehab project is beginning to wind down. About 13.5% of the Town’s
public road miles were subject to rehab or resurfacing treatment. Photos of street work in
progress are attached.

The following project was approved at the October 13 Site Development hearing:
    A pool and hardscape at 10580 Berkshire Drive

The following project was approved at the October 13 Fast Track hearing:
    A second unit and addition to an existing residence at 11555 Hillpark Lane

The Planning Commission will hold a special meeting on Thursday, October 22 at 7:00
p.m. Items being considered at this meeting are the Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance,
Antenna Ordinance and a proposed new residence at 26691 Moody Road.

Public Safety Update:

The Sheriff’s weekly report is attached.

A resident complained to the Town Traffic Safety Committee and to the press about speeding
traffic on Moody Road after his dog, which was roaming at large, was hit by a vehicle that was
allegedly speeding on Moody Road. In response to the complaint, the Town also stepped up
traffic enforcement on Moody Road for a second time in 2015. Between July 29 and September
27, 136 citations were issued. At the request of the Traffic Safety Committee, the Town staff
also authorized a licensed traffic engineer to conduct a traffic study to see if a stop sign was
warranted at the intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road. The Study was completed
and it was determined that there is no basis or warrant for installing a stop sign at this
intersection. A copy of the Study is attached.

Administrative Services Update:

In response to FIC Chair Allan Epstein’s attached e-mail with regard to cash management
(Agenda Item 10C), Staff agrees that $3 mil in excess cash from our non-interest bearing Bank
of America Checking account should have been transferred to our interest bearing LAIF account
in January 2015. Staff believes that the Town missed interest earnings of about $3,000 during
this period. The transfer has since been completed and we do not anticipate that this will
happen again. At this time, the new Finance Director is pretty much up to speed on things and
we are beginning the recruitment for the vacant Finance Manager position. The issue of cash
management will likely be on the November FIC agenda. As of today, the Town’s current
remaining available checking account balance with BAC is $3,069,941.90.

Bank of America provided the Town with notice that they will no longer be servicing local
governments. The Town has six months to find a new bank. Staff will keep the City Council
updated on this matter.

Parks and Recreation Update:

The Vines and Wines event scheduled for next weekend Sunday, October 25th from has been
sold out with over 220 attendees and 26 LAH wine makers.

VDE is planning to move forward with the upper arena repair the week of October 26th. The
work will be started Monday October 26th and should be finished on Thursday October 29th. All
stakeholders have been notified.

GreenWaste Recovery conducted a Recycling Processing Tour Friday, October 16th 9:00-
10:30am. There were a tolal of 8 participants, 4 residents and 4 new staff members.

This week marks for me the completion of 16 years of service with the Town. Working for the
Town has afforded me some wonderful opportunities and I am really happy to be here.

Thanks.

II. PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR/CITY ENGINEER HIGHLIGHTS
   a. SEWER SYSTEM MAINTENANCE HIGHLIGHTS
   During the month of August 2015, the Town’s sewer maintenance contractor, West Bay Sanitary
   District (West Bay), completed all contract tasks on schedule. This month, West Bay began the first
   year of a new 3-year contract with the Town. No significant issues were noted during cleaning, CCTV
   inspection, or pump station inspections. Also, there were no recorded overflows in the system
   during this period.
   A summary of completed tasks is provided in Table 1, below. More detailed information is provided
   later in this report, and is also shown in the attached maps.

   cleaning progress for the Town’s pipes. Since August
   2014, 35.5 percent of the pipes within the Town’s
   collection system have been cleaned. Cleaning results
   from the previous contract year are shown in this
   chart. The two primary maintenance issues found in
   the pipes within the system from the previous year
   have been debris and roots. Debris found in pipes
   comprised of gravel, rock, paper, rags, egg shells,
   ground, grit, mud, and other solids. During the
   previous year, 18.9 percent of the cleaned pipes had
   debris, 8.6 percent had roots, and 6 percent had clear
   results.
   Figure 2b shows cleaning results for the Town’s pipes
   for the current contract year only. Figure 2b expands
   the wedge shown in yellow in Figure 2a. In August
   2015, 22.2 percent of the cleaned pipes had debris,
   18.5 percent had roots, and 18.5 percent had clear results. There was no mention of grease or
   broken pipe debris found during the August cleaning period.

   Figures 3a and 3b show CCTV inspection results for
   structural and O&M defects, respectively. As of
   August 2015, 20.5 percent of the system has been
   inspected. Of the 20.5 percent, 3 percent was
   inspected during the current year. During the
   previous year, 18.6 percent of the pipes that were
   inspected had National Association of Sewer Service
   Companies (NASSCO) Pipeline Assessment and
   Certification Program (PACP) Structural Grade 3 defects or less. NASSCO PACP characterizes

   Structural Grade 3 defects as requiring action in 10 or more years. The remaining 0.7 percent of
   pipes inspected in the prior year had structural Grade 4 or 5 defects, which are characterized by
   NASSCO as being likely to require action within 5 to 10 years.

   Less than three percent of the inspected pipes have     Figure 3b. CCTV Inspection Progress as of
   NASSCO PACP Operations and Maintenance (O&M)            August 31, 2015 (O&M)
   Grade 4 or 5 defects. These pipes have been or will
   be placed on the hot spot list until the O&M issues
   are resolved.     The remaining 19 percent of
   inspected pipes have O&M defects of 3 or below.
   The remaining 79.5 percent of pipes in the system
   require inspection by West Bay.

   Figures 4a and 4b show structural and O&M defects
   found during August 2015 inspections. These charts
   reflect results for 3 percent of the system. During
   this period, 34.5 percent of inspected pipes had no
   structural defects, 72.7 percent had Grade 3 defects
   or less, and 7.3 percent had Grade 4 or 5 defects.

   Less than 2 percent of the pipes that were inspected
   this new contract year have NASSCO PACP O&M
   Grade 5 defects and 45.5 percent have been recorded to have less than Grade 3 defects. In addition,
   there were no recorded O&M Grade 4 defects in the pipes during this reporting period.

   Table 2 on the following page shows SSOs to date by cause. Over the past 5 years, the predominant
   cause of SSOs has been roots. However, as indicated by the reduced number of SSOs in 2015, the
   use of chemical root control, combined with improved sewer maintenance methods in place by
   West Bay, have reduced root-related issues within the Town’s sewer system. During this reporting
   month, there were no recorded overflows that occurred in the Town’s system.

   Attachment I includes maps providing additional information on cleaning and CCTV inspection
   results.

   b. Summary of Meetings Held during Reporting Month
       There were no meetings held during this reporting month.
   c. Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) Updates
       During the reporting month, aside from routine input of cleaning and CCTV inspection progress
       to date, there were no further changes made to the CMMS.
   d. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Progress on Manhole Data Collection
       During the reporting month, West Bay made no changes to the Town’s sewer GIS maps. West
       Bay collected GIS map changes during work completed in the first year of the contract, and will
       incorporate these changes into the current maps by December 2015.
       VWHA is compiling manholes that will be important for development of the hydraulic model,
       and will provide a map and list of manholes to West Bay needed for data collection by October
       2015.
   e. Maintenance Planning
       During the reporting month, no issues were identified to warrant changes to the Town’s
       cleaning or CCTV inspection program. West Bay will continue to clean basins that have the
       highest risk for maintenance-related SSOs, including Branch 5 and the remainder of Branch 2, as
       defined by the Town’s GIS maps. VWHA is currently reviewing other branches in the system as

    Subject:    Moody Road Traffic Calming Study 
                 
      The purpose of this memorandum is to present the results of a traffic calming study along Moody Road 
      between Altamont Road and Old Snakey Road in the Town of Los Altos Hills. Included is evaluation of 
      traffic speeds, volumes and safety conditions on Moody Road, and a Stop Warrant Analysis at the 
      intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road. A review of prior studies, new data collection for 
      existing conditions, and field observations were performed to provide a deeper understanding of the 
      traffic conditions and to develop appropriate recommendations. The study area is illustrated in Figure 1. 

      Traffic Calming Evaluation 

      Field Review 

      Thorough field observations were conducted during the AM and PM peak periods in the study area. Our 
      observations revealed that the traffic volumes on Moody Road are not excessive, experiencing an 
      average daily traffic of approximately 1,300 vehicles. Minor streets intersecting Moody Road provide 
      access to a few homes in residential neighborhoods and do not generate a significant amount of 
      vehicular traffic. Vehicle platooning was not prevalent on Moody Road, providing generous gaps for 
      vehicles from the minor streets to merge onto Moody Road. 

      Sight distances meet Highway Design Manual standards, though the area is mountainous and heavily 
      wooded. The roadway is winding, which can result in lower speeds. Pedestrians have a path on the 
      south side of Moody Road, which effectively removes them from the vehicular travelled way. Bicyclists 
      do not have dedicated space on the road, but drivers acknowledge their presence and react accordingly. 

      Existing Conditions Data Collection 

      To perform the Stop Warrant Analysis, 12‐hour turning movement volumes were collected at the 
      intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road. The data also provides insight into typical operation 
      of Moody Road over the course of a typical weekday. Throughout the day, there is an average of 
      approximately 110 vehicles travelling along Moody Road in one‐hour, with the maximum being 140 
      vehicles in an hour.

With a low traffic volume of 140 vehicles per hour, the arrival rate is approximately two vehicles per 
minute. This rate reveals that there is approximately 30 seconds between the arrival of any two vehicles, 
assuming an even traffic distribution, during the peak hour on the major road. A 30‐second gap is ample 
time for vehicles on the minor street approaches to merge onto Moody Road. 

Conclusion 

Moody Road is a winding road with gentle vertical curves that naturally forces drivers to travel at 
reasonable speeds.  The low traffic volumes and regular gaps in the vehicle stream allow movements 
from side streets with minimal delay. Pedestrians have a dedicated path, and drivers were observed to 
respect bicyclists on the road. In absence of any documented safety issues, no traffic improvements are 
warranted at this time. 

 

Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road Stop Warrant Analysis 

A Stop Warrant Analysis per California Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) 2014 was 
performed. The analysis required 8‐hour traffic volume data, 85th percentile speeds and an analysis of 
collision history. The warrant analysis is included in Appendix A. Images of Moody Road from the Rhus 
Ridge Road northbound approach are presented below. 

The engineering analysis indicate that an all‐way stop control (AWSC) is not warranted at the 
intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road. Traffic volumes, collected at this intersection on 
September 1, 2015 are not high enough to meet thresholds required by warrant criteria. Additionally, 
bicycle and pedestrian volumes are under the thresholds required by other criteria. The volumes 
collected are included in Appendix B. The 85th percentile speed on Moody Road was measured at 36 
mph as of May 2014. This measurement is used in the warrant analysis to determine if the criteria 
thresholds of the warrant may be reduced. The measured speed is below the threshold, and therefore 
no reduction in required volumes was applied.  

Collision history was evaluated over a five‐year period (January 2010‐February 2015). Six accidents were 
reported during this time, and none occurred at the intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road. 
Collision history is used in the warrant analysis to determine if there are significant bicycle and 
pedestrian safety concerns that would show improvement with the installation of AWSC. Because no 
accidents were at the study intersection, this criterion was also not met. Of the six accidents reported 
during the study period in the vicinity, two were a result of unsafe speed, while the remaining four were 
due to extraneous driver circumstances or weather conditions. The collision history and additional traffic 
survey information used in the analysis are included in Appendix C.

Conclusions 

This extensive engineering analysis resulted in the following conclusions: 

    1. Traffic volumes and speeds along Moody Road between Altamont Road and Old Snakey Road 
       are reasonable, and allow normal movement from minor streets with negligible delay. The 
       roadway accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists, and driver behavior indicates respect for 
       pedestrians and bicyclists. There are no apparent traffic safety issues. No traffic calming 
       improvements are recommended at this time. 
    2. Based on the traffic speeds, volumes and safety conditions, an AWSC is not warranted at the 
       intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road, per CA MUTCD guidelines.

          Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices Warrants Study for All‐Way Stops 
 
The Town of Los Altos Hills has requested to check the feasibility of implementing All‐Way Stop Control 
at the intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road to reduce speeds, and promote pedestrian and 
bicycle safety. Currently, the intersection operates with One‐Way Stop Control (OWSC). 
 
Guidance:  
     The decision to install multiway stop control should be based on an engineering study. The following 
     criteria should be considered in the engineering study for a multiway STOP sign installation:  
 
     A. Where traffic control signals are justified, the multiway stop is an interim measure that can. Be 
          installed quickly to control traffic while arrangements are being made for the installation of the 
          traffic control signal. 
           
          The intersection operates with OWSC and the City is not looking to convert to traffic signal 
          control. 
           
     B. A crash problem, as indicated by 5 or more reported crashes in a 12‐month period that are 
          susceptible to correction by a multiway stop installation. Such crashes include right‐ and left 
          turn collisions as well as right‐angle collisions. 
 
          Collision Data was obtained for a 62‐month period from January 2010 to February 2015. During 
          this time, there were six reported collisions on Moody Road between Altamont Road and 
          Murietta Lane, none of which occurred at the intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road. 
           
                                        This warrant is not met for the study intersection. 
           
     C. Minimum volumes:  
           
               1. The vehicular volume entering the intersection from the major street approaches (total 
                   of both approaches) averages at least 300 vehicles per hour for any 8 hours of an 
                   average day, and  
                    
                   The maximum average vehicular volume for 8 hours was observed to be 123 vehicles. 
                    
                                        This warrant is not met for the study intersection. 
                    
               2. The combined vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle volume entering the intersection from 
                   the minor street approaches (total of both approaches) averages at least 200 units per 
                   hour for the same 8 hours, with an average delay to minor‐street vehicular traffic of at 
                   least 30 seconds per vehicle during the highest hour, but  
 
                   The combined volume entering the intersection from the minor street approach (Rhus 
                   Ridge Road) for the same 8‐hour period as in Criteria C.1 was observed to be 91 units. 
                    
                                        This warrant is not met for the study intersection. 
                    
           3. If the 85th‐percentile approach speed of the major‐street traffic exceeds 65 km/h or 
               exceeds 40 mph, the minimum vehicular volume warrants are 70 percent of the above 
               values.  
                
               85th‐percentile speed was measured to be 36 mph on May 20, 2014. 
                
                                              This warrant is not applicable. 
                
    D. Where no single criterion is satisfied, but where Criteria B, C.1, and C.2 are all satisfied to 80 
       percent of the minimum values. Criterion C.3 is excluded from this condition.  
        
                                              This warrant is not applicable. 
 
Other criteria that may be considered in an engineering study include: 
 
A. The need to control left‐turn conflicts: 
          
    There were no left‐turn conflicts witnessed during the 60‐month collision analysis period, therefore 
    this criterion is not met. 
 
B. The need to control vehicle/pedestrian conflicts near locations that generate high pedestrian 
    volumes: 
     
    There were no reported collisions at the intersection of Moody Road and Rhus Ridge Road pertaining 
    to pedestrians during the 60‐month collision analysis period, therefore this criterion is not met. 
 
C. Locations where a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to 
    reasonably safely negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop: 
 
    The traffic volumes on Moody Road are low and vehicles existing from the existing stop control on 
    Rhus Ridge Road experience many available gaps to make turns onto Moody Road. The northbound 
    approach of Rhus Ridge Road provides adequate sight distance along Moody Road as determined by 
    the Highway Design Manual (HDM); therefore, this criterion is not met. 
 
D. An intersection of two residential neighborhood collector (through) streets of similar design and 
    operating characteristics where multiway stop control would improve traffic operational 
    characteristics of the intersection: 
     
    The intersecting roads are located in a residential neighborhood and facilitates commuter traffic 
    movement onto larger collector streets in the Town. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

                           Los Altos Hills, California

STREET: Moody Road                                 LOCATION: 20
SEGMENT: Altamont Road to 0.1 mile west of Murietta Lane (Town Limit)

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Segment Length: 1.03 miles
Travel Lanes: 2
Shoulders: None. Curbs.
Parking Lanes: None. There are signs near Rhus Ridge Road stating “Additional Parking at Foothill
College” and “No Parking on Pathway Any Time” to discourage on-street parking on Moody.
Bike Lanes: 0 Heavy bicycle traffic.
Adjacent Land Use: Residential
Alignment, Grades: Curvilinear, rolling.
Sight Distance: Some restricted sight distances around curves.


TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS
Average Daily Traffic: 1286
Reported Accidents in 3-Year Period (Jan. 2010 – Dec. 2013): 5
Accidents per million vehicle miles: 3.447
2.17 accidents per million vehicle miles is the average of all surveyed streets in Los Altos Hills

SPEED DATA AND RECOMMENDATION
85th Percentile Speed (Critical Speed): 36 mph
Measurement taken with tubes on May 20, 2014.
Existing Speed Limit: 30 mph
Recommended Speed Limit: 30 mph

Section 2B.13 of the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUCTD) states that speed limits are
to be established at the nearest 5 mph increment of the 85 th percentile speed of free-flowing traffic, except that
the posted speed may be reduced by 5 mph from the nearest 5 mph increment of the 85 th percentile speed if the
conditions and justification for the lower speed limit are documented by a registered traffic engineer. In
establishing speed limits, consideration is to be given to such other factors as road characteristics, shoulder
condition, grade, alignment, and sight distance; reported collision experience for at least a 12-month period;
pedestrian and bicyclist safety; length of speed zones so as to avoid very short speed zones; and coordination with
adjacent jurisdictions. The speed limit recommended in this E&TS is in accordance with the provisions of CA
MUCTD and recommends a reduction of 5 mph from the nearest 5 mph increment of the 85th percentile speed,
based on the following factors:

Speed limit should be set 5 mph lower than the nearest increment of the 85th percentile speed due to
higher than average accident rate, lack of shoulders or bike lanes, restricted sight distances in several
places, and heavy bicycle usage (bicyclist safety).

Hi Carl,
 
The Council did not discuss this matter last night, but I wanted to mention to you some observations.  A
  discriminating reader can see that the large build up in cash in the B of A account was both inconsistent
  with the stated cash management policy and demonstrates poor cash management practices. 
  Considering the change in staffing due to Yulia's leaving I can understand how this might occur  and I am
  certainly not critical of Pak who has jumped in doing both the finance manager and administrative
  director's jobs, budget and audit, all while being short staffed.  However, it is fair to say that the failure to
  invest excess funds and close the unused Coamerica account has probably unnecessarily cost the Town
  in the neighborhood of $10K during 2015.  I plan to place the subject of cash management on the FIC's
  November agenda and have offered Pak the FIC's assistance should she need help in the treasury
  function.  I don't know, but it is possible she may have had little exposure to treasury work in her prior
  positions.
 
Best,
Allan
