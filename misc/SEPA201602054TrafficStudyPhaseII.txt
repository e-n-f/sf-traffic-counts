Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                 November 2016



                                Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Transportation Impact Analysis through a
set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

Where is the project located and what would be developed?
The project is located south of NE 90th Street and east of 154th Avenue NE. The proposal
includes demolish of the existing industrial park use and construction of a Hopelink Integrated
Service Center totaling 27,860 square-feet.

What existing public streets will serve the project and where is access proposed?
NE 90th Street and 154th Avenue NE are the two primary roadways within the surrounding
area serving site traffic. Access to the site would be via the existing shared driveway located
on 154th Avenue NE.

Is the site currently served by public transit?
Access to transit is provided along the adjacent NE 90th Street and 154th Avenue NE and
NE 85th Street to the site. The closest transit stops to the project site are at the NE 90th
Street/154th Avenue NE, NE 90th Street/151st Avenue NE, and 154th Avenue NE/NE 90th
Street intersections.

How many new parking spaces are proposed?
The proposed project would construct 74 parking spaces.

How many peak hour vehicular trips would the project generate?
On a typical weekday, PM peak hour vehicular traffic would be generated by Client Services
and Administrative Office uses. Approximately 2 to 4 times per month (no more than once per
week), it is anticipated that a food bank would occur during the weekday PM peak hour
resulting in higher trip generation for the site. Considering traffic already being generated by
the existing use, the proposed project would result in 24 net new weekday PM peak hour trips
when no food bank occurred and 45 net new weekday PM peak hour trips when there is a
food bank.

What Transportation impacts are anticipated, if any?
The evaluation of potential transportation-related impacts was conducted for the peak trip
generation scenario when a food bank would be in session representing the worst-case. The
analysis shows that weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes would increase by 1 to 2 percent,
which is within the range of daily fluctuation in traffic. The City of Redmond has an adopted
LOS D standard. The resulting increase in traffic is not anticipated to degrade intersection
LOS or increase delays at intersection already operating at LOS E or worse.

What measures are proposed to reduce or control traffic impacts?
The project would be required to implement a Transportation Management Program for the
site to manage site access, availability of parking for employees and visitors to the site, and
to reduce the level of traffic generation during weekday morning and afternoon peak travel
hours. In addition, payment of the City’s transportation impact fee would be required. The
preliminary estimate of the impact fee is $162,413.

Transportation Impact Analysis
Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                   November 2016



                                        Introduction
The purpose of this Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is to identify potential
transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed Hopelink Redmond Integrated
Service Center. As necessary, mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce
significant impacts.


Project Description
Hopelink is a private nonprofit organization serving King and Snohomish Counties, which
assists families in crisis with food, shelter, transportation, utility assistance and emergency
financial assistance. In order to meet local demand and better serve community needs,
Hopelink is developing an Integrated Service Center to be located at the 15511 NE 90th
Street in Redmond. The project site is located at south of NE 90th Street and east of 154th
Avenue NE. Figure 1 shows the site and vicinity.

The existing Redmond Service Center is located on leased property that Hopelink would
vacate. The Hopelink Administrative Offices, located at 10675 Willows Road NE, and the
Food Bank and Client/Emergency Service Center, located at 16725 Cleveland Street in
Redmond, would both be relocated to the proposed project site. The new service center will
include Client/Emergency Service Offices, Administrative Offices, associated conference and
meeting space and a Food Bank with Food Bank Storage area.

The project would redevelop the site, which currently has two buildings totaling 34,400
square feet of industrial park, to provide a 27, 860 square foot Integrated Service Center.
Access to the site for all vehicular traffic would be via the existing shared driveway located on
154th Avenue NE. The proposed project would provide 74 parking spaces. Figure 2
illustrates the site plan. This project is anticipated to be completed in 2018.


Analysis Scope and Study Area
The scope of this study was based on the City of Redmond Application Requirements for
PREP – Land Use Entitlement, Part 4: Requirements for Traffic Study, March 2015 as well as
coordinated with City staff. The study area focuses on key intersections along NE 90th Street,
as well as the site access driveway. Key transportation elements reviewed include the
adjacent street system, non-motorized facilities, transit service, existing traffic volumes, traffic
operations, and traffic safety.

City of Redmond guidelines note that all signalized intersections impacted by 20 or more
project-generated trips in the weekday PM peak hours are to be included as part of the study
area. There are two project trip generation scenarios: (1) typical trip generation, when the
Food Bank is closed and (2) peak trip generation, when Food Bank is open. The peak trip
generation only occurs 2 to 4 times per month. Given the uniqueness and variability of the
project trip generation, the study area was coordinated with City staff to include the key
intersection in the immediate vicinity of the site.

The study intersections include (see also Figure 1):
    1. Willows Road/NE 90th Street
    2. 154th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street
    3. 160th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street
    4. 154th Avenue NE/Site Access Driveway

Transportation Impact Analysis
Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                   November 2016


Consistent with the City’s guidelines, the analysis focuses on the weekday PM peak period
(4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) operations at the study intersections. This period represents the highest
cumulative total traffic for the adjacent street system providing a conservative timeframe for
Level of Service (LOS) analysis.

The analysis begins by describing conditions in the vicinity of the project site including the
street system, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, transit service, and non-motorized facilities. Future (2018)
with-project conditions are determined by adding site-generated traffic to future without-
project volumes. The project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation system were
identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the future without-project
conditions.

   Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
identified study area. Characteristics are provided for the street system, non-motorized
facilities, transit service, existing traffic volumes, traffic operations, and traffic safety.


Street System
The project site is located in Redmond bound by NE 90th Street to the north and 154th
Avenue NE to the west. The major streets within the study area include:

NE 90th Street is a four-lane east-west roadway classified as a principal arterial with
sidewalks on both sides. NE 90th Street includes a two-way left-turn lane between Willows
Road and 154th Avenue NE. The posted speed limit is 40 miles per hour (mph). The shoulder
and roadway widths are approximately 4-feet and 35-feet, respectively. There is a gradual
increase in street grade east of 154th Avenue NE.

154th Avenue NE is a three-lane roadway classified as a principal arterial with sidewalks on
both sides, including a two-way left-turn lane. This roadway provides north-south access
within the site vicinity. Site access to the proposed project would be via the existing shared
driveway on 154th Avenue NE south of NE 90th Street. The posted speed limit is 30 mph.
The shoulder and roadway widths are approximately 6-feet and 35 feet, respectively. This
street is relatively flat within the study area.

160th Avenue NE is a north-south collector arterial. The road provides two lanes in each
direction and a center two-way left-turn lane. The posted speed limit is 30 mph in the vicinity
of the project, and sidewalk are provided along both sides of the roadway. The shoulder and
roadway widths are approximately 8-feet and 40 feet, respectively. This street is relatively flat
within the study area.

Willows Road is a two-lane roadway classified as a minor arterial with sidewalks on the west
side of the roadway south of NE 90th Street and sidewalks on both sides to the north. The
posted speed limit is 35 mph. The shoulder and roadway widths are approximately 4- feet
and 55-feet, respectively. This street is relatively flat within the study area.


Planned Roadway Improvements
The City of Redmond’s 2016-2021 Six-Year Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) was
reviewed to determine planned improvements that could occur by 2018 (project opening
year). The NE 90th Street Bridge Deck Maintenance Study, Willows Road Rehabilitation, and
Redmond Central Connector Phase 2 projects will provide improvements within the study
area; however, these projects will not impact intersection traffic control or geometrics at the
study intersections.


Non-Motorized Facilities
Sidewalks are provided along all of the nearby streets with crosswalks located at major
intersections allowing safe pedestrian mobility throughout the area. Signalized crossings are
provided at the NE 90th Street intersections with 154th Avenue NE and 160th Avenue NE
and at the Willows Road/NE 90th Street intersection. Bicycle facilities surrounding the project
site are shared in lane with general motor vehicle traffic.

Transit Service
The immediate site vicinity is served by King County Metro Transit. The nearest transit stops
include the RapidRide B line stops located along NE 90th Street at 154th Avenue NE on the
north side of the project site. There are also 2 stops south of the project site served by Route
930. Additional transit service is provided along NE 85th Street approximately 1,000-feet or a
5-minute walking distance south of the project site. In additional to King County Metro, Sound
Transit provides service along NE 85th Street.

The service areas, operating hours, and weekday PM peak hour headways for routes within
the project vicinity are summarized in Table 1. As shown in the table, most of the service is
provided to the Eastside area and headways are on average about 30 minutes.

The Redmond Transit Center is approximately 1-mile southeast of the project site along NE
83rd Street. The transit center provides regional access via the routes outlined in Table 1 as
well as additional routes serving Bellevue, Kirkland, Bothell, and Overlake.


Traffic Volumes
As mentioned previously, this transportation impact analysis focuses on the weekday PM
peak hour when traffic conditions would be greatest. Existing turning movement counts at the
study intersections and driveways were counted in May 2016. The detailed intersection
turning movement count worksheets are provided in Appendix A. Existing weekday PM peak
hour traffic volumes were used to establish existing traffic conditions and are shown on
Figure 3.

Traffic volume forecasts account for regional growth identified in the City’s Comprehensive
Plan. Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted using an annual
background growth of 2.0 percent per year. This growth rate was developed in coordination
with City staff and no specific pipeline development projects were identified in the vicinity of
the study intersections. Future without-project PM Peak hour traffic volumes are summarized
on Figure 4.

Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                                            November 2016


In addition to weekday PM peak period turning movement counts at the study intersections,
daily counts were conducted for 3-days between May 24 and 26, 2016 to determine the
Average Weekday Traffic (AWDT) volumes and the 85th percentile speeds. Data was
collected along NE 90th Street, east of 154th Avenue NE and is provided in Appendix A.
Based on these counts, AWDT volumes along NE 90th Street are 7,945 vehicles per day
(vpd) in the eastbound direction and 7,752 vpd in the westbound direction for a total of
15,697 vpd (see Figure 3). In addition, the 85th percentile speed in the eastbound and
westbound directions are 36.3 mph and 35.4 mph, respectively. As discussed previously, the
speed limited along NE 90th Street is 40 mph; therefore, the majority of the traffic along this
roadway is travelling at a speed that is slightly less than the posted speed.


Traffic Operations
The LOS analysis method was based on procedures identified in the Highway Capacity
Manual (2010), and evaluated using Synchro version 9.0.

At signalized intersections, LOS is measured in average control delay per vehicle and is
typically reported using the intersection delay and volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C). At stop-
sign-controlled intersections, LOS is measured in delay per vehicle. Traffic operations for an
intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A through
F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and
long vehicle delays. PM peak hour traffic operations were evaluated at the study intersections
based on LOS. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Based on the City’s Traffic Study Requirements, Redmond has adopted an LOS D standard
for all city roadways. Table 2 summarizes the existing and future without-project weekday PM
peak hour LOS at study intersections. The detailed LOS worksheets are included in Appendix
C.

As shown in the table, all study intersections currently operate at LOS D or better with the
exception of one intersection. The Willows Road/NE 90th Street intersection currently
operates at LOS F.

Under future (2018) without-project conditions all study intersections are anticipated to
operate at the same LOS as under existing conditions with the exception of one intersection.
The 160th Avenue/NE 90th Street intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS D to LOS
E under future (2018) without-project conditions.

Traffic Safety
The City of Redmond provided collision data for the most recent three-year period for
intersections and roadway segments within the study area. Specifically, the data was
summarized between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. Table 3 provides a summary
of collision history within the study area.

1. Million Entering Vehicles
2. Million Vehicle Miles Traveled


The City identifies intersection safety issues by reviewing collisions by Million Entering
Vehicles (MEV) and trends in accident type. The review of the collision rate allows a uniform
standard for evaluating accident history by incorporating traffic volumes. Generally, a collision
rate at intersections greater than 1.0 to 1.5 collisions per MEV is considered higher than
normal. Based on this threshold, there are no safety issues identified at the study
intersections. In addition, there are relatively few collisions per mile along the nearby roadway
vicinity and no safety issues are identified along roadways within the site vicinity.

No fatalities or bicyclist collisions were reported at a study intersection; however, one
pedestrian collision occurred at the 154th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street intersection. This
collision was the result of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian as it was making a right turn from the
154th Avenue NE south approach to the NE 90th Street east approach. The most common
collision type within the study area was rear-end collisions. This type of collision is common
at signalized or congested locations where there is frequent stop-and-go traffic.

The segment of NE 90th Street between Willows Road and 154th Avenue NE has 1 collision
per million miles travelled. Collisions occurred in 2013 and 2015, but no collisions occurred in
2014. Of the 6 reported collisions over the 3-years, 3 collisions were related to fixed objects
with a driver hitting a traffic island or street light pole, 2 collisions were related to an existing
driveway, and 1 collision was a sideswipe related to changing lanes. The causes of the
collisions were related to driver under the influence, inattention, and failure to grant right-of-
way. Overall, there is no specific pattern of collisions identified for this roadway segment.


Existing Parking
Per the City’s traffic study requirements, existing site parking was reviewed. The existing
building is 34,400 square-feet and has a total of 40 stalls on-site. The site is currently zoned
Manufacturing Park (MP) with a parking requirement of 69 to 103 stalls based on City of

Redmond Zoning Code1. Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers Parking
Generation, 4th Edition, the average peak parking demand for industrial park (#130) use is
1.27 vehicles per 1,000 square-feet gross floor area (GFA) resulting in a peak parking
demand of 44 vehicles for the site. Field observations indicated approximately 11 vehicles
parked on site during the afternoon peak period. The proposed project would remove the
existing use and associated parking.

  City of Redmond Zoning Code specifies a minimum of 2 spaces per 1,000 square-feet GFA and a maximum of 3
spaces per 1,000 square-feet GFA for MP zones.

                                     Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents project-generated impacts on the surrounding street
system and at the study intersections. First, peak hour traffic volumes are estimated,
distributed, and assigned to adjacent streets and intersections within the study area. Next,
2018 volumes are projected and potential impact to traffic volumes, traffic operations and
non-motorized facilities are identified.

Trip Generation
The proposed project would redevelop approximately 34,400 square feet of industrial park
with a 27,860 square-foot Hopelink Integrated Service Center. The service center has several
different components including Administrative Offices and Food Bank/Client Services.
Weekday PM peak hour trip generation for the facility was based on site specific data as well
as the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition,
2012). This section describes the trip generation for each project component.
    1. Administrative Office. Trip generation for the office component was based on the
       average trip rate for the Single Tenant Office building (land use #715) published in
       the ITE Trip Generation Manual. The ITE definition for single tenant office building
       includes consideration of offices and conference/meeting spaces. Trips associated
       with the administrative office component during the weekday PM peak hour would be
       related to employees.
    2. Food Bank/Client Services. Hopelink assists families in crisis with food, shelter,
       transportation, utility assistance, and emergency financial assistance. Hopelink’s
       services include the Food Bank, which does not occur regularly, and Client Services,
       that are provided daily. ITE Trip Generation does not provide data for a use similar to
       the Hopelink food bank and client services; therefore, data was collected at existing
       facilities. The procedure for data collection and estimating trip generation following
       those outlined in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 3rd Edition. Data was collected
       at the existing Redmond and Bellevue Hopelink facilities. Appendix D provides a
       summary of the data collected, which was conducted during the weekday PM period
       for 6 days on a day when the Food Bank was in operation as well as for 6 days when
       there were just client services provided and the Food Bank was not in operation.
       Most food banks at Hopelink facilities operate during off-peak hours. The Food Bank
       coinciding with the weekday PM peak hour is on Wednesdays at the existing
       Redmond Hopelink facility and Tuesdays at the Bellevue Hopelink facility.
Given the varying level of monthly activity, traffic generation was estimated for a weekday PM
peak hour with and without Food Bank operations. The trip estimates are based on the
Redmond and Bellevue Hopelink facilities. Trip rates were calculated using household per
year as the units to better capture the impact of facility operations. Based on coordination
with Hopelink staff, the geometric size of the facility does not affect the facility’s operations
because Client Services and Food Bank appointments and hours are dictated by the number
of households within the facilities service area. Consideration of households served for Client
Services and Client Services/Food Bank operations better reflect the anticipated customers
and associated traffic generated to and from the site.
As discussed, the independent variable for facility “size” was measured by number of
households served, as this better represents the population generating trips to the site.
Previous reviews of trip generation (i.e., the Phase One Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond
Integrated Service Center2), examined square-footage as an independent variable; however,
based on further discussion with Hopelink staff the size of the building does not necessarily

correspond to the population coming to and from the site and smaller buildings could serve
higher populations (i.e., more households) whereas larger buildings could serve smaller
population. The existing Redmond Hopelink serves approximately 560 households per year
for Client Services and 2,990 households per year for the Food Bank.

As described above, trip rates were developed from data collected over 6 weekdays when
both Food Bank and Client Services were operational, as well as 6 weekdays with only Client
Service operations. Vehicle trips during the weekday PM peak hour for each data collection
day were used to determine a trip rate in trips per 1,000 households served for Client
Services only and Food Bank/Client Services. Trip rates were then applied to projected
households served in 2018 to determine the project’s primary trips. For the proposed project,
the households served per year are anticipated to grow by approximately 8 percent per year
for the Food Bank and a total of 120 households by 2018 for Client Services. Therefore, by
2018, the Redmond facility is projected to serve approximately 3,500 households per year for
combined Client Services/Food Bank operations and approximately 685 households for
Client Services.

Table 4 shows the resulting weekday PM peak hour vehicle trip generation for the site during
Food Bank and non-Food Bank days. The existing site use was also taken into consideration
to determine the net new weekday PM peak hour trips generated by the proposed project.
Trip generation for the existing site use was based on ITE’s Industrial Park (#130) land use.

1. Number of households served.
2. Trip rate in trips per 1,000 households served. Rates were developed from data collected at the existing Redmond and Bellevue
    Hopelink facilities during food bank and non-food bank days.

As shown in table, during the majority of weekdays the proposed project would generate 23
net new weekday PM peak hour trips with no Food Bank. During a day when a Food Bank
occurs, the proposed project is anticipated to generate 44 new weekday PM peak hour trips.

Transportation Impact Analysis
Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                           November 2016


The trip generation in this study is different than disclosed in the Phase One Traffic Study:
Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center3. The Phase One Traffic Study trip generation
was based on only three data points and included the Kirkland Hopelink site. Based on
further discussion with Hopelink, the Kirkland site operates differently than the Redmond
Hopelink because it does not have an appointment system. The appointment system that is
employed by Redmond Hopelink caps the number of customers that are served with an
allowance up to 15 per half-hour. In addition to collecting additional data to determine trip
generation, the sites selected for this Phase Two Traffic Study were the existing Redmond
Hopelink site, that will be relocated, and the Bellevue Hopelink site, which both have similar
operations to the proposed project. The resulting trip generation is more representative of
what is anticipated at the proposed project.

Travel mode splits were determined based on field observations and survey results at the
existing Redmond Hopelink sites. For the Hopelink administrative services travel surveys
indicate for the 25 existing employees that currently work at the Willow Road office and would
be relocated to this new facility, 92 percent drive alone, 4 percent use transit, and 4 percent
carpool. It is noted that the proposed project site has better access to transit compared to the
current location and the proposal is located in closer proximity to residential uses; therefore, it
is anticipated that transit use would increase and as employees move closer to work, and
walking and biking may increase as well. Based on observations at the Cleveland Street
Hopelink facility, customers primarily used auto for Client Services and Food Bank
appointments. As noted above, the proposed site is located in closer proximity to transit and
residential uses; therefore, use of other modes such as transit, walking, and biking would
likely increase at the proposed project site. The trip generation disclosed above is considered
conservative since it does not take into consideration potential shifts from auto travel to
alternative modes.

As described previously, ITE does not provide a specific land use category for food bank and
client services. The City of Redmond’s transportation concurrency and transportation impact
fees are based on categories consistent with the ITE Trip Generation Manual. In order to
perform the transportation concurrency and impact fee calculations for the food bank and
client services components of the project, the typical scenario trip generation in Table 4 was
compared to the ITE Trip Generation Manual land use categories. This review shows that trip
generation and distribution characteristics for the client services component of the project
would be most similar to the shopping center land use (#820). Application of the average rate
for the shopping center use results in 30 weekday PM peak hour trips for the proposed 8,030
square-foot client services space, which is just 3 more trips (see Table 4) than anticipated
based on the site specific surveys. For the food bank component, during a typical scenario,
this facility would be used for storage with no specific trips associated with the storage. Given
the storage use, the ITE warehousing land use (#150) is used for the concurrency and impact
fee calculations. A 5,700 square-foot warehouse would generate 2 weekday PM peak hour
trips.

The remaining analysis described in this chapter focuses on the peak scenario when the
Food Bank is open to provide a conservative estimate of potential project impacts. During
typical conditions (see Table 4), traffic levels would be lower and transportation impacts
would be anticipated to be similar to or less than disclosed.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
Trip distribution patterns for the proposed project are based on existing travel patterns in the
area as well as on consideration of the Food Bank and Client Service area for the Redmond
Hopelink site since the majority of trips during the peak scenario would be related to
customers. The resulting distribution patterns are shown on Figure 5 and summarized below.
        15 percent to/from the west via 148th Avenue NE
        10 percent to/from the south via 154th Avenue NE
        70 percent to/from the south via 160th Avenue NE
       5 percent to/from the northeast via Woodinville-Redmond Road NE
It is noted that the distribution to the south via 160th Avenue NE may be less during non-
Food Bank days; however, trip generation on non-Food Bank days is anticipated to be less,
which results in impacts similar to or less than disclosed. Project trips from the project site
were assigned to the street network from the proposed driveway location at 154th Avenue
NE.
The remaining analysis presented focuses on the peak trip generation scenario to provide an
understanding of the potential worse case transportation impacts of the proposed project.

Traffic Volumes
The project traffic volumes were added to the future (2018) without-project traffic volumes to
form the basis of the future (2018) with-project analysis. Figure 6 shows the future (2018)
with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.

1. Project traffic represents net new trips for the peak scenario with the food bank in operations.


As shown in the table, project traffic would account for about 1 to 2 percent of the total PM
peak hour traffic volume at the study intersections in 2018. Traffic volumes fluctuate from
day-to-day and this is within the range of daily fluctuation.


Traffic Operations
Intersection operations analysis was conducted in the study area to evaluate the future 2018
conditions with the development of the project. Intersection LOS were calculated at the study
intersections using the LOS methodology described previously. Signal timing at the study
intersections was assumed to be consistent with existing conditions.

Table 6 provides a comparison between the 2018 with- and without-project conditions. The
detailed LOS worksheets and signal timing are included in Appendix C.

As shown in the table, future 2018 intersection operations are anticipated to be similar
without and with the proposed project at the study intersections. The proposal is not
anticipated to increase delay at the Willows Road/NE 90th Street and 160th Avenue NE/NE
90th Street intersections, which are anticipated to operate below the City’s LOS D standard.
In addition, the driveway operations would improve because the majority of traffic is
anticipated to travel eastbound right from the site.




                                                                     17

Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                                 November 2016


It is noted that northbound left-turn queues along 154th Avenue NE at the NE 90th Street
intersection could extend beyond the project driveway during the peak period making it
difficult to make a southbound left-turn into the site (see queue worksheets in Appendix C).
The assignment of project trips to the study area represents a worse case impact at the study
intersections. During peak periods with the food bank, it is anticipated that if there is difficulty
making this left-turn movement traffic may re-route in order to make a right-turn into the site.

In addition to a review of queues at the 154th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street intersection, the
driveway was reviewed to understand the southbound left-turn queues given that the
driveway may be block by northbound queues. SimTraffic simulation software was used to
determine the potential queues at the driveway. Based on SimTraffic, it is anticipated that the
95th-percentile4 southbound queue at the driveway would be approximately 110-feet. The
154th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street intersection is approximately 250-feet from the driveway;
therefore, it is not anticipated that the southbound movement would extend into the adjacent
intersection. The Simtraffic queuing output is provided in Appendix C.


Safety
No safety issues were identified within the site vicinity for existing roadway conditions.
Moreover, along NE 90th Street between Willows Road and 154th Avenue NE where 1
collision per million miles travelled was calculated no specific pattern of safety issues was
identified. As traffic volumes increase, the potential for vehicle conflicts could increases. The
increase in traffic as a result of the proposed project is anticipated to be relatively small with
intersection volumes increasing by 1 to 2 percent during the weekday PM peak hour. In
addition, it is not anticipated the small increase in traffic (3 project trips in the westbound
direction and 4 trips in the eastbound direction) along NE 90th Street between Willows Road
and 154th Avenue NE would exacerbate safety issues along this corridor.


Parking
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, code requirements, and
anticipated peak parking demand.
Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided within a surface lot with a total of 74
stalls.

Code Requirement
As described for existing conditions, the site is zoned MP and requires a minimum of 2
spaces per 1,000 square-feet GFA with a maximum allowable of 3 spaces per 1,000 square-
feet GFA. Table 7 provides a summary of the code required parking for the different
components of the proposed project.

 The 95th-percentile queue is defined to be the queue length that has only a 5-percent probability of being exceeded
during the analysis time period.

1. Based on City of Redmond Zoning Code for Zone MP, RZC 21.14.040.
2. Parking would be shared between all site uses.


The proposed parking supply of 74 spaces meets the City’s minimum requirements and does
not exceed the maximum allowed.

Demand
Peak parking demand would occur during weekday when a Food Bank occurs. During this
period, there are more customers served and typically there is more driving to the site since
the customers are receiving boxes of food.

Hopelink schedules appointments for both Food Bank and Client Services. The number of
appointments are staggered and the total time is limited. In addition, Hopelink does many of
their Client Service appointments off-site. If necessary, Hopelink is in the practice of
scheduling appointments to minimize parking demands by expanding service hours.

Parking demand was reviewed programmatically for the different components of the project.
          Food Bank/Client Services: During periods with a Food Bank and Client Services,
           Hopelink has a maximum of 15 appointments every 30 minutes for a total of 30
           appointments in a 60-minute period. Assuming all customers drive the maximum
           parking demand for Client Services/Food Bank would be 30 vehicles. Staff and
           volunteers would also be on-site to support the Food Bank and Client Services. The
           Redmond Hopelink would have one staff member and up to 4 volunteers, which
           equates to 5 vehicles assuming everyone drives alone. The total parking demand for
           the Food Bank/Clients Services would be 35 vehicles. This is conservative since it is
           not uncommon to have volunteers and customers carpool to the site and there are
           alternative modes available within the vicinity.
          Administrative Office: Parking demand for the Administrative Office was based on
           ITE Parking Generation, 4th Edition. ITE shows an average peak parking demand of
           2.47 vehicles per 1,000 square-feet for single tenant office use (LU #701). Based on
           the proposed 14,130 square-feet of Administrative Office, the peak parking demand
           would be 36 vehicles for the proposed office use.

The total peak parking demand for the site is anticipated to be 71 vehicles; therefore, the
proposed parking supply of 74 spaces would be adequate. As discussed previously, this
analysis is conservative since it does not consider potential carpool of customers and
volunteers as well as use of other available modes to access the site.

Sight Distance
Intersection and stopping sight distance was measured at the proposed driveway location
consistent with City standards. The sight distance standards applied to the driveway reflect
no grade along 154th Avenue NE as measured in the field. Requirements for sight distance
are outlined in the City of Redmond’s Zoning Code RZC 21.52.040.

Stopping sight distance is the distance a driver needs to see in order to come to a complete
stop after recognizing an object in the roadway. Intersection sight distance is the distance a
driver needs to see in order to safely enter an intersection from a stopped position. The
required and measured sight distances are shown in Table 8.

1.   Based on City of Redmond’s Zoning Code RZC 21.52.040 and application of the calculated 85th-percentile speeds.


As shown in Table 8, the stopping and intersection sight distance for the driveway along
154th Avenue NE were measured to be approximately 200 feet looking north and 1,000 feet
looking south. Sight distance to the north was measured to the intersection of NE 90th
Street/154th Avenue NE (200-feet) and to the intersection of NE 85th Street/154th Avenue
NE (1,000-feet). The measured sight distance meets City standards.

Transportation Impact Analysis
Phase Two Traffic Study: Hopelink Redmond Integrated Service Center                 November 2016



             Summary of Analysis and Mitigation
Summary of Impacts
This transportation impact study summarizes the project traffic impacts of the proposed
Hopelink Redmond Integrated Services Center. General findings include:
          The Hopelink Redmond Integrated Services Center would develop a service center
           totaling 27,860 square-feet including Client/Emergency Service Offices,
           Administrative Offices, associated conference and meeting space, and a Food
           Bank/Food Bank Storage Area.
          Based on a site specific data, the project would generate approximately 45 net new
           PM peak hour trips with 25 trips inbound and 20 trips outbound while the Food
           Bank is in operation. Without the Food Bank in operation, the project would typically
           generate approximately 24 net new weekday PM peak hour trips with 10 trips
           inbound and 14 trips outbound.
          Project traffic would represent about 1 to 2 percent of the 2018 PM peak hour traffic
           volumes at study intersections, which is within the daily fluctuation of traffic.
          Two intersections: Willows Road/NE 90th Street and 160th Avenue NE/NE 90th
           Street operate at LOS E or worse during the weekday PM peak hour under both
           future without and with-project conditions. The proposal is not anticipated to
           increase delay at these intersections.
          The proposed parking supply of 74 spaces meets the City’s minimum and
           maximum requirements, and the anticipated peak parking demand would be
           accommodated on-site.


Mitigation Measures
The resulting transportation-related impacts would not require implementation of project
specific mitigation measures based on the City of Redmond standards. The project would be
required to implement a Transportation Management Program for the site to manage site
access, availability of parking for employees and visitors to the site, and to reduce the level of
traffic generation during weekday morning and afternoon peak travel hours. Appendix E
shows the executed Transportation Management Program for the project.

In addition, the proponent would be required to pay the City of Redmond transportation
impact fees to mitigate general transportation-related project impacts throughout the City.
Table 9 shows the preliminary fee estimate for the proposed project based on the currently
adopted impact fee rate (effective 1/1/2016). These fees are provided as estimates only and
would be finalized by the City upon review. The preliminary fee estimate for the proposed
project is $162,413.

Review of Potential Improvements
In addition to the mitigation measures noted above, the City requested that as part of the
transportation study potential improvements be explored for the study intersections. It is not
anticipated that these improvements would be implemented as part of the proposed project;
however, this provides the City with a baseline evaluation of potential future 2018 with-project
weekday PM peak hour LOS and planning level cost estimates. The cost estimates include
construction, design, utilities, and right-of-way as appropriate and should be considered
preliminary. The potential improvements and resulting operations are summarized below. The
analysis assumes signal timing would be optimized with implementation of the improvements.

          Willows Road/NE 90th Street: Two potential improvements were reviewed at this
           location.
                       The first improvement considered adding a second northbound through lane
                        approaching the intersection, which is estimated to cost approximately
                        $640,000. A review of 2018 with-project conditions shows that with this
                        improvement the intersection would operate at LOS D during the weekday
                        PM peak hour.
                       The second improvement considered converting the southbound and
                        northbound left-turn movements from protected to protected-permitted by
                        providing a flashing yellow arrow. The signal upgrades are estimated to cost
                        approximately $40,000. Implementation of this improvement results in LOS D
                        operations during the weekday PM peak hour under 2018 with-project
                        conditions.

          160th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street: Consideration was given to adding a second
           westbound through lane approaching the intersection. This improvement was
           estimated to cost $730,000. With the additional lane, this intersection would operate
           at LOS C during the weekday PM peak hour under 2018 with project conditions.

          154th Avenue NE/NE 90th Street: Consideration was given to the conversion of
           the westbound left-turn movement from protected to protected-permitted by providing
           a flashing yellow arrow. The signal upgrades are estimated to cost approximately
           $40,000. This intersection would continue to operate at LOS C during the weekday
           PM peak hour under 2018 with project conditions and overall delay would decrease
           by approximately 2 seconds per vehicle. In addition, the northbound left-turn queue




                                                              23

         would continue to extend beyond the driveway even with a flashing yellow (see

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
