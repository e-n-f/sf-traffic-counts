Transportation Impact Analysis
1001 James Street                                                                    December 2015



                                    Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential transportation-
related impacts to the surrounding street network associated with the development of the
proposed 1001 James Street project in the First Hill neighborhood and Urban Center Village
of Seattle.


Project Description
The 1001 James Street project is located on the block bounded by Terry Avenue on the
southwest, James Street on the northwest, Boren Avenue on the northeast, and Jefferson
Street on the southeast in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle. The existing site is currently
occupied by a four-story apartment building, an office building, and their respective parking
lots. The site vicinity around the project study area is shown in Figure 1.

The proposed project would remove the existing on-site uses and develop a multifamily
residential building that includes up to 340 apartment units and 5,380 square-feet of retail
space in an 8-story building. Vehicle parking will be provided on-site and will include
approximately 283 vehicle parking stalls and 71 long-term bicycle storage spaces. Access to
the parking garage will be provided on the east side of Terry Avenue between James Street
and Jefferson Street. A preliminary site plan for the development is shown in Figure 2. The
proposed project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018 which will be used as
the horizon study year in this report’s analyses.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis is based on coordination with City of Seattle Department of
Planning and Development (DPD) staff. Based on anticipated travel patterns for project-
generated vehicle traffic, six off-site intersections as well as the garage access on Terry
Avenue were selected for study:

    1.   6th Avenue / James Street (signalized)
    2.   7th Avenue / James Street (signalized)
    3.   Terry Avenue / James Street (side-street stop-controlled)
    4.   Boren Avenue / James Street (signalized)
    5.   Terry Avenue / Jefferson Street (side-street stop-controlled)
    6.   Jefferson Street / Boren Avenue (signalized)

In addition to an evaluation of these individual intersections, a corridor-level evaluation of
travel times/speeds along the James Street corridor from 6th Avenue to Boren Avenue was
also completed.

Consistent with City requirements for this project, the study focuses on the weekday PM peak
hour. The analysis includes a review of existing conditions in the vicinity of the project site,
including the street network, existing and future without-project peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future with-
project conditions are evaluated by adding site-generated traffic to future without-project
volumes and were then compared to future without-project conditions to identify the relative
impacts the proposed project has on the surrounding transportation system.

1.   Terry Avenue is a designated Green Street (SMC 23.415.516 Map A) between Jefferson Street and Spring Street.



Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015-2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), one City project is anticipated to be complete before the project’s horizon year: the
First Hill Streetcar.

The First Hill Streetcar project will construct a modern streetcar system that will provide a
connection from Central Link Light Rail to residential and commercial areas in First Hill and
Capitol Hill to the University Link light rail line. The streetcar will run along Broadway Avenue,
two blocks from the proposed development, and will include a stop on Terrace Street one
block south of Jefferson Street. Construction of the streetcar line will alter the roadway
configuration to provide a street that is intended to balance transit, pedestrian, bicycle, and
vehicles demand in the area. The streetcar is anticipated to begin providing passenger
service later this year.


Vehicle Traffic Volumes
The following sections document the development of the traffic volumes used in the existing
and future without-project operations analyses.




                                                                                                                         Page 4
Transportation Impact Analysis

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes are based on recent weekday PM peak period (4:00 to 6:00 PM)
traffic counts conducted at each of the project’s study intersections. The highest peak hour
along the corridor during the peak period was used to develop the existing PM peak hour
traffic counts and occurred from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. Traffic volumes at some intersections were
adjusted and balanced with adjacent intersections based on the fluctuation in traffic observed
between the multiple count days. Existing PM peak period traffic count worksheets are shown
in Appendix A and existing traffic volumes that are rounded to the nearest five vehicles to
account for daily fluctuations are shown in Figure 3. At the intersection of Terry Avenue /
James Street, the left-turn and through movements are prohibited on the north and south legs
of Terry Avenue. Similarly, the left-turn is prohibited for north-to-west movements from Boren
Avenue to Jefferson Street. However, during the observation of existing counts, vehicles
were observed making these movements and are shown in Figure 3.

Pipeline Projects
Based on a review of planned developments on the Seattle Planning & Development website,
four planned development projects were identified in the study area. These “pipeline projects”
have been approved or are in the approval process but have yet to be constructed. These
projects include:

        1050 James St: Construction of a 74 unit residential building.

        550 Broadway: Construction of a mixed use building with 202 residential units and
         5,000 square feet of commercial space.

        710 Cherry St: Construction of a 79 residential unit building.

        800 Columbia St: Construction of a 287 residential unit building.

        Yesler Terrace: Project trips scaled to 2018 conditions using existing (2011) and
         future (2030) conditions from the Yesler Terrace Redevelopment Final Environmental
         Impact Statement, April 2011.

The anticipated distribution and assignment of project generated trips was obtained from
each projects’ traffic consultant for the TIA or assumed to be similar to 1001 James Street’s
distribution and were used to develop the horizon year, without-project traffic volumes.

Future Without-Project Volumes
Future without-project traffic volumes are comprised of the existing traffic volumes,
background traffic growth, and traffic generated from the planned “pipeline” developments.
An annual growth rate of 1.5 percent was applied to existing study intersection traffic volumes
to estimate 2018 horizon year background traffic growth. Traffic from the pipeline projects in
the vicinity listed in the previous section were also added. Forecast future without-project
traffic volumes for the future horizon year are shown in Figure 4.

Vehicular Traffic Operations
The following sections summarize traffic operations for existing and future conditions for
individual intersections as well as the James Street corridor.

Intersection Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). At signalized intersections, LOS is measured in average
control delay per vehicle and is typically reported using the intersection delay and volume-to-
capacity ratio (V/C). At unsignalized side-street, stop-controlled intersections, LOS is
measured by the average delay on the worst-movement of the intersection. Traffic operations
and average vehicle delay for an intersection can be described qualitatively with a range of
levels of service (LOS A through LOS F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F
indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

For the operations analysis of existing conditions at the signalized study intersections, signal
timing and phasing information was obtained from the Seattle Department of Transportation
(SDOT). Analysis parameters such as lane channelization and traffic signal settings were
maintained for future (2018) without-project conditions from existing conditions, with some
minor changes. These changes to green times and offsets at one intersection were made to
reflect changes likely to be made by City staff resulting from future changes in travel patterns
and traffic volumes. This helps to identify the potential change in average vehicle delay and
LOS attributed to increases from anticipated background growth and in-process projects.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (2010), and were evaluated using Synchro 9. Synchro 9 is a software
program that uses HCM methodology to evaluate intersection LOS and average vehicle
delays. Results for the existing and future without-project operations analyses are
summarized in Table 2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis are included
in Appendix C.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections but instead focuses on the incremental delay at LOS E and F intersection for
determining whether an impact is potentially significant or not.

As shown in Table 2, during the existing weekday PM peak hour, all intersections currently
operate at LOS D or better during the existing weekday PM peak hour. When future pipeline
project volumes and background growth are added to the existing traffic volumes, the study

intersections continue to operate at the same LOS with minimal increases in delay under
existing conditions during the weekday PM peak hour in 2018.

Corridor Operations
Corridor travel times/speeds along James Street between 6th Avenue and Boren Avenue
were evaluated using the Synchro9 network used for the intersection operations analysis and
observed travel times/speeds collected in November 2015. Signalized intersections along this
corridor not evaluated in the previous section were added to the Synchro9 network and
existing traffic volumes collected at these intersections from a variety of sources included for
this corridor evaluation and balanced with the individual study intersections described in the
previous section. Appendix F provides a summary of the existing balanced traffic volumes for
all intersections along this corridor segment as well as detailed traffic count data for the
additional intersections.

Travel time projections and average speeds reported from the Synchro model were calibrated
to data measured in the field. Table 3 provides a summary of the existing travel times
measured in the field, existing uncalibrated travel times from the Synchro model, and the
resulting adjustment factor. The adjustment or calibration factor accounts for operational
impacts from vehicle queuing, mid-block pedestrian crossing, on-street parking maneuvers,
etc. not reflected in the Synchro delay calculations. The future travel times from the Synchro
model are multiplied by the adjustment factor to determine future travel times calibrated to
field conditions and accounting for the factors described above (i.e., queuing, parking, etc.).

As shown, during the weekday PM peak hour the field data shows that travel times along
James Street within the defined segment from 6th Avenue to Boren is approximately two
minutes eastbound and over four minutes westbound. These average travel speeds take into
account free-flow travel times and intersection related delay. Overall the travel times and
speeds indicate existing congestion in both directions, but particularly so in the westbound
direction. With the addition of further traffic growth, westbound travel times would increase

negligible and indicates little change in the eastbound operations.


Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from the Seattle Department of
Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. A

The SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The most
recent review was completed in 2014 and screens locations for the previous year (in this
case 2013). As defined by SDOT’s annual High Collision Location Review, locations are
identified as a HCL at signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a year,
unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, mid-block locations with 10 or more
collisions a year, and locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions.

As shown in Table 5, 6th Avenue/James Street and the segment of James St between 6th
and 7th Ave are considered HCL’s averaging over 10 annual collisions. James St/Terry Ave
is also deemed a HCL with more than 5 annual collisions for an unsignalized intersection.

For 6th Ave / James St, the majority of the 39 total collisions involved left-turn collisions (21),
followed by angled collisions (7) and sideswipe (3). There were no fatalities although there
were 16 reported injury collisions. There were no bicycle related collisions and only one
pedestrian related collision at this location.

At the Terry Ave / James St, the most common type of collision out of the 16 total collisions
involved angled (7), followed by left-turns (3). There were no fatalities and 12 reported injury

this location. Both pedestrian related collisions involved a vehicle going straight striking a
pedestrian crossing the street.

For the segment of James Street between 6th and 7th Avenue, the most common type of

Transit
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro. The proposed project is
very well-served by transit. Within the study area Jefferson Street is considered a major
transit street and Boren Avenue is classified as a minor transit street. The nearest bus lines
to the proposed project are located adjacent to the project site along Boren Avenue, James
Street, and Jefferson Street. The nearest transit stop is located at Boren Avenue and James
Street and provides access to weekday commuter routes 64, 303, 309, and 630. The site is
also near many local bus routes that provide daily, high-frequency transit service to
neighborhoods throughout Seattle. Local transit routes serving stops within one-quarter mile
of the project site are summarized in Table 6.

In addition to the metro routes serving the site, the First Hill Streetcar located on Broadway
will be providing passenger service later this year. The First Hill Streetcar will be an important
link in the regional transit system, with connections to Link Light Rail at the Capitol Hill Station
and International District Station, as well as Sounder Commuter Rail and Amtrak intercity rail
at King Street Station. The Streetcar is planned to run between 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on

Pedestrians
Pedestrian facilities consist primarily of sidewalks along both sides of the streets within the
study area. Each of the study intersections include sidewalk curb ramps, marked crosswalks,
and pedestrian signal heads at the signalized intersections. The area currently has high
pedestrian activity due to the various office, institutional and residential land uses nearby.
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015-2020 Adopted CIP and Pedestrian Master
Plan, neighborhood greenway improvements are planned along Terry Avenue in 2017 within
the immediate vicinity of the proposed project site.

Pedestrian activity along the project frontages were also reviewed for later consideration of
potential driveway impacts. Weekday AM and PM peak period pedestrian counts were
conducted along all four sidewalks bordering the project site in July 2015 with detailed
worksheets provided in Appendix H. Future without-project pedestrian volumes are
anticipated to increase at a similar but greater rate than vehicular volumes in the project
vicinity. Vehicular traffic volumes are anticipated to increase between 2.5 percent and
7.5 percent in total from existing to future (2018) without-project conditions at the study
intersections. Based on this, future pedestrian volumes along the project frontage were
conservatively assumed to increase at the higher total growth of 7.5 percent forecast at the
Terry Avenue/James Street intersection to 2018 conditions. Existing pedestrian volumes are
summarized in Table 7 with detailed count data provided in Appendix A. Forecast pedestrian
volumes are also summarized in Table 7.

     highest vehicular growth of 7.5 percent from 2015 to forecast 2018 conditions and was assumed equal to the pedestrian growth
     within the project vicinity.


As shown, pedestrian volumes along the project frontage are and expected to remain lowest
along Terry Avenue at approximately 55 pedestrians per hour or less under future conditions,
and up to 120 pedestrians per hour along Jefferson Street.

Bicycles
Jefferson Street contains shared lane markings (sharrows) for bicyclists traveling to
Downtown Seattle or South Seattle from First Hill. On 9th Avenue, from Spruce Street to
Jefferson Street, there is an in-street bike lane on the east side and sharrows on the west
side. North of Jefferson Street, 9th Avenue has sharrows on both sides of the street.
Broadway contains a two-way cycle track from E Yesler Way to E Howell Street.

Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015-2020 Adopted CIP, and 2015-2019 Seattle
Bicycle Master Plan – Implementation Plan, neighborhood greenway improvements are
planned along Terry Avenue in 2017 within the immediate vicinity of the proposed project
site. However, specific design details are not yet available.

                                      Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street network and study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated by the
proposed site are distributed and assigned to adjacent streets and intersections within the
study area for the weekday PM peak hour study period. Next, project trips are added to future
without-project traffic volumes and any potential impact to traffic operations, safety, non-
motorized facilities, and transit are identified. Site specific items are also discussed such as
the operation of the site’s access driveway and estimated on-site parking demand of the
proposed project’s land uses.


Vehicle Trip Generation
Project trip generation was estimated based on a widely accepted urban development
practice of calculating person trips and then estimating the portion of the person trips that
would be vehicle, bicycle, walking, or transit trips. Most Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and may over predict the number of
vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit. Therefore, the trip generation in this
analysis considers the use of alternative modes. The number of overall vehicle trips
generated was determined by calculating total person trips in the weekday daily, AM, and PM
peak hour conditions and then separating the person trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto,

Person trips were developed based on trip rates and average vehicle occupancy information
from ITE’s Trip Generation (9th Edition) and NCHRP 365. Person trips using each
transportation mode were determined by multiplying the total person trips by the estimated
mode splits from 2009 – 2013 American Community Survey’s Selected Economic
Characteristics data for the project’s location (Census Tract #85). The First Hill neighborhood
is well-served by transit, has low vehicle ownership rates and is close to many employment

centers in the First Hill and Downtown Seattle neighborhoods which allows residents take
many walking and biking trips. The trip generation of the existing land uses on site were
developed using the same method that was used for the proposed use. The existing trip
generation was subtracted from the trip generation for the proposed project to determine the
number of net new trips associated with the new multifamily development.

Table 8 provides a summary of the trip generation for the proposed land uses. A detailed
summary of the trip generation calculations for these uses has been provided in Appendix D.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in Table 8, the development is anticipated to generate approximately 400 new
vehicle trips daily with approximately 29 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 32
new vehicle trips during the typical weekday PM peak hour.


Vehicle Trip Distribution & Assignment
Trip distribution patterns to and from the project site were based on existing vehicle travel
patterns, previous studies in the project vicinity, and U.S. Census Bureau’s OnTheMap tool.
OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more
likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive. As the majority of local project trips
around First Hill are anticipated to use transit or non-motorized methods to and from the site,
vehicle trips are anticipated to be longer in duration and likely directed to and from the
freeways in the area. The project trip distribution for vehicle trips is shown in Figure 5.

The anticipated weekday PM peak hour net new vehicle trip generation was assigned to the
street network and the study intersections based on the distribution patterns described above
and shown in Figure 5. At the site access, the gross trip generation was assigned to the
access garage as this is a new driveway that will accommodate all project traffic.

Vehicle Traffic Volume Impact
The assigned project generated traffic was added to the future without-project weekday PM
peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections. The resulting 2018 with-project traffic
volumes are shown in Figure 6. Table 9 summarizes the percent increase of traffic volumes
at the study intersections that are attributable to the anticipated trip generation of the
proposed project during the weekday PM peak hour.

As shown in Table 9, the proposed project is anticipated to account less than 2.0 percent of
the total weekday PM peak hour traffic at the off-site study intersections. Traffic volumes
typically fluctuate day-to-day by five to ten percent depending on factors such as the day of
the week, weather conditions, and traffic conditions elsewhere in the surrounding street
network. This increase in traffic volumes related to project traffic falls within these normal
fluctuations and will likely go unnoticed by the majority of roadway users in the study area.


Vehicle Traffic Operations Impact
The following sections summarize traffic operations for existing and future conditions for
individual intersections as well as the James Street corridor.

Intersection Operations
A future with-project level-of-service analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour
to analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methodologies were applied and
all intersection parameters such as channelization and intersection control were consistent
with those used in the evaluation of future without-project conditions. No signal timings were
changed from future without-project conditions for the operations analysis in order to show
the incremental impact of adding the project traffic to the study intersections. A comparison of
horizon year 2018 future without-project and future with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic
operations are summarized in Table 10 (page 18). Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in
Appendix C.

With the addition of project generated traffic during the weekday PM peak hour study period,
all study intersections would continue to operate acceptably under the same LOS as without-
project conditions with only minor increases (approximately 1 second or less) in delay
occurring. All study intersections are anticipated to continue to operate at LOS D or better
during future with-project conditions.

Corridor Operations
Corridor travel times/speeds along James Street between 6th Avenue and Boren Avenue
were evaluated with the addition of project generated traffic, consistent with the previously
described methodology for existing a future without-project conditions. This includes the
application of the adjustment factors previously described.

Table 11 summarizes the existing and forecast 2018 corridor LOS and travel times/speeds.
Detailed corridor operations worksheets are provided in Appendix G.

As shown, the addition of project generated traffic along the corridor is anticipated to add
minimal delay along the corridor and does not result in any significant change to the forecast
average travel speed.


Site Access
The following sections described the proposed site access as well as an alternative access
location on Jefferson Street and considers pedestrian volumes along the project frontage,
available sight-lines between pedestrians and project generated vehicles, and potential
impacts to transit.

Proposed Access
As shown in the preliminary site plan (Figure 2), access to the on-site parking garage is
proposed on the east side of Terry Avenue between James Street and Jefferson Street. Terry




                                                                                                                  Page 18

Avenue is classified as a local access roadway1 which has the lowest peak hour vehicle
volumes and is the lowest classification roadway adjacent to the project. The access will
ramp downward to the below-grade parking garage that will be used by residential tenants.
Traffic accessing the site was assigned based on the project’s anticipated trip distribution and
turn restrictions at Terry Avenue / James Street and Boren Avenue / Jefferson Street.

As previously described and as shown in Figure 7, pedestrian volumes without the project are
anticipated to be lowest along Terry Avenue along the project frontage. The proposed project
is anticipated to generate approximately 90 AM peak hour pedestrian trips and 110 during the
PM peak hour as shown in the detailed trip generation worksheets in Appendix D.




                     Figure 7. Weekday Peak Hour Pedestrian Volumes
As shown, pedestrian access to the proposed project would be provided on the northwest
and southeast corners of the project site. Most pedestrian destinations such as transit
facilities or retail within the project vicinity are located either north, east, or south of the
project site. Most site generated pedestrian traffic is expected to travel along James Street or
Jefferson Street with less using Terry Avenue or Boren Avenue. Although future with-project
pedestrian volumes are not shown, the greatest combined pedestrian activity along the
project frontage is anticipated to continue to occur along Jefferson Street and the lowest
activity along Terry Avenue or Boren Avenue based on these likely pedestrian patterns
activity.

Site access operations at the garage entrance with Terry Avenue were analyzed under 2018
weekday PM peak hour conditions (including the total trip generation to and from the site),
using the same methodology described for the off-site study intersection analysis. It is
anticipated that during the weekday PM peak hour, the site access would operate at LOS A
with approximately 10 seconds or less of delay for vehicles leaving the garage (westbound
approach). Due to the relatively low traffic volumes entering and exiting the garage as well as
minimal through traffic that currently exists on Terry Avenue between James Street and
Jefferson Street, vehicle queues are expected to be minimal (one vehicle or less) at the site
access. The LOS worksheet for the site access analysis is included in Appendix C.

Based on the anticipated pedestrian activity along the project frontage and estimated project
trip generation, conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles are lowest along Terry Avenue.

Alternative Jefferson Street Access
An alternative site access location is from Jefferson Street on the south edge of the project.
At the request of DPD staff, the following provides a review of that alternative. As will be
described, due to pedestrian volumes, transit activity, and sight lines and pedestrian impacts,
Terry Avenue represents a better access point.

As previously described in Table 7 (page 12), the greatest existing and future pedestrian
volumes along the project frontage occur along Jefferson Street with 110 AM peak hour and
120 PM peak hour pedestrians forecast under 2018 conditions. These volumes are
approximately double the volumes along Terry Avenue during both peak periods and indicate
pedestrians would be exposed to a greater number of driveway conflicts were the driveway
located on Jefferson Street than on Terry Avenue.

Sight triangles at a potential Jefferson Street driveway access were also evaluated and are
illustrated in Figure 10 and vertical sight lines are shown in Figure 11 (both on page 22). As
shown, required sight-triangles could be provided at a potential Jefferson Street access but
results in a smaller available sight-triangle because of the shorter building setback than the
proposed access onto Terry Avenue, demonstrating that access on Terry Avenue provides
better sight-lines between pedestrians and vehicles exiting the parking garage.

                Figure 11. Jefferson Street Access Vertical Driveway Profile
In addition to potential conflicts with pedestrians, access onto Jefferson Street would result in
greater potential conflicts between project generated traffic accessing the parking garage and
transit that currently operates along Jefferson . As previously described, King County Metro
operates bus routes along James Street, Boren Avenue, and Jefferson Street but does not
operate along Terry Avenue. With potential access onto Jefferson Street, all project traffic
turning to or from the potential driveway could delay transit operations . With the proposed
access onto Terry Avenue, only a portion of project generated traffic would impact Jefferson
Street bus operations (at Terry Avenue/Jefferson Street) but would result in a similar impact
to bus operations along James Street and Boren Avenue. Based on this, the proposed

access on Terry Avenue results in a smaller impact to transit operations than a potential
driveway on Jefferson Street.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Two screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that were
analyzed for concurrency review include South of S Jackson Street between 12th Avenue
South and Lakeside Avenue S (Screenline 10.12), and East of the CBD (Screenline 12.12),
as shown in Table 12. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated
traffic traveling in the direction from the proposed project in the direction of the screenlines
would extend across the screenlines included in this analysis.

                                                                         2008      Project   V/C Ratio      LOS

1.   SL# = Screenline Number
2.   Direction: NB = Northbound, SB = Southbound, EB = Eastbound, WB = Westbound


The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenlines would have volume-to-capacity ratios that are less than the City’s volume-to-
capacity threshold; thus, the proposed project would meet concurrency requirements.


Transit Impacts
The transit stops and routes located near the project site provide connections to existing
transit services for residents and visitors to the project site. Additionally, the First Hill streetcar
is anticipated to be operational by the horizon year of the project and will provide transit
service along Broadway throughout First Hill traveling north to Capitol Hill and south to the
Central District and the International District. The nearest planned stop for the First Hill
Streetcar is located on Broadway at Terrace Avenue which is approximately 600 feet (1/8
mile) from the project site. The streetcar will increase the transit access, frequency, and
reliability for tenants and patrons of the proposed development to Capitol Hill, Downtown
area, and Link light rail. Along with the existing extensive bus network, the site will continue to
be well connected to the region by transit.


Non-Motorized Impacts
Pedestrians and bicyclists are anticipated to account for a share of the trips generated by the
proposed project as the project is well served by both pedestrian and bicycle facilities. To
accommodate bicyclists, secure bicycle storage for 71 bikes will be provided on site. The
two-way cycle track that currently existing along Broadway provides a north-south connection
in East Seattle and connects to other local and regional bicycle routes.

Parking Analysis
An on-site parking analysis for the proposed development was completed. The following
sections describe the proposed parking supply and the estimated peak parking demand of
the project.

Parking Supply
The proposed project will provide a below-grade, on-site parking garage that will be used by
building tenants and will replace existing surface parking lots. The existing on-site lots
providing 132 total stalls are used by existing on-site apartment and office uses with the
majority (approximately 80 stalls) contracted for use by construction workers and vehicles
working on construction projects near the project site. Due to the number of stalls leased to
contractors in the area, minimal public parking demand would be displaced to other on and
off-street parking facilities in the vicinity of the project site.

As previously mentioned, the parking garage for the proposed project will be accessed by a
driveway on Terry Avenue between James Street and Jefferson Street. The garage is
proposed to provide approximately 283 parking stalls on-site. In addition, the proposed
project will also provide 71 long-term bicycle parking spaces.

Parking Demand
The peak parking demand for the apartment uses is expected to be below national averages
due to the project’s location in the First Hill Urban Center Village, proximity to frequent transit
service, and proximity to major employment centers in First Hill and Downtown Seattle. The
peak parking demand for the proposed residential units was estimated based on the most
current local vehicle ownership rate from US Census data.3 Based on the proposed mix of
apartment units, a combined parking demand rate of 0.48 vehicles per dwelling unit was
estimated for the development’s residents and residential visitors. In addition, the peak
parking demand for the retail use was estimated to be 3 vehicles. The detailed ownership
rate calculations are provided in Appendix E.

As shown in Table 13, conservatively assuming that the peak parking demand for residential
and retail uses peak at the same time of day, the project peak parking demand is expected to
be 167 vehicles and would be accommodated by the proposed 283 parking stalls. In addition,
a surplus of parking is provided to accommodate the existing displaced demand and
additional public parking demand in the vicinity of the project.

Parking Code Requirements
Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015 Table A and Table B, there are no minimum
parking requirements for multifamily uses located in urban centers. This project is located
within the First Hill Urban Center Village and thus, no minimum parking requirements apply to
the proposed development.

Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking is an important end of trip facility that is
important in promoting the use of bicycle travel to and from a site. Beyond the environmental
and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists reduce the traffic and parking
impacts of a development and support many City and Neighborhood comprehensive plan
goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is also important to keep sidewalks fully
ADA compliant and passable, and reduces the chances of bicycles obstructing emergency
escape routes.

Per SMC 23.54.015, bicycle parking is required to be provided by new developments. The
SMC requires secure, covered long-term bicycle parking for residential developments. Due to
the project’s Urban Center location and the anticipation that it will have fewer vehicle and
more non-motorized trips, the bicycle storage rate is higher. The bicycle parking requirements
for the site are shown in Table 14.

As shown in Table 14, the proposed development is required to provide 71 long-term bicycle
parking spaces and 1 short-term bicycle parking space. The current development plan will
provide 71 long-term bicycle parking spaces and at least one short-term bicycle space. It is
likely these spaces will be provided in the vehicle parking garage and be easily accessible
from the street.

1001 James Street                                                                      December 2015



                         Findings and Conclusions
This transportation impact analysis summarizes the project traffic impacts of the proposed
1001 James Street multifamily development project in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle.
General findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would develop up to 340 multifamily residential units that
           include a mix between one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments along with
           5,380 square feet of commercial use. This development would replace the existing
           multifamily residential, office building, and parking lots currently occupying the
           project site.
          The development would generate vehicular, walking, bicycling and transit trips. The
           development is anticipated to generate approximately 400 new vehicle trips daily
           with approximately 29 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 32 new
           vehicle trips during the typical weekday PM peak hour
          Project traffic would represent less than 2 percent of the 2018 weekday PM peak
           hour traffic volumes at the off-site study intersections. All off-site study intersections
           would operate at the same LOS D or better during the weekday PM peak hours
           under 2018 with-project conditions as 2018 without-project conditions. The addition
           of project generated traffic along the corridor is anticipated to add less than one
           second of delay along the corridor and does not result in any change to the forecast
           average travel speed.
          The access driveway to the proposed parking garage is on Terry Avenue between
           James Street and Jefferson Street. It is anticipated to operate at LOS A during the
           weekday PM peak hour and experience minimal queuing.
          An alternative access onto Jefferson Street showed would result in greater
           pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, provides less sight-distance between vehicles and
           pedestrians, and has a greater impact to traffic operations than providing access
           onto Terry Avenue.
          The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the
           project, the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City level of
           service thresholds; thus, the conditions would meet concurrency requirements.
          The proposed site is located next to frequent and reliable transit as well as near
           extensive pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The site is anticipated to have an
           approximate peak vehicle demand of 167 vehicles for the residential and retail
           uses. The garage will provide 283 parking stalls which will meet the vehicle parking
           demand. The project will provide 71 long-term bicycle parking spaces and at least
           one short-term bicycle parking space.

Appendix B:LOS Definitions
Highway Capacity Manual, 2010

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying
several intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time.
Specifically, LOS criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified
time period (for example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on
many variables, including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the
intersection), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity.
Table 1 shows LOS criteria for signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010).

    Service               (sec/veh)                (Signalized Intersections)

        B                   >10 - 20               Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                   >20 - 35               Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                          Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait
                            >35 - 55
                                                   through more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                   >55 - 80               Unstable flow (intolerable delay)
        F                      >80                 Forced flow (jammed)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types:
all-way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS
is expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of
a signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a
two-way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual
movements, rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-
controlled intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total
average vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized
intersections (both all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).
