Transportation Impact Analysis
707 Terry Avenue                                                                        October 2016



                                     Introduction
The purpose of this transportation impact analysis (TIA) is to identify potential transportation-
related impacts to the surrounding street network associated with the development of the
proposed 707 Terry Avenue project in the First Hill neighborhood and Urban Center Village of
Seattle.


Project Description
The 707 Terry Avenue project is located on the block bounded by Terry Avenue on the
northeast, Columbia Street on the northwest, Cherry Street to the southeast, and 9th Avenue
to the southwest in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle. The existing site is currently
occupied by a surface parking lot. The site vicinity around the project study area is shown in
Figure 1.

The proposed project would remove the existing surface parking lot and develop a multifamily
residential building that includes up to 486 apartment units and approximately 7,500 square-
feet of retail space. Vehicle parking will be provided on-site and will include approximately
319 vehicle parking stalls. Access to the parking garage will be provided via the alley
connecting to Columbia Street and Cherry Street. A preliminary site plan for the development
is shown in Figure 2. The proposed project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by
2019 which was used as the horizon study year for this analysis.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis is based on coordination with City of Seattle Department of
Planning and Development (DPD) staff. Based on anticipated travel patterns for project-
generated vehicle traffic, the following intersections were selected for study:

    1.   Boren Avenue/Madison Street
    2.   Terry Avenue/Columbia Street
    3.   9th Avenue/Cherry Street
    4.   7th Avenue/Cherry Street
    5.   6th Avenue/Cherry Street
    6.   9th Avenue/James Street
    7.   7th Avenue/James Street
    8.   6th Avenue/James Street

The alley intersections with Columbia Street and Cherry Street were also analyzed under
future (2019) with-project conditions. Consistent with City requirements, this study focuses on
the weekday PM peak hour. The analysis includes a review of existing conditions in the
vicinity of the project site, including the street network, existing and future without-project
peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit
service. Future (2019) with-project conditions are evaluated by adding site-generated traffic
to future (2019) without-project volumes and were then compared to future (2019) without-
project conditions to identify the relative impacts the proposed project has on the surrounding
transportation system.

1.   Terry Avenue is a designated Green Street (SMC 23.415.516 Map A) between Jefferson Street and Spring Street.



Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2016-2021 Proposed Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), one City project is anticipated to be completed before the project’s horizon year: the
Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).

The Madison Street BRT Study LPA Summary Report, December 2015 describes and
evaluates the preferred alternative for this project. The BRT will operate in Business Access
& Transit (BAT) lanes or exclusive transit lanes allowing for turn lanes, curb cuts and parking
from 1st Avenue to 6th Avenue and 15th Avenue to 18th Avenue along Madison Street.


Vehicle Traffic Volumes
The following sections document the development of the traffic volumes used in the existing
and future without-project operations analyses.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes are based on weekday PM peak period (4:00 to 6:00 PM) traffic
counts conducted at each of the project’s study intersections in October 2015 and February
2016. Existing PM peak period traffic count worksheets are shown in Appendix A and existing



                                                                                                                         Page 4

traffic volumes that are rounded to the nearest five vehicles to account for daily fluctuations
are shown in Figure 3.

Future Without-Project Volumes
Future (2019) without-project traffic volumes are comprised of the existing traffic volumes,
background traffic growth, and traffic generated from the planned “pipeline” developments.
An annual growth rate of 1.5 percent was applied to existing study intersection traffic volumes
to estimate 2019 horizon year background traffic growth. In addition to the growth rate, which
accounts for the background growth from pipeline project in the area, traffic from specific
pipeline projects in the vicinity were added to the future (2019) without-project traffic volumes
as a conservative estimate and to account for cumulative impacts. The pipeline project
included in the background growth are listed below. Forecast future without-project traffic
volumes for the future horizon year are shown in Figure 4.

Pipeline projects are based on a review of planned developments on the Seattle Department
of Construction & Inspections website and through coordination with City staff, 13 planned
development projects were identified in the study area. These “pipeline projects” account for
the cumulative impacts without the project and have been approved or are in the approval
process but have yet to be constructed. These projects include:

        1050 James St: Construction of a 74-unit residential building.

        550 Broadway: Construction of a mixed use building with 202 residential units and
         5,000 square feet of commercial space.

        710 Cherry St: Construction of a 79 residential unit building.

        800 Columbia St: Construction of a 287 residential unit building.

        Yesler Terrace: Project trips scaled to 2018 conditions using existing (2011) and
         future (2030) conditions from the Yesler Terrace Redevelopment Final Environmental
         Impact Statement, April 2011.

        1001 James Street: Development of a 340-unit apartment building with approximately
         5,380 square feet of retail.

        Swedish First Hill: Projects trips for future (2020) conditions from the Swedish Medical
         Center First Hill Campus Block 95 Tower and Northwest Tower, January 2016.

        620 Terry Avenue: Construction of a 23-story senior housing building including
         approximately 237 residential units.

        Virginia Mason Medical Center: This project would develop an additional 1.7 million
         square feet of planned and potential building space. The MIMP for the medical center
         has a horizon of 2042; this analysis assumes approximately 26 percent of the
         development would be completed by 2019.

        Seattle University Campus MIMP: This project would develop an additional 2.3 acres of
         building area. The MIMP has a horizon of 2028; this analysis assumes approximately 55
         percent of the development would be completed by 2019.

        500 Terry Avenue: This project would develop 328 multifamily residential units.

        423 Terry Avenue: This project includes development of a congregate residence with
         approximately 71 sleeping units and 44 small efficiency dwelling units.

        515 Minor Avenue: Construction of approximately 133,000 square feet of medical office
         building.

The anticipated distribution and assignment of project generated trips was obtained from
each projects’ traffic consultant for the TIA or assumed to be similar to 707 Terry Avenue’s
distribution and were used to develop the horizon year, without-project traffic volumes.

Vehicular Traffic Operations
The following sections summarize traffic operations for existing and future conditions for
individual study intersections.

Intersection Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). At signalized intersections, LOS is measured in average
control delay per vehicle and is typically reported using the intersection delay and volume-to-
capacity ratio (V/C). At unsignalized side-street, stop-controlled intersections, LOS is
measured by the average delay on the worst-movement of the intersection. Traffic operations
and average vehicle delay for an intersection can be described qualitatively with a range of
levels of service (LOS A through LOS F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F
indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

For the operations analysis of existing conditions at the signalized study intersections, signal
timing and phasing information was obtained from the Seattle Department of Transportation
(SDOT). Analysis parameters such as lane channelization and traffic signal settings were
maintained for future (2019) without-project conditions from existing conditions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (2010), and were evaluated using Synchro 9. Synchro 9 is a software
program that uses HCM methodology to evaluate intersection LOS and average vehicle
delays. Results for the existing and future without-project operations analyses are
summarized in Table 2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis are included
in Appendix C.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections but instead focuses on the incremental delay at LOS E and F intersection for
determining whether an impact is potentially significant or not.

As shown in Table 2, during the existing weekday PM peak hour, all intersections currently
operate at LOS D or better with the exception of the 9th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection.
The 9th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection currently operates at LOS F. When future pipeline
project volumes and background growth are added to the existing traffic volumes, the study
intersections continue to operate at the same LOS with minimal increases in delay under

intersections. The 7th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS
B to LOS C, the 9th Avenue/James Street intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS C
to LOS D, and the 7th Avenue/James Street intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS
D to LOS F under future (2019) without-project conditions.

Corridor Operations
Corridor travel times/speeds along James Street between 6th Avenue and Broadway were
evaluated using the Synchro 9 network used for the intersection operations analysis and
observed travel times/speeds collected in November 2015. Signalized intersections along this
corridor not evaluated in the previous section were added to the Synchro 9 network and
existing traffic volumes collected at these intersections from a variety of sources included for
this corridor evaluation and balanced with the individual study intersections described in the
previous section. Appendix F provides a summary of the existing balanced traffic volumes for
all intersections along this corridor segment as well as detailed traffic count data for the
additional intersections.

Travel time projections and average speeds reported from the Synchro model were calibrated
to data measured in the field. Table 3 provides a summary of the existing travel times
measured in the field, existing uncalibrated travel times from the Synchro model, and the
resulting adjustment factor. The adjustment or calibration factor accounts for operational
impacts from vehicle queuing, mid-block pedestrian crossing, on-street parking maneuvers,
etc. not reflected in the Synchro delay calculations. The future travel times from the Synchro
model are multiplied by the adjustment factor to determine future travel times calibrated to
field conditions and accounting for the factors described above (i.e., queuing, parking, etc.).

into account free-flow travel times and intersection related delay. Overall the travel times and
speeds indicate existing congestion in both directions, but particularly so in the westbound
direction. With the addition of further traffic growth, both eastbound and westbound travel
times would increase and travel speeds would decrease.


Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from the Seattle Department of
Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. A
summary of the total and average annual number of reported accidents at each study
intersection and along the roadway segments adjacent to the proposed project is provided

As shown in Table 5, the 6th Avenue/Cherry Street and 6th Avenue/James Street
intersections and the segment of James Street between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue
averaged over 10 annual collisions.

At the 6th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection right angle collisions were the primary type of
collision that occurred (21 collisions) and left-turn related (7 collisions). Of the reported
collisions, 2 involved pedestrians, and no bicycle collisions or fatalities.

For 6th Avenue/James Street intersection, the majority of the 35 total collisions involved left-
turn collisions (20 collisions), followed by angled collisions (8 collisions) and sideswipe (3
collisions). There were no fatalities although there were 16 reported injury collisions. There
were no bicycle related collisions and only one pedestrian related collision at this location.

For the segment of James Street between 6th and 7th Avenue, the most common type of
collision out of the 35 total collisions involved rear-ends (19 collisions), followed by
sideswipes (5 collisions). There were no fatalities and 7 reported injury collisions. There were
no bicycle or pedestrian related collisions.

Additionally, in the study area, there was one reported fatality at the 9th Avenue/James Street
intersection. The collision occurred in 2014 during dry daylight conditions and involved a
vehicle striking a pedestrian.

The SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The most
recent review was completed in 2015 and screens locations for the previous year (in this
case 2014). As defined by SDOT’s annual High Collision Location Review, locations are
identified as a HCL at signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a year,
unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, mid-block locations with 10 or more
collisions a year, and locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions.

In the study area SDOT has identified the 6th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection and the
James Street corridor between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue as HCLs.


Transit
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro. The proposed project is
very well-served by transit. Within the study area Jefferson Street is considered a major
transit street and Boren Avenue is classified as a minor transit street. The nearest bus lines
to the proposed project are located along Boren Avenue between Columbia Street and
Cherry Street approximately 0.1 miles away or a 2 to 3-minute walk. Additional Stops are
located along 9th Avenue. Local transit routes serving stops within one-quarter mile of the
project site are summarized in Table 6.

1. Headways in minutes during weekday AM and PM Peak periods.


In addition to the metro routes serving the site, the First Hill Streetcar provides connections to
Link Light Rail at the Capitol Hill Station and International District Station, as well as King
Street Station. The Streetcar is planned to run between 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on weekdays,
6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Saturdays, and between 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sundays.
Weekday headways will be between 10 to 25 minutes during its hours of operations.

Pedestrians
Pedestrian facilities consist primarily of sidewalks along both sides of the streets within the
study area. Each of the study intersections include sidewalk curb ramps, marked crosswalks
(on at least one leg of the intersection), and pedestrian signal heads at the signalized
intersections. The area currently has high pedestrian activity due to the various office,
institutional, and residential land uses nearby. Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015-
2020 Adopted CIP and Pedestrian Master Plan, neighborhood greenway improvements are
planned along Terry Avenue in 2017 within the immediate vicinity of the proposed project
site.

Bicycles
On 9th Avenue, from Spruce Street to Jefferson Street, there is an in-street bike lane on the
east side and sharrows on the west side. North of Jefferson Street, 9th Avenue has sharrows
on both sides of the street. Broadway contains a two-way cycle track from E Yesler Way to E
Howell Street.

Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015-2020 Adopted CIP, and 2015-2019 Seattle
Bicycle Master Plan – Implementation Plan, neighborhood greenway improvements are
planned along Terry Avenue in 2017 within the immediate vicinity of the proposed project
site. However, specific design details are not yet available.

                                 Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street network and study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated by the
proposed site are distributed and assigned to adjacent streets and intersections within the
study area for the weekday PM peak hour study period. Next, project trips are added to future
without-project traffic volumes and any potential impact to traffic operations, safety, non-
motorized facilities, and transit are identified. Site specific items are also discussed such as
the operation of the site’s access driveway and estimated on-site parking demand of the
proposed project’s land uses.


Vehicle Trip Generation
Project trip generation was estimated based on a widely accepted urban development
practice of calculating person trips and then estimating the portion of the person trips that
would be vehicle, bicycle, walking, or transit trips. Most Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and may over predict the number of
vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit. Therefore, the trip generation in this
analysis considers the use of alternative modes. The number of overall vehicle trips
generated was determined by calculating total person trips in the weekday daily, AM, and PM
peak hour conditions and then separating the person trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto,
transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates the trip generation process.




Person trips were developed based on trip rates and average vehicle occupancy information
from ITE’s Trip Generation (9th Edition) and NCHRP 365. Person trips using each
transportation mode were determined by multiplying the total person trips by the estimated
mode splits from 2010 – 2014 American Community Survey’s Selected Economic


                                                                                         Page 14

Characteristics data for the project’s location (Census Tract #85). The First Hill neighborhood
is well-served by transit, has low vehicle ownership rates, and is close to many employment
centers in the First Hill and Downtown Seattle neighborhoods which allows residents take
many walking and biking trips.

Table 7 provides a summary of the trip generation for the proposed land uses. A detailed
summary of the trip generation calculations for these uses has been provided in Appendix D.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in Table 7, the development is anticipated to generate approximately 830 new
vehicle trips daily with approximately 60 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 73
new vehicle trips during the typical weekday PM peak hour.

Note that although the existing parking uses will be displaced, no credit has been taken for
these trips as they will either use parking from this project or other on-street or off-street
options.


Vehicle Trip Distribution & Assignment
Trip distribution patterns to and from the project site were based on existing vehicle travel
patterns, previous studies in the project vicinity, and U.S. Census Bureau’s OnTheMap tool.
OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more
likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive. As the majority of local project trips
around First Hill are anticipated to use transit or non-motorized methods to and from the site,
vehicle trips are anticipated to be longer in duration and likely directed to and from the
freeways in the area. The project trip distribution for vehicle trips is shown in Figure 5.

The anticipated weekday PM peak hour net new vehicle trip generation was assigned to the
street network and the study intersections based on the distribution patterns described above
and shown in Figure 5. At the site access, the new trip generation was assigned to the
access garage as this is a new driveway that will accommodate all project traffic.

Vehicle Traffic Volume Impact
The assigned project generated traffic was added to the future without-project weekday PM
peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections. The resulting 2019 with-project traffic
volumes are shown in Figure 6. Table 8 summarizes the percent increase of traffic volumes
at the study intersections that are attributable to the anticipated trip generation of the
proposed project during the weekday PM peak hour.

As shown in Table 8, the proposed project is anticipated to account less than 5.0 percent of
the total weekday PM peak hour traffic at the off-site study intersections with the exception of
one intersection. The project share at the 9th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection is anticipated
to be approximately 6 percent. Traffic volumes typically fluctuate day-to-day by five to ten

Vehicle Traffic Operations Impact
The following sections summarize traffic operations for existing and future conditions for
individual intersections as well as the James Street corridor.

Intersection Operations
A future with-project level-of-service analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour
to analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methodologies were applied and
all intersection parameters such as channelization and intersection control were consistent
with those used in the evaluation of future without-project conditions. A comparison of horizon
year 2019 future without-project and future with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic
operations are summarized in Table 9. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3.   Worst movement or approach reported for side-street stop-controlled intersections.


With the addition of project generated traffic during the weekday PM peak hour study period,
all study intersections would continue to operate acceptably under the same LOS as without-
project conditions with only minor increases in delay occurring. All study intersections are
anticipated to continue to operate at LOS D or better during future with-project conditions,
with the exception of the 9th Avenue/Cherry Street and the 7th Avenue/James Street
intersections which are anticipated to continue to operate at LOS F.

As described previously, the City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS
standard for individual intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as
poor operations for signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. In addition, the
project impacts may be considered significant if the intersection delay at a signalized
intersection increases by 5 or more seconds. At unsignalized intersections the delay increase
is applied to stop controlled movements, but is subjective based on the number of vehicles
impacted by the delay increase. It is anticipated that the delay at the 9th Avenue/Cherry
Street intersection would increase by more than 5 seconds. However, given the existing
gridded road system and alternative signalized locations to access Cherry Street, this impact
would not be considered significant.

Corridor Operations
Corridor travel times/speeds along James Street between 6th Avenue and Broadway were
evaluated with the addition of project generated traffic, consistent with the previously

4.   m:ss = minutes and seconds


As shown, the addition of project generated traffic along the corridor is anticipated to add
minimal delay (less than 10 seconds) along the corridor and does not result in any significant
change to the forecast average travel speed.


Site Access
The proposed project includes an underground parking garage designated for the residential,
retail, and museum uses. Access to the garage would be provided via the alley between
Terry Avenue and 9th Avenue. The alley intersections on at Columbia Street and Cherry
Street are anticipated to operate at LOS B during the weekday PM peak hour.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Two screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that were
analyzed for concurrency review include the Ship Canal between University and Montlake
Bridges (Screenline 5.16), and East of the CBD (Screenline 12.12), as shown in Table 11. As
a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the
direction from the proposed project in the direction of the screenlines would extend across
the screenlines included in this analysis.

1.   SL# = Screenline Number
2.   Direction: NB = Northbound, SB = Southbound, EB = Eastbound, WB = Westbound


The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenlines would have volume-to-capacity ratios that are less than the City’s volume-to-
capacity threshold; thus, the proposed project would meet concurrency requirements.

Transit Impacts
The transit stops and routes located near the project site provide connections to existing
transit services for residents and visitors to the project site. Additionally, the First Hill streetcar
is operational in the area providing transit service along Broadway throughout First Hill
traveling north to Capitol Hill and south to the Central District and the International District.
The nearest stop for the First Hill Streetcar is located on Broadway at Terrace Avenue which
is approximately 0.3 miles (or a 5 to 6-minute walk) from the project site. The streetcar will
increase the transit access, frequency, and reliability for tenants and patrons of the proposed
development to Capitol Hill, Downtown area, and Link light rail. Along with the existing
extensive bus network, the site will continue to be well connected to the region by transit.


Non-Motorized Impacts
Pedestrians and bicyclists are anticipated to account for a share of the trips generated by the
proposed project as the project is well served by both pedestrian and bicycle facilities. To
accommodate bicyclists, secure bicycle storage will be provided on site. The two-way cycle
track that currently existing along Broadway provides a north-south connection in East
Seattle and connects to other local and regional bicycle routes.


Parking Analysis
A parking analysis for the proposed development was completed. The following sections
describe the proposed parking supply and the estimated peak parking demand of the project.

Parking Supply
The proposed project will provide a below-grade, on-site parking garage that will be used by
building tenants, retail and museum patrons, and will replace the existing surface parking lot.
The existing on-site lot includes 95 total stalls that are used by the Frye Art Museum
(approximately 69 stalls) and the Puget Sound Blood Center (approximately 26 stalls). The
project is proposing to provide 50 stalls for the Frye Museum and 266 stalls for the residential
use, totaling 316 parking stalls.

As previously mentioned, the parking garage for the proposed project will be accessed from
the alley between Terry Avenue and 9th Avenue.

Parking Demand
The peak parking demand for the apartment uses is expected to be below national averages
due to the project’s location in the First Hill Urban Center Village, proximity to frequent transit
service, and proximity to major employment centers in First Hill and Downtown Seattle. The
peak parking demand for the proposed residential units was estimated based on the most
current local vehicle ownership rate from US Census data.1 Based on the proposed mix of
apartment units, a combined parking demand rate of 0.41 vehicles per dwelling unit was
estimated for the development’s residents. It is anticipated that residential guests would
utilize on-street parking. In addition, the peak parking demand for the retail use was
estimated to be 3 vehicles. The detailed ownership rate calculations are provided in Appendix
E.

Additionally, peak hour counts were collected to identify the peak parking demand of the
existing parking lots. The museum land use is anticipated to peak midmorning. Parking

Note: du = dwelling units, ksf = 1,000 square feet


As shown in Table 12, conservatively assuming that the peak parking demand for residential
and retail uses peak at the same time of day, the project peak parking demand is expected to
be 253 vehicles, including the Frye Art Museum and would be accommodated by the
proposed 316 parking stalls. In addition, the surplus of parking could accommodate
residential guests depending on the location of the residential access control.

The peak parking demand associated with the Puget Sound Blood Center would be displaced
to other parking lots in the area or on-street parking. The Puget Sound Blood Center use
peaked at 11 AM totaling 23 vehicles that will be displaced.

Parking Code Requirements
Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015 Table A and Table B, there are no minimum
parking requirements for multifamily uses located in urban centers. This project is located
within the First Hill Urban Center Village and thus, no minimum parking requirements apply to
the proposed development.

Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking is an important end of trip facility that is
important in promoting the use of bicycle travel to and from a site. Beyond the environmental
and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists reduce the traffic and parking
impacts of a development and support many City and Neighborhood comprehensive plan
goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is also important to keep sidewalks fully
ADA compliant and passable, and reduces the chances of bicycles obstructing emergency
escape routes.

Per SMC 23.54.015, bicycle parking is required to be provided by new developments. The
SMC requires secure, covered long-term bicycle parking for residential developments. Due to
the project’s Urban Center location and the anticipation that it will have fewer vehicle and
more non-motorized trips, the bicycle storage rate is higher. The bicycle parking requirements
for the site are shown in Table 13.

707 Terry Avenue                                                                     October 2016



                         Findings and Conclusions
This transportation impact analysis summarizes the project traffic impacts of the proposed
707 Terry Avenue multifamily development project in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle.
General findings and recommendations include:
          The proposed project would develop up to 486 multifamily residential units that
           include and approximately 7,500 square feet of retail use. This development would
           replace the existing parking lot currently occupying the project site.
          The development would generate vehicular, walking, bicycling and transit trips. The
           development is anticipated to generate approximately 830 new vehicle trips daily
           with approximately 60 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 73 vehicle
           trips during the typical weekday PM peak hour.
          Project traffic would represent less than 5 percent of the 2019 weekday PM peak
           hour traffic volumes at the off-site study intersections with the exception of the 9th
           Avenue/Cherry Street where the project would represent approximately 6 percent of
           the PM peak hour traffic volumes.
          All off-site intersections currently operate at LOS D or better with the exception of
           the 9th Avenue/Cherry Street intersections which operates at LOS F. Under future
           (2019) without-project conditions the 7th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection is
           anticipated to degrade from LOS B to LOS C, the 9th Avenue/James Street
           intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS C to LOS D, and the 7th
           Avenue/James Street intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS D to LOS F
           under future (2019) without-project conditions, the remaining intersections would
           continue to operate at the same LOS as under existing conditions. It is anticipated
           that with the addition of project generated traffic all study intersections would
           operate at the same LOS as under future (2019) without-project conditions with
           minimal increases in delay. It is anticipated; however, that the project would have a
           more than 5 second increase at the 9th Avenue/Cherry Street intersection.
          Access to the proposed project would be provided via the alley between Terry
           Avenue and 9th Avenue. The alley intersections on Columbia Street and Cherry
           Street are both anticipated to operate at LOS B.
          The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the
           project, the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City level of
           service thresholds; thus, the conditions would meet concurrency requirements.
          The proposed site is located next to frequent and reliable transit as well as near
           extensive pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The site is anticipated to have an
           approximate peak vehicle parking demand of 253 vehicles for the residential, retail
           and museum uses, if the uses were to peak at the same time. The garage will
           provide 316 parking stalls which will meet the vehicle parking demand. The project
           would be required to provide 115 long-term bicycle parking spaces.

Appendix B: LOS Definitions
                                          Highway Capacity Manual, 2000

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
