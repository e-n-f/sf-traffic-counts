MEMORANDUM

To:          Eric R. Shields, AICP, SEPA Responsible Official

From:        Tony Leavitt, Associate Planner

Date:        May 3, 2017

File:        SEP16-01414

Subject:     ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION FOR VAREZE RESIDENTIAL
             PROJECT

PROPOSAL

The applicant, Quadrant Corporation, is proposing the construction of the Vareze Residential
project at 11801 NE 116th Street (see Enclosures 1 and 2). The applicant is proposing to
construct a new 82 unit residential townhouse development on the 4.17 acre site located in
the Totem Lake Neighborhood. Parking is proposed in individual unit garage and surface
stalls.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

The SEPA "threshold determination" is the formal decision as to whether the proposal is likely
to cause a significant adverse environmental impact for which mitigation cannot be identified.
If it is determined that a proposal may have a significant adverse impact that cannot be
mitigated, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be required. Many environmental
impacts are mitigated by City codes and development regulations. For example, the Kirkland
Zoning Code has regulations that protect sensitive areas, limit noise, provide setbacks,
establish height limits, etc. Where City regulations have been adopted to address an
environmental impact, it is presumed that such regulations are adequate to achieve sufficient
mitigation [WAC 197-11-660(1)(e) and (g)]. Therefore, when requiring project mitigation
based on adverse environmental impacts, the City would first consider whether a regulation
has been adopted for the purpose of mitigating the environmental impact in question.

I have had an opportunity to visit the site, review the environmental checklist (Enclosure 3),
the Traffic Impact Analysis (Enclosure 4) prepared by the applicant’s consultant, and the
Traffic Impact Analysis Review Memo prepared by the City’s Transportation Engineer
(Enclosure 5).
                                                                                     SEP16-01414
                                                                                     Page 2




Based on a review of these materials, the main environmental issue related to the project is
potential traffic impacts.

TRAFFIC IMPACTS

The Public Works Department has reviewed the Traffic Study for the proposed development
(see Enclosure 4) and concluded that the project will not have a significant adverse traffic
impact on existing facilities. The primary issues evaluated included the driveway locations,
design and construction of right-of-way and intersection improvements. Public Works
recommends approval of the project and will be imposing a condition to pay transportation
impacts fees with the future residential building permits.

Additionally, the Public Works Department is recommending the following mitigations to
address driveway locations, design and construction of right-of-way and intersection
improvements:

      Post a performance security in the amount of $300,000 towards the cost of the new
       traffic signal to mitigate the sub-standard driveway spacing, provide the required
       easement to construct the intersection, provide a 30-foot wide access easement to the
       property to the east to give the Subaru dealership the option to access the new
       signalized intersection if the new signalized intersection is located to align with the
       Vareze driveway.

      Make half-street improvements to meet City standards and to accommodate a new
       traffic signal. The signalized intersection shall include an 11-foot left-turn lane and a
       shared 11 foot through and right-turn lane and a 14 foot receiving lane on the minor
       approaches.

      If the applicant chooses not to contribute to the construction of a traffic signal as
       described above then the applicant shall relocate the project driveway 150 feet west
       of the nearest driveway to meet the City’s driveway spacing requirement.

      The final location of the driveway will be reviewed and approved by the Public Works
       Department with the LSM permit. The final determination will be based on location of
       the traffic signal, topography, and minimizing significant impacts to the Subaru
       dealership.

The applicant has reviewed these mitigations and has agreed to incorporate them into the
development plans for the project.

CONCLUSION

It will be necessary to further analyze certain aspects of the proposal to determine if the
project complies with all the applicable City codes and policies. That analysis is most
appropriately addressed within the review of the building permit and/or land surface
                                                                                 SEP16-01414
                                                                                 Page 3




modification permit applications. In contrast, State law specifies that this environmental
review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) is to focus only on potential
significant impacts to the environment that could not be adequately mitigated through the
Kirkland regulations and Comprehensive Plan.1

Based on my review of the submitted information, I have not identified any significant
adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, I recommend that a Determination of Non-
Significance be issued for this proposed action.

                                    SEPA ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST
                                                        UPDATED MAY 2015

Purpose of checklist:
Governmental agencies use this checklist to help determine whether the environmental impacts of your
proposal are significant. This information is also helpful to determine if available avoidance, minimization
or compensatory mitigation measures will address the probable significant impacts or if an environmental
impact statement will be prepared to further analyze the proposal.

Instructions for applicants:
This environmental checklist asks you to describe some basic information about your proposal. Please
answer each question accurately and carefully, to the best of your knowledge. You may need to consult
with an agency specialist or private consultant for some questions. You may use “not applicable” or
"does not apply" only when you can explain why it does not apply and not when the answer is unknown.
You may also attach or incorporate by reference additional studies reports. Complete and accurate
answers to these questions often avoid delays with the SEPA process as well as later in the decision-
making process.

The checklist questions apply to all parts of your proposal, even if you plan to do them over a period of
time or on different parcels of land. Attach any additional information that will help describe your proposal
or its environmental effects. The agency to which you submit this checklist may ask you to explain your
answers or provide additional information reasonably related to determining if there may be significant
adverse impact.

Instructions for Lead Agencies:
Please adjust the format of this template as needed. Additional information may be necessary to
evaluate the existing environment, all interrelated aspects of the proposal and an analysis of adverse
impacts. The checklist is considered the first but not necessarily the only source of information needed to
make an adequate threshold determination. Once a threshold determination is made, the lead agency is
responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the checklist and other supporting documents.

Use of checklist for nonproject proposals: [help]
For nonproject proposals (such as ordinances, regulations, plans and programs), complete the applicable
parts of sections A and B plus the SUPPLEMENTAL SHEET FOR NONPROJECT ACTIONS (part D). Please
completely answer all questions that apply and note that the words "project," "applicant," and "property or
site" should be read as "proposal," "proponent," and "affected geographic area," respectively. The lead
agency may exclude (for non-projects) questions in Part B - Environmental Elements –that do not
contribute meaningfully to the analysis of the proposal.

B. Environmental Elements
1.   Earth

a. General description of the site:
   (circle one): Flat, rolling, hilly, steep slopes, mountainous, other:
   Mostly flat with sloped banks at the north, south and east property lines.

b. What is the steepest slope on the site (approximate percent slope)?
   The steepest slope is along the south and east property lines with and is in
   places over 100% slope, contained by existing retaining walls. This is a 20-25
   foot vertical drop from the adjacent properties to the subject property within
   20-30 feet of horizontal width.

c. What general types of soils are found on the site (for example, clay, sand, gravel,
   peat, muck)? If you know the classification of agricultural soils, specify them and
   note any agricultural land of long-term commercial significance and whether the
   proposal results in removing any of these soils.
   Review of the regional geologic maps indicates that the area of the subject site
   is underlain by Vashon-age lodgement till with Vashon advance outwash
   mapped to the south and northwest of the property, and Pre-Fraser deposits
   mapped to the north of the property. The Geotechnical report finds that their
   interpretation of the sediments encountered is in general agreement with the
   regional geologic mapping.

d. Are there surface indications or history of unstable soils in the immediate
   vicinity? If so, describe.
   The cut slopes along the south and east property lines show indications of
   shallow instability since their creation. See Geotechnical Assessment.

e. Describe the purpose, type, total area, and approximate quantities and total
   affected area of any filling, excavation, and grading proposed. Indicate source of
   fill.
   Cut: 15,000 cy
   Fill: 50,000 cy. Fill will consist of both native soils and structural fill. Off-site
   fill will be provided from an approved source.

f. Could erosion occur as a result of clearing, construction, or use? If so, generally
   describe.
   The site is not considered a significant erosion hazard area due to the steep
   slopes are maintained by retaining walls, lack of exposed soils, and likelihood
   that Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be used in conjunction with an
   approved Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) Plan.

g. About what percent of the site will be covered with impervious surfaces after
   project construction (for example, asphalt or buildings)?
   Proposed total site coverage will be a maximum of 80%.




SEPA Environmental checklist (WAC 197-11-960)            May 2014                          Page 3 of 14
h. Proposed measures to reduce or control erosion, or other impacts to the earth, if
   any:
   A temporary erosion control plan will be prepared and implemented during the
   construction phase in accordance with City Development Standards. TESC
   measures will include a temporary construction entrance, filter fabric fence,
   temporary drainage ditches, straw bales and catch basin protection.


2. Air

a. What types of emissions to the air would result from the proposal during
   construction, operation, and maintenance when the project is completed? If any,
   generally describe and give approximate quantities if known.
   Minimal emissions during construction are anticipated as a direct result of the
   construction workers use of personal, company and/or subcontractor vehicles
   to and from the site. Once the buildings are occupied automobile exhaust from
   residents entering and leaving will be the main source of emissions.

b. Are there any off-site sources of emissions or odor that may affect your
   proposal? If so, generally describe.
   Main off-site sources of emissions will be the nearby commercial uses and
   they are not anticipated to affect this proposal.

c. Proposed measures to reduce or control emissions or other impacts to air, if any:
   None proposed.


3. Water

a. Surface Water:

    1) Is there any surface water body on or in the immediate vicinity of the site
       (including year-round and seasonal streams, saltwater, lakes, ponds,
       wetlands)? If yes, describe type and provide names. If appropriate, state
       what stream or river it flows into.
       There are no surface water bodies in the vicinity of the site.

    2) Will the project require any work over, in, or adjacent to (within 200 feet) the
       described waters? If yes, please describe and attach available plans.
       Not applicable.

    3) Estimate the amount of fill and dredge material that would be placed in or
       removed from surface water or wetlands and indicate the area of the site
       that would be affected. Indicate the source of fill material.
       Not applicable.

    4) Will the proposal require surface water withdrawals or diversions? Give
       general description, purpose, and approximate quantities if known.
       None anticipated



SEPA Environmental checklist (WAC 197-11-960)          May 2014                           Page 4 of 14
    5) Does the proposal lie within a 100-year floodplain? If so, note location on the
       site plan.
       This site does not lie in a 100-year floodplain.

    6) Does the proposal involve any discharges of waste materials to surface
       waters? If so, describe the type of waste and anticipated volume of
       discharge.
       The proposed project does not involve discharges of waste materials into
       surface waters.

b. Ground Water:

    1) Will groundwater be withdrawn from a well for drinking water or other
       purposes? If so, give a general description of the well, proposed uses and
       approximate quantities withdrawn from the well. Will water be discharged
       to groundwater? Give general description, purpose, and approximate
       quantities if known.
       Water is not anticipated to be withdrawn nor discharged to groundwater
       as a direct result of the proposed project. If groundwater is encountered
       during construction, it is anticipated that it can be managed on site.

    2) Describe waste material that will be discharged into the ground from septic
       tanks or other sources, if any (for example: Domestic sewage; industrial,
       containing the following chemicals. . . ; agricultural; etc.). Describe the
       general size of the system, the number of such systems, the number of
       houses to be served (if applicable), or the number of animals or humans the
       system(s) are expected to serve.
       The property will be served by public sanitary and storm sewers.

c. Water runoff (including stormwater):

    1) Describe the source of runoff (including storm water) and method of
       collection and disposal, if any (include quantities, if known). Where will this
       water flow? Will this water flow into other waters? If so, describe.
       The source of runoff will be storm water runoff from building roof tops,
       concrete walks and asphalt pavement areas. It is intended that stormwater
       runoff will be treated onsite through the use of proprietary water quality
       treatment device and then conveyed to an onsite underground detention
       facility. Once treated and detained the runoff will be conveyed to the City
       system.

    2) Could waste materials enter ground or surface waters? If so, generally
       describe.
       It is not anticipated that waste materials will enter ground or surface
       waters.

    3) Does the proposal alter or otherwise affect drainage patterns in the vicinity
       of the site? If so, describe.


SEPA Environmental checklist (WAC 197-11-960)          May 2014                          Page 5 of 14
        Drainage patterns will be maintained in the vicinity of the site.

d. Proposed measures to reduce or control surface, ground, and runoff water, and
   drainage pattern impacts, if any:
   During the construction phase, temporary erosion control measures, ongoing
   maintenance, soil stabilization and other best management practices will be
   implemented to help reduce and control impacts from the project. Permanent
   measures to reduce and control runoff from the completed project will
   include catch basins, underground conveyance pipe, detention and water
   quality treatment as determined necessary.


4. Plants

a. Check the types of vegetation found on the site:
   __X_deciduous tree: alder, maple, aspen, other: cottonwood, madrona,
