Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared for two separate
sites on W. San Carlos Street in San Jose, California. The 740 W. San Carlos Street site is located on the
south side of W. San Carlos Street with access via Dupont Street. Development of this 0.65-acre
triangular-shaped site would include replacing the current uses on the site with 95 residential units (single
family attached) and 2,885 square feet (s.f.) of ground floor retail space. The 777 W. San Carlos Street
site is located on the northeast corner of the Sunol Street and W. San Carlos Street intersection. The
project proposes to replace the current uses on this 1.2-acre site with 104 residential units (single family
attached) and 3,150 s.f. of ground floor retail space. Figure 1 shows the project site locations.
The combined effects of the 740 and 777 W. San Carlos Street developments were analyzed together,
since the two sites will be developed at approximately the same time by the same developer. Thus, for
the purpose of identifying traffic impacts, the “project” includes a total of 199 residential units and 6,035
s.f. of retail space. The traffic study also includes a discussion of the effect of each individual site where
appropriate, should development of one site move forward and not the other.
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying potential traffic impacts related to the proposed
developments. The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set
forth by the City of San Jose. An analysis according to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines also was prepared, since the project would
generate more than 100 peak hour gross vehicle trips. The study determined the traffic impacts of the
project on ten signalized intersections, one unsignalized intersection, and seven freeway segments in the
vicinity of the project site during the weekday AM and PM peak periods of traffic.

Project Trip Generation
After applying the City of San Jose trip rates, appropriate trip reductions, and existing trip credits, the
project would generate 1,390 new daily vehicle trips, with 130 new trips occurring during the AM peak
hour and 140 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/ outbound splits contained
in the San Jose Traffic Impact Analysis Handbook, the project would produce 45 net inbound and 85 net
outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 91 net inbound and 49 net outbound trips during the PM
peak hour.

Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis shows that, measured against the City of San Jose
and CMP level of service impact criteria, none of the study intersections would be significantly impacted
by the project (see Table ES-1).




                                                                                              iii | Page 
740 & 777W San Carlos Street                                                         December 11, 2015 


Project Freeway Segment Analysis
The results of the freeway segment analysis show that the project would not cause significant increases
in traffic volumes (one percent or more of freeway capacity) on any of the study freeway segments
currently operating at LOS F, and none of the freeway segments currently operating at LOS E or better
would worsen to LOS F as a result of the project (see Table ES-2). Therefore, based on CMP freeway
impact criteria, none of the study freeway segments would be significantly impacted by the project.

Individual vs. Combined Effects of the Developments
The results of the traffic analysis show that development of both sites simultaneously would not result in
any significant traffic impacts. Therefore, should development of one site move forward and not the other,
the results of the analysis would be the same.

Other Transportation Facilities
The proposed project would be a higher density transit-oriented development located within close
proximity to LRT, local bus, Caltrain, Amtrak, and ACE transit services, and will be consistent with the
San Jose General Plan multi-modal transportation policies to collectively provide a safe, efficient, and
environmentally sensitive transportation system for the movement of people and goods.
Site access and on-site circulation would be adequate to serve both the 740 W. San Carlos Street site
and the 777 W. San Carlos Street site.

740 W. San Carlos Street Site Recommendations
       A convex mirror should be provided at the 45-degree turn on both parking levels.
       Based on the City’s parking requirements, the project would have a parking deficit. The project
        applicant should coordinate with City staff to verify the adequacy of parking provided on-site.
       The site plan does not show any loading zones. We recommend that a loading zone be added on
        Dupont Street adjacent to the lobby area that could be used by moving trucks and delivery trucks.

777 W. San Carlos Street Site Recommendations
       Based on the City’s parking requirements, the project would have a small parking deficit. The
        project applicant should coordinate with City staff to verify the adequacy of parking provided on-
        site.
       The site plan does not show any loading zones. We recommend that a loading zone be added on
        Sunol Street adjacent to the lobby area that could be used by moving trucks and delivery trucks.

Cumulative Conditions
Cumulative traffic volumes were obtained from the Diridon Station Area Plan (DSAP) EIR for consistency
purposes. Cumulative conditions consist of traffic volumes associated with the approved Downtown
Strategy 2000 and DSAP projects, plus the addition of traffic associated with the BART extension and
High Speed Rail projects. Traffic generated by the proposed 740 W. San Carlos Street project also was
included, since this triangular-shaped parcel was not specifically included in the DSAP study.
The results of the cumulative intersection level of service analysis show that the proposed project (740
and 777 W. San Carlos Street sites) is consistent with the conclusions of the DSAP EIR.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared for two separate
sites on W. San Carlos Street in San Jose, California. The 740 W. San Carlos Street site is located on the
south side of W. San Carlos Street with access via Dupont Street. Development of this 0.65-acre
triangular-shaped site would include replacing the current uses on the site with 95 residential units (single
family attached) and 2,885 square feet (s.f.) of ground floor retail space. The 777 W. San Carlos Street
site is located on the northeast corner of the Sunol Street and W. San Carlos Street intersection. The
project proposes to replace the current uses on this 1.2-acre site with 104 residential units (single family
attached) and 3,150 s.f. of ground floor retail space. Figure 1 shows the project site locations.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying potential traffic impacts related to the proposed
developments. The combined effects of the 740 and 777 W. San Carlos Street developments were
analyzed together, since the two sites will be developed at approximately the same time by the same
developer. Thus, for the purpose of identifying traffic impacts, the “project” includes a total of 199
residential units and 6,035 s.f. of retail space. The traffic study also includes a discussion of the effect of
each individual site where appropriate, should development of one site move forward and not the other.
The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set forth by the City
of San Jose. An analysis according to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Congestion
Management Program (CMP) guidelines also was prepared, since the project would generate more than
100 peak hour gross vehicle trips. The study determined the traffic impacts of the project on eleven
signalized intersections, one unsignalized intersection, and seven freeway segments in the vicinity of the
project site during the weekday AM and PM peak periods of traffic. The study intersections and freeway
segments are identified below. Three study intersections are CMP intersections, as indicated below.

adjacent street traffic. The AM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM,
and the PM peak hour of adjacent street traffic is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these
periods on an average weekday that the most congested traffic conditions occur.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
   Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from the City of San Jose,
                  2013 CMP count data, and new 2015 manual turning-movement counts. The new
                  intersection count data are included in Appendix A.
   Scenario 2:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes were
                  estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                  project. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                  order to determine the effects the project would have on existing traffic conditions.
   Scenario 3:    Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                  existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
                  developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet completed developments
                  was provided by the City of San Jose in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI).
   Scenario 4:    Background Plus Project Conditions. Projected near-term peak hour traffic volumes with
                  the project were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the additional traffic
                  generated by the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
                  background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts according to the
                  City of San Jose Level of Service Policy.
   Scenario 5:    Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative traffic volumes were obtained from the Diridon
                  Station Area Plan (DSAP) EIR. Cumulative conditions consist of traffic volumes
                  associated with the approved Downtown Strategy 2000 and DSAP projects, plus the
                  addition of traffic associated with the BART extension and High Speed Rail (HSR)
                  projects. For consistency purposes, the proposed project was compared to the amount
                  of development assumed under the DSAP for the same site.

Protected Intersections
Two of the intersections that are analyzed in this study are identified as Protected Intersections in the
City’s Transportation Level of Service (LOS) Policy, Council Policy 5-3. Protected Intersections consist of
locations (there are a total of 25) that have been built to their planned maximum capacity and where
expansion of the intersection would have an adverse effect on other transportation facilities (such as
pedestrian, bicycle, transit systems, etc.). Protected Intersections are, therefore, not required to maintain
a Level of Service D, which is the City of San Jose standard. The deficiencies at all 25 Protected
Intersections in the City of San Jose have been disclosed and overridden in previous EIRs.
If a development project has significant traffic impacts at a designated Protected Intersection, the project
may be approved if offsetting Transportation System Improvements are provided. The offsetting
improvements are intended to provide other transportation benefits for the community adjacent to the
traffic impact. The improvements may include enhancements to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities,
as well as neighborhood traffic calming measures and other roadway improvements.

                                                                                              3 | Page

The City will identify the specific offsetting improvements, which should be agreed upon by the
community. Priority is given to improvements identified in previously adopted plans such as area-wide
specific or master plans, redevelopment plans, or plans prepared through the Strong Neighborhoods
Initiative. Community outreach should occur in conjunction with the project review and approval process.
Once the specific improvements have been identified, the developer must submit improvement plans to
the City of San Jose Department of Public Works for review and approval.
The LOS Policy has established a fee equal to $2,821 per net peak hour project trip for one intersection
impact and $4,232 per net peak hour project trip for multiple intersection impacts to fund alternative
transportation improvements. For the purpose of determining the Protected Intersection LOS impact fee,
net peak hour project trips are defined as the total number of peak hour trips generated by the project
during the highest peak hour period after all appropriate trip credits have been applied. The value of the
improvements should be equal to the established fees.

Downtown Core Intersections
Intersections that are located within the downtown core are exempt from the City of San Jose’s level of
service policy and traffic mitigation requirements. The downtown core includes the areas generally to the
west near Diridon Station, north to Taylor Street, to the east near San Jose State University and City Hall,
and south to I-280. Although three of the study intersections are located within the downtown core area,
these exempt intersections were evaluated following the standard LOS procedures in order to disclose
the LOS at these intersections.

Study Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, the City of San Jose, the Santa
Clara VTA CMP, and field observations. The following data were collected from these sources:

   existing traffic volumes
   approved project trips
   intersection lane configurations
   signal timing and phasing
   average speeds on freeway segments

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are
described below.

City of San Jose Intersections
The City of San Jose level of service methodology for signalized intersections is the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) method. This method is applied using the TRAFFIX software. The 2000 HCM
operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time
for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersection level of service
methodology, the City of San Jose methodology employs the CMP default values for the analysis
parameters. The City of San Jose level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS D or better.
The correlation between average control delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.



                                                                                               4 | Page

CMP Intersections
The designated level of service methodology for the CMP also is the 2000 HCM operations method for
signalized intersections, using TRAFFIX. The only difference in level of service standards is that in the
City of San Jose the standard is LOS D or better, and the CMP level of service standard for signalized
intersections is LOS E or better.

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the
    A       green phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to       10.0 or less
            the very low vehicle delay.

            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle
    B       lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average        10.1 to 20.0
            vehicle delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
    C                                                                                            20.1 to 35.0
            of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the
            intersection without stopping.

            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
            result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
    D                                                                                            35.1 to 55.0
            lenghts, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
            individual cycle failures are noticeable.

            This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
    E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high             55.1 to 80.0
            volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
    F                                                                                          greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may
            also be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Intersection Operations
The analysis of intersection level of service is often supplemented with an analysis of intersection
operations for selected intersections where the project would add a significant number of left-turning
vehicles. The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand turning-movements at
intersections. Vehicle queues are estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the
probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
                 P (x=n) =        n e – (
                                     n!
        where:
                 P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
                 n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
                 Avg. # of vehicles in queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)

                                                                                                 5 | Page 
740 & 777 W. San Carlos Street                                                         December 11, 2015 


The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-
turn storage requirements at signalized intersections.
The 95th percentile queue length value indicates that during the peak hour, a queue of this length or less
would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue length larger than the 95th percentile queue
would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a
60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-turn storage pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue
length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile
queue length is also known as the “design queue length.”

Unsignalized Intersections
One of the study intersections is unsignalized: McEvoy Street and W. San Carlos Street. The need for
signalization of unsignalized intersections is assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant
3) described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4). This
method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication whether
vehicular peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal.
Intersections that meet the peak hour warrant are subject to further analysis before determining that a
traffic signal is necessary. Additional analysis may include unsignalized level of service analysis and/or
operational analysis such as evaluating vehicle queuing and delay. Other types of traffic control devices,
signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing field conditions and intersection
spacing. The unsignalized intersection of McEvoy Street and W. San Carlos Street is evaluated in
Chapter 6 of this traffic report.

Freeway Segments
As prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated
based on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:
                 D = V / (N*S)
        where:
                 D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                 V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                 N= number of travel lanes
                 S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)
The vehicle density on a freeway segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 2. The CMP
specifies that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for mixed-flow lane segments
that are three lanes or wider in one direction, and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl for mixed-flow lane segments
that are two lanes wide in one direction. A capacity of 1,800 vphpl was used for high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better.

General Plan Transportation Policies
The Circulation Element of the Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan includes a set of balanced, long-
range, multi modal transportation goals and policies that provide for a transportation network that is safe,
efficient and sustainable (minimizes environmental, financial, and neighborhood impacts). These
transportation goals and policies are intended to improve multi-modal accessibility to all land uses and
create a city where people are less reliant on driving to meet their daily needs. San Jose’s Transportation
Goals, Policies and Actions aim to:

       Establish circulation policies that increase bicycle, pedestrian and transit travel while reducing
        motor vehicle trips to increase the City’s share of travel by alternative transportation modes.
       Promote San Jose as a walking and bicycling-first city by providing and prioritizing funding for
        projects that enhance and improve bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

                                                                                              6 | Page

           almost completely unimpeded in their ability to maneuver within the traffic stream.

           Speeds at the free-flow speed are generally maintained. The ability to maneuver
   B       within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted, and the general level of              11.1 to 18.0
           physical and psychological comfort provided to drivers is still high.

           Speeds at or near the free-flow speed of the freeway prevail. Freedom to
   C       maneuver within the traffic stream is noticeably restricted, and lane changes                18.1 to 26.0
           require more vigilance on the part of the driver.

           Speeds begin to decline slightly with increased flows at this level. Freedom to
   D       maneuver within the traffic stream is more noticeably limited, and the driver                26.1 to 46.0
           experiences reduced physical and psychological comfort levels.

           At this level, the freeway operates at or near capacity. Operations in this level are
   E       volatile, because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic stream, leaving          46.1 to 58.0
           little room to maneuver within the traffic stream.

    F      Vehicular flow breakdowns occur. Large queues form behind breakdown points.                greater than 58.0

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the project sites, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Also
included are the existing levels of service of the key intersections in the study area.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the study area is provided by SR 87 and I-280. Local access to the study area is
provided via Meridian Avenue, Race Street, Lincoln Avenue, Sunol Street, Bird Avenue, Park Avenue,
San Carlos Street, and Auzerais Avenue. These facilities are described below.
SR 87 is primarily a six-lane Freeway (four mixed-flow lanes and two HOV lanes) that is aligned in a
north-south orientation within the project vicinity. SR 87 begins at its interchange with SR 85 and extends
northward, terminating at its junction with US 101. Site access to and from SR 87 is provided via Auzerais
Avenue and Park Avenue.
I-280 extends from US 101 in San Jose to I-80 in San Francisco. It is generally an east-west oriented
eight-lane Freeway in the vicinity of downtown San Jose. The section of I-280 just north of the Bascom
Avenue over-crossing has six mixed-flow lanes and two high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lanes. Site access
to and from I-280 is provided via freeway ramps at Parkmoor Avenue, Race Street, Meridian Avenue and
Bird Avenue.
Meridian Avenue is a two-to-four-lane north/south City Connector Street that runs from Camden Avenue
in South San Jose northward to Park Avenue, where it terminates. Automobiles, bicycles, pedestrians
and trucks are prioritized equally on City Connector Streets. Within the study area, Meridian Avenue has
a posted speed limit of 35 mph. Meridian Avenue provides access to and from I-280, and provides site
access via San Carlos Street. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street.
Race Street is a two-lane Local Connector Street extending from The Alameda to just south of I-280,
where it becomes Cherry Avenue. Automobiles, bicycles, pedestrians and trucks are prioritized equally on
Local Connector Streets. The posted speed limit on Race Street is 25 mph north of San Carlos Street,
and 30 mph south of San Carlos Street. Race Street has a partial interchange (northbound off-ramp) with
I-280 and provides site access via San Carlos Street and Auzerais Avenue. Race Street has Class II bike
lanes between Auzerais and Parkmoor Avenues. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street.
Lincoln Avenue is a north-south Local Connector Street surrounded by a mix of commercial, light
industrial and residential land uses in the study area. South of I-280, Lincoln Avenue is a Main Street.
Main Streets support many transportation modes, with significant emphasis given to pedestrian activity.
Lincoln Avenue consists of four lanes and has a posted speed limit of 35 mph south of San Carlos Street.
North of San Carlos Street, Lincoln Avenue consists of two lanes and has a posted speed limit of 25 mph.


                                                                                                8 | Page

Lincoln Avenue provides site access via San Carlos Street and Auzerais Avenue. Sidewalks are located
on both sides of the street.
Sunol Street is a north-south two-lane Local Connector Street that extends from The Alameda south to
Savaker Street near I-280. Sunol Street serves a mix of residential, commercial and light industrial land
uses. Sunol Street has a posted speed limit of 25 mph and has sidewalks on both sides of the street.
Bird Avenue is a four- to six-lane north-south City Connector Street that provides direct access to I-280.
Bird Avenue extends from the Willow Glen area of San Jose to Park Avenue, where it splits into a pair of
one-way streets – Montgomery Street (southbound) and Autumn Street (northbound). Bird Avenue has a
posted speed limit of 35 mph and provides site access via San Carlos Street and Auzerais Avenue.
Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street.
Park Avenue is a Local Connector Street in the vicinity of the project site providing direct access to SR
87. Park Avenue extends east to west from Market Street to Meridian Avenue where it bends to the north,
terminating at Santa Clara University. Between Market Street and Delmas Avenue, Park Avenue consists
of four lanes. Park Avenue narrows to two lanes between Delmas Street and Montgomery Street, and
widens back to four lanes from Montgomery Street to Sunol Street. Park Avenue consists of two lanes
from Sunol Street to its terminus at Santa Clara University. Land uses located along Park Avenue are
predominantly residential and commercial. Park Avenue has a posted speed limit of 30 mph and provides
site access via Sunol Street. Park Avenue has Class II bike lanes between Sunol Street and Montgomery
Street, and has sidewalks on both sides of the street.
San Carlos Street is an east-west four-lane City Connector Street that extends from San Jose State
University westward, ultimately becoming Stevens Creek Boulevard west of Bascom Avenue. Land uses
located along San Carlos are generally commercial, with parking provided on both sides of the street in
most areas. San Carlos Street is grade separated where it passes over the Southern Pacific Railroad
tracks. San Carlos Street has a posted speed limit of 35 mph within the study area and provides direct
access to the project sites. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street.
Auzerais Avenue is a two-lane Local Connector Street that extends east to west from Woz Way to Race
Street. Land uses along Auzerais Avenue are residential, commercial and light industrial. The posted
speed limit on Auzerais Avenue is 25 mph. Auzerais Avenue provides access to the project site via Sunol
Street. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street, except for the section between Race Street and
Sunol Street where some short segments of sidewalk are missing.
McEvoy Street is a short north-south Local Connector Street that connects W. San Carlos Street and
Park Avenue. McEvoy Street serves a mix of commercial and light industrial land uses and provides
access to and from the site via Dupont Street. McEvoy Street has an assumed speed limit of 25 mph and
has a continuous sidewalk on the east side of the street. On the west side of McEvoy Street,
approximately 1/3 of the sidewalk is missing between W. San Carlos Street and Park Avenue.

General Plan Transportation Policies
San Jose desires to provide a safe, efficient, fiscally, economically, and environmentally-sensitive
transportation system that balances the needs of bicyclists, pedestrians, and public transit riders with
those of automobiles and trucks. The existing bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities in the study area
are described below.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist mostly of sidewalks along the streets in the immediate vicinity of the project
site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are located at all of the signalized
intersections in the study area. There are some segments of roadway (e.g., Auzerais Avenue between
Race Street and Sunol Street) where sidewalks are not continuous or are very narrow. Those roadway
segments provide access to commercial and light industrial uses. Overall, the existing network of
sidewalks has good connectivity and provides pedestrians with safe routes to transit services and other
points of interest in the area.


                                                                                              9 | Page 
740 & 777 W. San Carlos Street                                                                        December 11, 2015 


Only two short segments of roadway in the vicinity of the project site include Class II county-designated
bike lanes: Race Street between Auzerais Avenue and Parkmoor Avenue, and Park Avenue between
Sunol Street and Montgomery Street. City-designated bike routes also are very limited in the study area.
The San Jose Diridon station is located less than 2,000 feet walking distance of both project sites, and
bicycles are allowed on the LRT trains and Caltrain.
A connection to the northern segment of the Los Gatos Creek Trail system is located adjacent to the 740
W. San Carlos Street project site with access provided via Dupont Street. The off-street trail begins at
San Carlos Street and extends south. From San Carlos Street, the Guadalupe River multi-use trail system
can be accessed. The Guadalupe River trail system is an 11-mile trail that runs through the City of San
Jose along the Guadalupe River and is shared with pedestrians and separated from motor vehicle traffic.
The Guadalupe River trail is a continuous Class I bikeway from Curtner Avenue in the south to SR 237 in
the north.

Existing Transit Services
Existing transit services in the study area are provided by the VTA, Caltrain, Altamont Commuter Express
(ACE), and Amtrak and are described below. The transit stations and local VTA bus lines near the project
sites are shown on Figure 2.

VTA Light Rail Transit (LRT) Service
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) currently operates the 42.2-mile VTA light rail line
system extending from south San Jose through downtown to the northern areas of San Jose, Santa
Clara, Milpitas, Mountain View and Sunnyvale. The service operates nearly 24-hours a day with 15-
minute headways during much of the day.
The Mountain View-Winchester LRT line operates within close proximity of both project sites, and
provides service between downtown Mountain View, downtown San Jose, and Winchester Boulevard in
Campbell. The San Jose Diridon station is located along this LRT line and is served by Caltrain, ACE,
and Amtrak. The San Jose Diridon station is located less than 2,000 feet walking distance of both sites.

VTA Bus Service
The VTA bus lines that operate within the study area are listed below in Table 3, including their terminus
points, closest scheduled stop, and commute hour headways. Local routes 23, 65 and 81, as well as
limited stop route 323, run along San Carlos Street adjacent to the project sites. The existing bus stop
located on San Carlos Street is served by routes 23, 65 and 81.

Caltrain Service
The San Jose Diridon Station is located less than 2,000 feet walking distance from both project sites and
is served by Caltrain. Caltrain provides commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy, and
currently operates 86 trains that carry about 42,350 riders on an average weekday. The Diridon station
provides 581 parking spaces, as well as 18 bike racks and 48 bike lockers. Trains stop frequently at the
Diridon station between 4:30 AM and 10:30 PM in the northbound direction, and between 6:26 AM and
1:32 AM in the southbound direction. Caltrain provides passenger train service seven days a week, and
provides extended service to Morgan Hill and Gilroy during commute hours.

Altamont Commuter Express Service
The Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) provides commuter passenger train service across the Altamont
between Stockton and San Jose during the weekdays. ACE stops at the San Jose Diridon station four
times during both the morning and evening commute hours.

Amtrak Service
Amtrak provides daily commuter passenger train service along the 170-mile Capitol Corridor between the
Sacramento region and the Bay Area, with stops in San Jose, Santa Clara, Fremont, Hayward, Oakland,
Emeryville, Berkeley, Richmond, Martinez, Suisun City, Davis, Sacramento, Roseville, Rocklin, and
Auburn. The Capitol Corridor trains stop at the San Jose Diridon station eight times during the weekdays
between approximately 7:40 AM and 11:55 PM in the westbound direction. In the eastbound direction,
Amtrak stops at the Diridon station seven times during the weekdays between 6:40 AM and 7:15 PM.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were confirmed by observations in the field and
are shown on Figure 3.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday AM (7:00-9:00 AM) and PM (4:00-6:00 PM) peak hour traffic volumes were obtained
from the City of San Jose, the VTA, and new manual turning-movement counts. All new 2015 count data
have been reviewed and approved by the City of San Jose Department of Transportation.
The existing peak hour traffic volumes are shown graphically on Figure 4. New 2015 count data are
included in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose
and CMP level of service standards, all of the study intersections currently operate at an acceptable level
of service during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table
4. The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions were observed in the field to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic
problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the
level of service analysis does not accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.
AM and PM field observations revealed that overall the study intersections operate well, and the level of
service calculations accurately reflect existing conditions. However, field observations revealed that some
minor operational problems currently occur that may not be reflected in the intersection level of service
calculations, as indicated below.

Sunol Street and Auzerais Avenue
Long wait times periodically occur at this intersection due to the LRT train preemption. However, this
intersection experiences low traffic volumes and queuing issues were not observed.

Montgomery Street and Park Avenue
The westbound left-turn pocket is short and vehicles spill out of the turn pocket on occasion during the
PM peak hour. However, all of the vehicles in the queue clear the intersection in one signal cycle. During
the AM peak hour, the northbound left-turn vehicle queue also occasionally spills out of the turn pocket.
However, all of the queued vehicles clear most of the time.


                                                                                                                                     16 | Page

Bird Avenue and San Carlos Street
During the AM peak hour, the northbound left turn vehicle queues frequently spill out of the turn pocket.
When this occurs, the queued vehicles clear the intersection in one signal cycle about half of the time.

Bird Avenue at Auzerais Avenue and I-280 Freeway Ramps
The Bird Avenue/Auzerais Avenue and Bird Avenue/I-280 interchange signals are coordinated and
operate adequately most of the day. Most vehicles clear the series of three intersections in one signal
cycle length. However, two cycles are often needed in the AM for all vehicles on the I-280 northbound off-
ramp to exit the ramp due to the close proximity of the off-ramp to Auzerais Avenue. In addition, there is a
relatively high volume of vehicles exiting northbound I-280 at Bird Street and getting right back on the
freeway to avoid the backup on northbound I-280. As a result, those vehicles (westbound through
movement) are stealing off-ramp capacity away from the westbound left-turn movement and, more
importantly, the high volume right-turn movement. Note that the middle lane on the off-ramp has a shared
left/through/right configuration. Note also that although the I-280 northbound on-ramp is metered in the
PM, it does not back up to Bird Avenue.
During the PM peak hour, the southbound left-turn vehicle queue at the Bird Avenue/I-280 southbound
on-ramp intersection extends back through the Bird Avenue/Auzerais Avenue intersection due to the
high-demand southbound left-turn movement and the metering light on the I-280 southbound on-ramp. As
a result, it often takes two signal cycles for all of the vehicles to clear the intersection. Also during the PM
peak hour, the southbound left-turn vehicle queues at the Bird Avenue/Auzerais Avenue intersection often
spill out of the left-turn pocket. Consequently, two signal cycles are usually needed for all of the vehicles
to clear the intersection.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes existing plus project traffic conditions, including the method by which project traffic
is estimated. Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were to be
occupied prior to all other approved projects in the area. It is unlikely that this traffic condition would
occur, since other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely be built and
occupied during the time the proposed project is going through the development review process.

Transportation Network Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions would
be the same as the existing transportation network.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets. These procedures are described further in the following sections.

Trip Generation
Trips generated by any new development can be estimated based on counts of existing development of
the same land use type. The City of San Jose has used count data of existing development that has been
collected over the years to derive a list of trip generation rates for the most common land uses. The trip
generation rates that have been developed can be applied to new development within the City to help
predict future traffic increases that would result from new development. These recommended rates are
detailed in the San Jose Traffic Impact Analysis Handbook, November 2009. Therefore, trip generation
resulting from new development proposed within the City of San Jose typically is estimated by multiplying
the City’s established trip generation rates by the size of the development.

Trip Reductions
Based on the Santa Clara VTA TIA Guidelines, November 2009, the project qualifies for two trip
reductions: a transit reduction and a mixed-use development reduction. Since the project would be
located within 2,000 feet of a major transit facility (San Jose Diridon Station), a 9 percent trip reduction
can be applied to the residential component of the project. In addition, since the project would consist of a
mix of residential and retail uses, a 15 percent trip reduction can be applied (to the smaller trip generator)
to account for the internalization of trips between the two land use components of the project.

                                                                                            18 | Page

A retail pass-by trip reduction of 25 percent (typical for Santa Clara County) also can be applied to the net
peak hour trip generation estimates for the proposed retail space. Pass-by-trips are trips that would
already be on the adjacent roadways (and so are already counted in the background traffic) but would
turn into the site while passing by. Justification for applying the pass-by-trip reduction is founded on the
observation that such retail traffic is not actually generated by the retail development, but is already part
of the ambient traffic levels.

Existing Uses
Trips that are generated by existing occupied uses can be subtracted from the gross project trip
generation estimates. The existing uses on both sites are occupied and are generating traffic. Thus, the
project can receive trip credits for this existing uses. The site driveways were counted on March 12, 2015
during the AM and PM peak hours.

Net Project Trips
After applying the City of San Jose trip rates, appropriate trip reductions, and existing site trip credits, the
project would generate 1,390 new daily vehicle trips, with 130 new trips occurring during the AM peak
hour and 140 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/outbound splits contained
in the San Jose Traffic Impact Analysis Handbook, the project would produce 45 net inbound and 85 net
outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 91 net inbound and 49 net outbound trips during the PM
peak hour. Table 6 shows the project trip generation estimates.

Trip Distribution Pattern and Trip Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the project was developed based on existing travel patterns on the
surrounding roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. The peak hour vehicle trips
generated by the project were assigned to the roadway network in accordance with the trip distribution
pattern, with an emphasis on freeway access and project driveway locations.
Figure 5 shows the residential and retail project trip distribution patterns. Figure 6 shows the project trip
assignment for the 740 W. San Carlos Street site. Figure 7 shows the project trip assignment for the 777
W. San Carlos Street site.

Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The project trips were added to existing traffic volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes (see
Figure 8). Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions show that,
measured against the City of San Jose and CMP level of service standards, all of the study intersections
would operate at an acceptable level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic (see
Table 7).

The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

  A 15% residential/retail mixed-use trip reduction was applied to the project per the Santa Clara VTA TIA
  Guidelines. The 15% trip reduction was first applied to the smaller trip generator (retail). The same
  number of trips were then subtracted from the larger trip generator (residential) to account for both trip ends.
4
  A 9% transit reduction was applied to the residential component of the project, since the project site is located
  within 2,000 feet of an LRT station. (Santa Clara VTA TIA Guidelines)
5
  A pass-by trip reduction of 25% was applied to the retail component of the project. The reduction was applied to the
  net retail trips after applying the mixed-use reduction.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed project. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise volumes from
existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in the vicinity of the site.
This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes and the resulting
traffic conditions. The background scenario predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as
approved development gets built and occupied.

Background Transportation Network
It was assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would be the
same as the existing network.

Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak hour volumes the
estimated traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments. The added traffic from approved
but not yet constructed developments in the City of San Jose was obtained from the City’s Approved
Trips Inventory (ATI). Background traffic volumes are shown graphically on Figure 9.
The ATI is contained in Appendix B. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in
Appendix C.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Background Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are shown in Table
8. The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose and CMP level of service standards, all
of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service during both the AM and PM
peak hours of traffic under background conditions. The intersection level of service calculation sheets are
included in Appendix D.

Background Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes near-term traffic conditions that most likely would occur when the project is
complete. It includes a description of the City of San Jose significance criteria used to establish what
constitutes a project impact, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts caused by
the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order
to determine potential project impacts. This traffic scenario represents a more congested traffic condition
than the existing plus project scenario, since it includes traffic generated by approved but not yet built
projects in the area.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used
to determine significant impacts on signalized intersections are based on City of San Jose Level of
Service standards. The City of San Jose LOS Policy is the adopted threshold for CEQA. Project impacts
on CMP study intersections and freeway segments were analyzed according to the VTA Congestion
Management Program (CMP) methodology.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of San Jose if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project conditions,
       or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by one percent (.01) or more, or
    3. The level of service at a designated Protected Intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under
       background conditions and the addition of project trips causes the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C)
       to increase by one-half percent (.005) or more.
An exception to rule #2 above applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

                                                                                             29 | Page

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San Jose, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better. Thus, a
CMP intersection that operates at LOS F would fail to meet the CMP level of service standard.

CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts
The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better. A project is
said to create a significant impact on traffic conditions on a freeway segment if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better under
       existing conditions to an unacceptable LOS F with the addition of project trips, or
    2. The level of service on the freeway segment is already operating at an unacceptable LOS F and
       the number of project trips added to the segment constitutes at least one percent of capacity of
       the segment.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to existing conditions or better.

Transportation Network Under Background Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background plus project conditions
would be the same as the existing transportation network.

Project Trip Estimates
As described in Chapter 3, after applying the City of San Jose trip rates, appropriate trip reductions, and
existing trip credits, the project would generate 1,390 new daily vehicle trips, with 130 new trips occurring
during the AM peak hour and 140 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/
outbound splits contained in the San Jose Traffic Impact Analysis Handbook, the project would produce
45 net inbound and 85 net outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 91 net inbound and 49 net
outbound trips during the PM peak hour.

Background Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The peak hour vehicle trips generated by the project were assigned to the roadway network in
accordance with the trip distribution patterns described in Chapter 3. Figures 5 and 6 in Chapter 3 show
the gross trip assignments for the residential and retail components of the project, respectively. The net
peak hour project trips were added to background traffic volumes to obtain background plus project traffic
volumes (shown on Figure 10).
Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection LOS Under Background Plus Project Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus project conditions show
that, measured against the City of San Jose and CMP level of service standards, all of the study
intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic (see Table 9). Therefore, none of the intersections would be significantly impacted by the project.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Individual vs. Combined Effects of the Developments
For the purpose of identifying traffic impacts, the combined effects of the 740 and 777 W. San Carlos
Street residential developments were analyzed together. This approach was taken because, as planned,
the two sites will be developed at approximately the same time by the same developer. The results of the
traffic analysis show that development of both sites simultaneously would not result in any significant
traffic impacts. Therefore, should development of one site move forward and not the other, the results of
the analysis would be the same.

Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
The results of the CMP freeway level of service analysis are summarized in Table 10. Traffic volumes on
the study freeway segments were estimated by adding project trips to the existing volumes obtained from
the 2012 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results show that the project would not cause significant
increases in traffic volumes (one percent or more of freeway capacity) on any of the study freeway
segments currently operating at LOS F. The results of the CMP freeway level of service analysis are
summarized in Table 10.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project, including:
        Intersection operations analysis – vehicle queuing and storage at selected intersections
        Unsignalized intersection analysis – McEvoy Street and W. San Carlos Street
        Potential project impacts to transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities
        Site access, on-site circulation and parking
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this
chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by
the traffic engineering community.

Intersection Operations Analysis
The analysis of intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of left-turn pocket storage
and vehicle queuing for intersections where the project would add a notable number of left turns. For the
purpose of this analysis, 5 or more peak hour vehicle trips were considered a noteworthy number of left
turns. Accordingly, not all of the study intersections were evaluated for left-turn vehicle queues. The
operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high demand turning movements at intersections.
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of
“n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
         P (x=n) =       n e – (
                            n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Average # of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned available storage
capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-turn storage
requirements at signalized intersections. The 95th percentile queue length value indicates that during the
peak hour, a queue of this length or less would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue
length larger than the 95th percentile queue would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3
cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a 60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-turn storage
pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue length would ensure that storage space would be
exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile queue length is also known as the “design queue
length.” The queue estimates and a tabulated summary of the findings are provided in Tables 11 and 12.

Bird Avenue and I-280 Ramps (South)
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket on
Bird Avenue at the I-280 southbound on-ramp currently exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity
during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic, and that this condition would continue to occur under
existing plus project, background, and background plus project conditions. The southbound left-turn
vehicle queues at the Bird Avenue/I-280 ramps (south) intersection are long due to the high-demand
movement and the metering light on the I-280 southbound on-ramp. It often takes two signal cycles for all
of the vehicles to clear the intersection. The southbound left-turn pocket provides 425 feet of vehicle
storage for a capacity of up to 17 vehicles. The 95th percentile vehicle queue currently is 450 feet during
the AM peak hour and 625 feet during the PM peak hour. A maximum queue of 925 feet would occur
during the PM peak hour under background conditions as a result of approved projects in the area. The
project would increase the maximum vehicle queue by one vehicle length to 950 feet. It is not possible to
provide additional southbound left-turn pocket storage at this intersection.

Bird Avenue and W. San Carlos Street
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the northbound left-turn pocket at
the Bird Avenue/W. San Carlos Street intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity,
and that this condition would continue to occur under existing plus project, background, and background
plus project conditions. The northbound left-turn pocket provides 250 feet of vehicle storage for a capacity
of up to 10 vehicles. The 95th percentile vehicle queue currently is 350 feet during the AM peak hour and
250 feet during the PM peak hour. A maximum queue of 375 feet would occur during the AM peak hour
under background conditions as a result of approved projects in the area. The project would not increase
the maximum vehicle queue. It is not possible to provide additional left-turn pocket storage due to back-
to-back left-turn pockets.

Sunol Street and W. San Carlos Street
The southbound left-turn, through and right-turn movements on Sunol Street share a lane. Therefore, the
calculated vehicle queues include the total southbound volumes. Based on the queuing analysis, the
maximum southbound vehicle queues at this intersection would require 325 feet of vehicle storage under
background plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. Sunol Street provides approximately 250
feet of vehicle storage between W. San Carlos Street and Pacific Avenue. Thus, a vehicle queue of more
than 250 feet would block Pacific Avenue. Note that the project would increase the 95th percentile vehicle
queue by one vehicle length when compared to background conditions.

Meridian Avenue and W. San Carlos Street
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound dual left-turn pocket
would exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity under both background and background plus project
conditions during the PM peak hour. The westbound dual left-turn pocket provides 250 feet of vehicle
storage per lane, which can accommodate 10 vehicles per lane. The estimated 95th percentile vehicle
queue during the PM peak hour under background and background plus project conditions would exceed
the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle per lane. A maximum left-turn pocket storage
inadequacy of one vehicle per lane is not likely to result in any operational problems at this intersection.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
Unlike signalized intersections, which typically represent constraint points for the roadway network,
unsignalized intersections rarely limit the potential capacity of a roadway. The determination of
appropriate improvements to unsignalized intersections typically includes a qualitative and quantitative
analysis of movement delay, vehicle queuing, and intersection safety. For this reason, improvements to
unsignalized intersections are frequently determined on the basis of professional judgment. The City of
San Jose has not established significance thresholds for unsignalized intersections.
An operational analysis was conducted for the unsignalized intersection of McEvoy Street and W. San
Carlos Street in order to determine the vehicle queuing and delay that would occur at this location with

                                                                                           37 | Page

the addition of traffic generated by the 740 W. San Carlos Street development. A signal warrant is
another tool for measuring the operations of an unsignalized intersection. The need for signalization of
unsignalized intersections is assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) described in
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4). This method makes no
evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication whether vehicular peak hour
traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal. Intersections that meet
the peak hour warrant are subject to further analysis before determining that a traffic signal is necessary.
Further analysis may include additional signal warrants and/or unsignalized level of service analysis.
Other types of traffic control devices, signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing
field conditions.

Vehicle Delay and Queuing
During the AM and PM peak hours of traffic, the northbound and southbound stop-controlled movements
at the McEvoy Street/W. San Carlos Street intersection currently operate with little delay due to sufficient
gaps in traffic on W. San Carlos Street. The simultaneous gaps in the eastbound and westbound
directions make it possible for vehicles on the minor street approaches to turn left onto W. San Carlos
Street during both peak commute periods of the day.
The northbound leg of the McEvoy Street/W. San Carlos Street intersection will be closed off as part of
the project, resulting in a T-intersection configuration. With this configuration, most vehicles entering the
740 W. San Carlos Street site and all vehicles exiting the site will do so via Dupont Street under the W.
San Carlos Street overpass. Thus, most project-generated trips will end up using McEvoy Street, north of
W. San Carlos Street, to access the site. The planned street closure is described in more detail in the Site
Access and Circulation section of this chapter.
The addition of traffic generated by approved projects in the area, as well as trips generated by the 740
W. San Carlos Street project, would result in only minor increases in vehicle delay (less than 2 seconds of
delay per vehicle) and queuing for the southbound movement of the unsignalized intersection. The small
increase in delay on the southbound approach would be due mostly to increased traffic on W. San Carlos
Street as a result of other approved projects in the area that are included under background conditions.
The traffic increase on W. San Carlos Street under background conditions would reduce the number of
gaps in traffic and make it slightly more difficult for vehicles to merge onto W. San Carlos Street, although
the minor increase in delay most likely would not be noticeable.
The results of the unsignalized intersection analysis show that the stop-controlled southbound approach
of the McEvoy Street/W. San Carlos Street intersection currently experiences LOS C operation and would
continue to operate at LOS C under both background and background plus project conditions.

Gap Analysis – W. San Carlos Street
Left turns from a minor street approach are more challenging than right turns because they require
sufficient gaps in traffic in both directions of travel. If there are insufficient gaps for drivers, then long
vehicle delays will occur. To determine the number of simultaneous gaps in traffic on eastbound and
westbound W. San Carlos Street, gap counts were conducted at McEvoy Street. Based on observations
of vehicle speeds, sight distance and driver behavior, the minimum two-way gap time required for a
vehicle to turn left onto W. San Carlos Street from McEvoy Street or to go straight through the intersection
is between 5 and 10 seconds. In order to provide a conservative analysis, a minimum gap time of 10
seconds was used, although many drivers required less time.
During the AM peak one-hour period, 62 two-way gaps of 10 seconds or more were counted. The
majority of gaps that were counted during the AM peak hour were between 10 and 15 seconds long. The
average recorded two-way gap time was approximately 15 seconds. Based on the number and length of
gaps observed, it is estimated that at least 62 vehicles could turn left from McEvoy Street during the AM
peak one-hour period of traffic. Since it is estimated that only 9 AM peak hour vehicles would turn left
from southbound McEvoy Street onto eastbound W. San Carlos Street, a sufficient number of gaps would
exist and no queuing issues are expected to occur during the AM peak one-hour period of the day.



                                                                                              38 | Page

During the PM peak one-hour period, 54 two-way gaps of 10 seconds or more were counted. The
majority of gaps that were counted during the PM peak hour were between 10 and 15 seconds long. The
average recorded two-way gap time was approximately 14 seconds. Based on the number and length of
gaps observed, it is estimated that at least 54 vehicles could turn left from McEvoy Street during the PM
peak one-hour period of traffic. Since it is estimated that only 5 PM peak hour vehicles would turn left
from southbound McEvoy Street onto eastbound W. San Carlos Street, a sufficient number of gaps would
exist and no queuing issues are expected to occur during the PM peak one-hour period of the day.

Signal Warrant
A peak hour signal warrant check (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4, Warrant 3) was performed for the
unsignalized intersection of McEvoy Street and W. San Carlos Street to determine whether signalization
would be justified on the basis of background plus project peak hour traffic volumes, assuming the future
T-intersection configuration. The analysis revealed that the peak hour volume warrant would not be
satisfied at the unsignalized T-intersection during either the AM peak hour or PM peak hour based on
background plus project traffic volumes.
The signal warrant worksheets are included in Appendix E.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
All new development projects in San Jose should encourage multi-modal travel, consistent with the goals
of the City’s General Plan. It is the goal of the General Plan that all development projects accommodate
and encourage the use of non-automobile transportation modes to achieve San Jose’s mobility goals and
reduce vehicle trip generation and vehicle miles traveled. In addition, the adopted City Bike Master Plan
establishes goals, policies and actions to make bicycling a daily part of life in San Jose. The Master Plan
includes designated bike lanes along all City streets, as well as on designated bike corridors. In order to
further the goals of the City, pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be encouraged with new development
projects.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist mostly of sidewalks along the streets in the immediate vicinity of the project
site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are located at all of the signalized
intersections in the study area. There are some segments of roadway (e.g., Auzerais Avenue between
Race Street and Sunol Street, and McEvoy Street between W. San Carlos Street and Park Avenue)
where sidewalks are not continuous or are very narrow. Those roadway segments provide access to
commercial and light industrial uses. Overall, the existing network of sidewalks exhibits good connectivity
and would provide new residents with safe routes to transit services and other points of interest in the
area. The project proposes to install a new crosswalk on W. San Carlos Street at McEvoy Street. This is
described in more detail on page 45. Note that the City’s General Plan identifies the walk commute mode
split target as 15 percent or more for the year 2040.

Bicycle Facilities
Although only two short segments of roadway in the vicinity of the project site include Class II county-
designated bike lanes (Race Street between Auzerais Avenue and Parkmoor Avenue, and Park Avenue
between Sunol Street and Montgomery Street), bicyclists are allowed on any City street, whether or not
there are bike lanes. Bicycles also are allowed on LRT trains and Caltrain. The San Jose Diridon station
is served by Caltrain and is located less than 2,000 feet from the project site.
A connection to the northern segment of the Los Gatos Creek Trail system is located adjacent to the 740
W. San Carlos Street project site with access provided via Dupont Street. The off-street trail begins at
San Carlos Street and extends south. From San Carlos Street, the Guadalupe River multi-use trail system
can be accessed. The Guadalupe River trail system is an 11-mile trail that runs through the City of San
Jose along the Guadalupe River and is shared with pedestrians and separated from motor vehicle traffic.
The Guadalupe River trail is a continuous Class I bikeway from Curtner Avenue in the south to SR 237 in
the north.

                                                                                           39 | Page 
740 & 777 W. San Carlos Street                                                          December 11, 2015 


According to the San Jose Bike Master Plan map, there are plans to connect the short northern segment
of the Los Gatos Creek Trail to the rest of the trail system to the south via new bike lanes and bike routes.
Class II bicycle facilities (striped bike lanes) also are planned along the following roadways in the future:

       Lincoln Avenue, between Malone Road and Park Avenue
       Race Street, between Fruitdale Avenue and San Carlos Street
       Auzerais Avenue, between Meridian Avenue and Woz Way
       Park Avenue, between Market Street and Race Street
The City’s General Plan identifies the bicycle commute mode split target as 15 percent or more for the
year 2040. This calculates to approximately 11 new bicycle trips during both the AM and PM peak hours
for the 740 W. San Carlos Street site, and 12 new bicycle trips during the AM and PM peak hours for the
777 W. San Carlos Street site. This level of bicycle mode share is a reasonable goal for the project.

Transit Services
A new LRT station that is being considered would be located just south of the 740 W. San Carlos Street
project site. The new station platform would be situated along a segment of the existing LRT line that runs
between San Carlos Street and Sunol Street, and would include a new pedestrian crossing and walkway.
An LRT station at this location would benefit the project considerably. The San Jose Diridon Station is
served by LRT trains and provides Caltrain, ACE and Amtrak services. In addition, the existing bus stop
located on W. San Carlos Street at Sunol Street would remain. Thus, it is logical to assume that some
residents would utilize the transit services in the area. Applying a 9 percent transit mode share, which is
the maximum allowed transit reduction per VTA guidelines, equates to a total of approximately 13 new
transit riders between the two project sites during the AM and PM peak hours. However, considering the
convenience of the existing bus stop and potential future LRT station, it is reasonable to assume a
greater transit mode share could be achieved. The City’s General Plan identifies the transit commute
mode split target as 20 percent or more for the year 2040. This calculates to about 30 new transit riders
during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. This level of transit mode share is attainable for a
project such as this, particularly if the new LRT station is built, and is a reasonable goal for the project. It
is estimated that these new riders could be accommodated by the current available capacities of the LRT,
commuter rail, and bus services in the study area.

VTA Light Rail Station Project
The VTA is considering two potential options for upgrading the section of LRT tracks that runs along the
southern boundary of the project site. The first option, which would involve adding a second track
(double-tracking) through this section without adding a station, would not require additional right-of-way
take. The second option would involve adding a new light rail stop near Sunol Street, in addition to
double-tracking. To accomplish this, an additional 9.2 feet of right-of-way would be required. Thus, the
project may be conditioned to dedicate the necessary right-of-way should VTA move forward with the
second option. It appears that the site plan, shown on Figure 11, has already taken this into account. The
project applicant should coordinate with City of San Jose and VTA staff to ensure that the final design of
the mixed-use development does not preclude a potential dedication of right-of-way in the future, should
the VTA decide to construct the station at a later date. VTA staff have indicated that any decision to add
this station would follow the guidance of VTA’s Transit Sustainability Policy & Service Design Guidelines
(TSP/SDG), which were adopted by the VTA Board in February of 2007. These guidelines contain
information about ridership thresholds and other criteria for considering potential service changes. VTA
staff also have indicated that funding for the new station would need to come from non-VTA sources,
such as developer contributions or grant funds. However, a mechanism to collect the necessary funding
has not been established at this time.

Site Access and Circulation – 740 W. San Carlos Street
The site access and circulation evaluation for the 740 W. San Carlos Street site is based on the February
23, 2015 site plan prepared by SGPA Architecture and Planning (see Figure 11). On-site vehicular
circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering standards.

                                                                                             40 | Page 
740 & 777 W. San Carlos Street                                                        December 11, 2015 


Vehicular Site Access
The northbound leg of the McEvoy Street/W. San Carlos Street intersection would be closed off as part of
the project. As a result, Dupont Street would be converted to a one-way street in the eastbound direction
between W. San Carlos Street and the project driveway. Most drivers entering the 740 W. San Carlos
Street site and all drivers exiting the site would do so via Dupont Street under the W. San Carlos Street
overpass. North of the overpass, Dupont Street curves to the west and intersects McEvoy Street. McEvoy
Street provides full access to W. San Carlos Street and Park Avenue. Thus, the majority of project-
generated trips will end up using McEvoy Street, north of W. San Carlos Street, to access the site.
Access to the 740 W. San Carlos Street project site would be provided via one driveway on Dupont
Street. The driveway would be 26 feet wide, measured at the throat, and would provide access to two
garage parking levels. According to the site plan, the parking garage would not be gated. Both parking
levels would serve residents of the development. The at-grade parking level would also serve the small
retail component of the project. In addition, street parking (5 parallel spaces) would be provided on
Dupont Street for use by retail customers and visitors.
The City of San Jose requires that all driveways provide adequate inbound vehicle storage space to avoid
backups onto the City streets. The City typically requires a minimum distance of 50 feet, measured from
the face of curb, in order to provide adequate stacking space for at least two inbound vehicles. The
project driveway would not be gated and would provide approximately 50 feet of inbound stacking space
between Dupont Street and the first on-site parking space. Thus, adequate stacking space for inbound
vehicles would be provided at the project driveway.
The project-generated trips that are estimated to occur at the 740 W. San Carlos Street project driveway
on Dupont Street are 25 inbound trips and 43 outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 46 inbound
trips and 27 outbound trips during the PM peak hour. Vehicle queuing issues are not expected to occur at
the driveway based on the low number of project trips and low traffic volumes on Dupont Street.

Sight Distance
Dupont Street curves approximately 50 feet west of the project driveway. The curve in the road could
make it difficult for drivers exiting the site to see approaching vehicles traveling eastbound on Dupont
Street if there are any obstructions on the west side of the project driveway. The site plan shows a
bioswale with landscaping on either side of the driveway. The landscaping should be low in order to
provide an unobstructed view for drivers exiting the site. The project proposes street trees along the
project frontage, which would not conflict with a driver’s ability to see oncoming traffic. The site plan
shows street parking just east of the project driveway; however, parking would not be permitted
immediately west of the driveway. Assuming that low landscaping would be provided adjacent to the
project driveway, the driveway would be free and clear of obstructions, thereby ensuring that exiting
vehicles could see pedestrians on the sidewalk and vehicles traveling on Dupont Street.
Adequate sight distance (sight distance triangles) should be provided at the project driveway in
accordance with Caltrans standards. Sight distance triangles should be measured approximately 10 feet
back from the traveled way. Appropriate visible warning signs and audible warning signals should be
provided at the parking garage entrance to alert pedestrians and bicyclists of vehicles exiting the garage.
Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway or intersection,
and provides drivers with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic. Sight distance
generally should be provided in accordance with Caltrans standards. The minimum acceptable sight
distance is often considered the Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance requirements vary
depending on the roadway speeds. For driveways on Dupont Street, which is assumed to have a speed
limit of 25 mph, the Caltrans stopping sight distance is 200 feet (based on a design speed of 30 mph).
Thus, a driver must be able to see 200 feet down Dupont Street in order to stop and avoid a collision.
Based on the project site plan, it can be concluded that the project driveway would meet the Caltrans
stopping sight distance standard.




                                                                                            42 | Page

West San Carlos Street Bridge Reconstruction
The West San Carlos Street bridge is slated to be reconstructed in the future; however, a funding strategy
and project commencement timeline have not been identified. If built, the proposed overpass
improvements would significantly affect access to and from the 740 W. San Carlos Street site. Direct site
access to and from W. San Carlos Street would be eliminated. In addition, McEvoy Street would no
longer intersect W. San Carlos Street. As a result, all project-generated traffic would need to access the
site via Dupont Street, and the only way to access Dupont Street would be via Park Avenue. It is
important to note that since the improvements to the West San Carlos Street bridge are part of the City’s
long-range plan, this near-term traffic study does not include an analysis of the roadway network with the
bridge improvements in place.

On-Site Circulation
On-site vehicular circulation was reviewed for the project in accordance with generally accepted traffic
engineering standards.
The project driveway would provide access to 61 parking stalls on the ground level of the parking garage.
The second level of the parking garage would provide 68 parking stalls for residents, for a total of 129
parking stalls. All of the parking stalls on both levels would be 90-degree parking accessed via a two-way
drive aisle measuring 26 feet wide. The site plan shows adequate circulation within the parking garage
with only one dead-end drive aisle on each parking level. Drivers may be required to perform a three-
point maneuver at the dead-end on the ground level. The dead-end aisle on the second parking level
most likely would not create any on-site circulation issues since this area would presumably contain
assigned resident parking spaces.
The City’s standard width for two-way drive aisles is 26 feet wide where 90-degree parking is provided.
This allows sufficient room for vehicles to back out of the parking spaces. The project would meet this City
requirement. Vehicular circulation on both levels of the parking garage would be adequate to serve the
project. However, a convex mirror should be provided at the 45-degree turn on both parking levels.

Parking
Based on the City of San Jose requirements for off-street parking and the 95-unit breakdown being
proposed, the project should provide a total of 149 parking spaces. The City’s parking requirements for
multiple dwellings with all open parking are as follows: 1.25 parking spaces for studio and one-bedroom
units, 1.7 parking spaces for two-bedroom units, and 2.0 parking spaces for three-bedroom units. The
project proposes 10 studios, 29 one-bedroom units, 42 two-bedroom units, and 14 three-bedroom units.
The project proposes to provide a total of 129 parking spaces: 61 stalls on the ground level and 68 stalls
on the second parking level. Based on the City parking code requirements, the project would have a
parking deficit of 20 parking spaces.
The City requires one motorcycle parking space for every four residential units. Thus, the 95-unit project
should provide 24 motorcycle parking spaces. Motorcycle parking is not shown on the site plan so it could
not be evaluated.
The City also requires one bicycle parking space for every four residential units. Thus, the project should
provide 24 bicycle parking spaces. According to the site plan, the project would provide an adequate
amount of bicycle parking in the bike storage area on the ground level.

Parking Stall Dimensions
According to the site plan, all of the 90-degree parking stalls are shown to be 8 ½ feet wide by 17 feet
deep. This meets the City of San Jose off-street parking design standard for uniform car spaces. Van
accessibility is provided at all handicapped stall locations.

Truck Access
The 740 W. San Carlos Street site plan does not show an on-site loading zone. It is assumed, therefore,
that garbage trucks, moving vans, emergency vehicles and large delivery vehicles would perform their

                                                                                          43 | Page

operations outside of the building where adequate vertical clearance would be provided. However, the
site plan does not show a designated loading zone outside of the building either. We recommend that a
loading zone be added on Dupont Street adjacent to the lobby area that could be used by moving and
delivery trucks.
The site plan shows one on-site trash enclosure located near the project driveway. It is assumed that
garbage collection activities would occur outside the building within the public right-of-way on Dupont
Street. In order for this to occur, the trash bins would need to be wheeled out of the garage on garbage
collection days. The project applicant should coordinate with City of San Jose staff to determine the ideal
street location for the trash bins on garbage collection days.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Access and Circulation
The project is proposing to widen the existing sidewalk along its frontage on Dupont Street, as well as
construct new sidewalk along the western boundary of the site. The new sidewalk along the western
boundary of the site would provide a connection to the potential future LRT station platform. The
improvements to the existing narrow sidewalks on Dupont Street would enhance pedestrian safety and
walkability in the immediate vicinity of the project site by bringing the sidewalks up to current City
standards.
The project is also proposing to add a crosswalk to the west leg of the McEvoy Street/W. San Carlos
Street intersection (shown on Figure 11). The crosswalk design should incorporate standard white
crosswalk pavement markings with pedestrian crossing signage to alert motorists to the presence of
pedestrians and to direct pedestrians to a safe crossing location. Additional treatments such as enhanced
warning signs or flashing beacons would probably not be justified on the basis of sight distance, traffic
volume, vehicle speeds, or the anticipated number of pedestrian crossings at this particular location.
Installing ADA compliant ramps and truncated domes also are recommended. Truncated domes are the
standard design requirement for detectable warnings which enable people with visual disabilities to
determine the boundary between the sidewalk and the street.
The project would include a large bike parking area and bike workshop/wash station on the ground floor
level. According to the San Jose Bike Plan 2020 Bikeway Network map, no bicycle facilities are planned
on W. San Carlos Street or Sunol Street.

Site Access and Circulation – 777 W. San Carlos Street
The site access and circulation evaluation for the 777 W. San Carlos Street site is based on the February
23, 2015 site plan prepared by SGPA Architecture and Planning (see Figure 12). On-site vehicular
circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering standards.

Vehicular Site Access
Access to the 777 W. San Carlos Street project site would be provided via one driveway on Sunol Street.
The driveway would be 26 feet wide, measured at the throat, and would provide access to a 7-space
guest and employee parking lot and two residential parking levels. A security gate would separate the
guest and employee parking from the resident parking. Together, the two parking levels would provide
179 parking spaces for residents.
The City of San Jose requires that all driveways provide adequate inbound vehicle storage space to avoid
backups onto the City streets. The City typically requires a minimum distance of 50 feet, measured from
the face of curb, in order to provide adequate stacking space for at least two inbound vehicles. According
to the site plan, the security gate would be located approximately 90 feet from the face of curb. Thus,
adequate stacking space for inbound vehicles would be provided at the project driveway.
The project-generated trips that are estimated to occur at the 777 W. San Carlos Street project driveway
on Sunol Street are 27 inbound trips and 46 outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 50 inbound
trips and 29 outbound trips during the PM peak hour. Vehicle queuing issues are not expected to occur at
the driveway based on the low number of project trips and low traffic volumes on Sunol Street.

Sight Distance
The project proposes street trees along the project frontage, which would not conflict with a driver’s ability
to see oncoming traffic. Parking is not permitted along the east side of Sunol Street. Based on the site
plan provided, the project driveway would be free and clear of obstructions, thereby ensuring that exiting
vehicles could see pedestrians on the sidewalk and vehicles traveling on Sunol Street.
Adequate sight distance (sight distance triangles) should be provided at the project driveway in
accordance with Caltrans standards. Sight distance triangles should be measured approximately 10 feet
back from the traveled way. Appropriate visible warning signs and audible warning signals should be
provided at the parking garage entrance to alert pedestrians and bicyclists of vehicles exiting the garage.
Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway or intersection,
and provides drivers with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic. Sight distance
generally should be provided in accordance with Caltrans standards. The minimum acceptable sight
distance is often considered the Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance requirements vary
depending on the roadway speeds. For driveways on Sunol Street, which has a posted speed limit of 25
mph, the Caltrans stopping sight distance is 200 feet (based on a design speed of 30 mph). Thus, a driver
must be able to see 200 feet down Sunol Street in order to stop and avoid a collision.
Based on the project site plan, it can be concluded that the project driveway would meet the Caltrans
stopping sight distance standard.

On-Site Circulation
On-site vehicular circulation was reviewed for the project in accordance with generally accepted traffic
engineering standards.
The project driveway would provide access to 7 guest and employee parking stalls and 81 gated resident
parking stalls on the ground level of the garage. The second level of the parking garage would provide 98
parking stalls for residents, for a total of 186 parking stalls on-site. All of the parking stalls on both levels
would be 90-degree parking accessed via a two-way drive aisle measuring 26 feet wide.
The site plan shows three dead-end drive aisles on the ground level and four dead-end aisles on parking
level 2. In general, dead-end drive aisles can be problematic if they contain unassigned parking spaces,
since a driver can enter the aisle and upon discovering that there is no available parking must either back
out or conduct a three-point maneuver. All of the dead-end drive aisles would be located within the secure
residential parking areas and most likely would not create any on-site circulation issues since these areas
would presumably contain assigned parking spaces.
The City’s standard width for two-way drive aisles is 26 feet wide where 90-degree parking is provided.
This allows sufficient room for vehicles to back out of the parking spaces. The project would meet this City
requirement. Vehicular circulation on both levels of the parking garage would be adequate to serve the
project.

Parking
Based on the City of San Jose requirements for off-street parking and the 104-unit breakdown being
proposed, the project should provide a total of 185 residential parking spaces. The City’s parking
requirements for multiple dwellings with all open parking are as follows: 1.25 parking spaces for studio
and one-bedroom units, 1.7 parking spaces for two-bedroom units, and 2.0 parking spaces for three-
bedroom units. The project proposes 8 one-bedroom units, 57 two-bedroom units, and 39 three-bedroom
units. The project proposes to provide a total of 179 residential parking spaces: 81 stalls on the ground
level and 98 stalls on the second parking level. Based on the City parking code requirements, the project
would have a parking deficit of 6 parking spaces.
The City requires one motorcycle parking space for every four residential units. Thus, the 104-unit project
should provide 26 motorcycle parking spaces. Motorcycle parking is not shown on the site plan so it could
not be evaluated.


                                                                                               46 | Page

The City also requires one bicycle parking space for every four residential units. Thus, the project should
provide 26 bicycle parking spaces. According to the site plan, the project would provide an adequate
amount of bicycle parking in the two bike parking areas on the ground level.

Parking Stall Dimensions
According to the site plan, all of the 90-degree parking stalls are shown to be 8 ½ feet wide by 17 feet
deep. This meets the City of San Jose off-street parking design standard for uniform car spaces. Van
accessibility is provided at all handicapped stall locations.

Truck Access
The 777 W. San Carlos Street site plan does not show an on-site loading zone. It is assumed, therefore,
that garbage trucks, moving vans, emergency vehicles and large delivery vehicles would perform their
operations outside of the building where adequate vertical clearance would be provided. However, the
site plan does not show a designated loading zone outside of the building either. We recommend that a
loading zone be added on Sunol Street adjacent to the lobby area that could be used by moving and

Pedestrian and Bicycle Access and Circulation
The project is proposing to widen the existing sidewalks along its frontages on W. San Carlos Street and
Sunol Street. The improvements to the existing sidewalks would enhance pedestrian safety and
walkability in the immediate vicinity of the project site by bringing the sidewalks up to current City
standards.
The project would include two large bike parking areas and a bike workshop/wash station on the ground
floor level. According to the San Jose Bike Plan 2020 Bikeway Network map, no bicycle facilities are
planned on W. San Carlos Street or Sunol Street.

Cumulative Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under cumulative conditions.
Cumulative development typically includes projects that are in the pipeline (pending projects) but are not
yet approved. This traffic scenario is evaluated in order to fulfill California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) requirements.
Since the completion of the original Downtown Strategy 2000 EIR, the planned extension of Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART) to San Jose and the High Speed Rail (HSR) project have advanced in their
respective planning stages. Therefore, it was deemed necessary that both the BART extension and HSR
projects be included as part of this cumulative analysis.

Cumulative Traffic Volumes
Cumulative traffic volumes were obtained from the Diridon Station Area Plan (DSAP) EIR for consistency
purposes. Cumulative conditions consist of traffic volumes associated with the approved Downtown
Strategy 2000 and DSAP projects, plus the addition of traffic associated with the BART extension and
HSR projects. In addition, trips associated with the 740 W. San Carlos Street site were added to the
cumulative traffic volumes, since this triangular-shaped parcel was not specifically included as part of the
DSAP, as described below.
The 740 and 777 W. San Carlos Street project sites are both located within the DSAP study area.
However, future development (residential and retail) was only assumed for the 777 W. San Carlos Street
site, not the 740 W. San Carlos Street site. In the DSAP study, the 777 W. San Carlos Street site is made
up of Block D6, which includes 12,000 square feet (s.f.) of retail space and 105 residential units. Since
the proposed 777 W. San Carlos Street project includes 3,150 s.f. of retail space and 104 residential
units, it can be concluded that it is consistent with the level of development assumed in the DSAP study,
as well as the conclusions of the DSAP EIR.

Cumulative Conditions Intersection Levels of Service
The DSAP study analyzed 9 of the 11 intersections that also were analyzed for the 740 and 777 W. San
Carlos Street combined project. The intersections of Sunol Street/Auzerais Avenue and Sunol Street/Park
Avenue were not analyzed in the DSAP study. However, these two intersections are low volume
intersections that currently operate at LOS A (Sunol/Auzerais) and LOS B (Sunol/Park), and would
continue to do so under background plus project conditions. Therefore, analysis of these intersections
under cumulative conditions was deemed unnecessary.
The results of the cumulative intersection level of service analysis show that 4 of the study intersections
are projected to operate at LOS E or F during at least one of the peak hours (see Table 13). The


                                                                                           48 | Page

remaining 5 major intersections are projected to operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the
AM and PM peak hours under cumulative conditions.

Meridian Avenue and San Carlos Street
According to the DSAP EIR, there are no feasible improvements for the Meridian Avenue and San Carlos
Street intersection due to right-of-way restrictions. The EIR indicates that the addition of Strategy 2000-
generated traffic to this intersection (as well as to 16 other intersections identified in the report) would
result in a significant unavoidable impact.
Note that this intersection has been identified as a City of San Jose Protected Intersection. Protected
Intersections consist of locations that have been built to their planned maximum capacity and where
expansion of the intersection would have an adverse effect upon other transportation facilities (such as
pedestrian, bicycle, transit systems, etc.). Protected Intersections are, therefore, not required to maintain
a Level of Service D, which is the City of San Jose standard. The deficiencies at all 25 Protected
Intersections in the City of San Jose have been disclosed and overriden in previous EIRs.


                                                                                            49 | Page

Lincoln Avenue and San Carlos Street
According to the DSAP EIR, there are no feasible improvements for the Lincoln Avenue and San Carlos
Street intersection. The DSAP study recommended that the Lincoln Avenue and San Carlos Street
intersection be added to the City’s Protected Intersection list because it serves as a gateway to the
greater downtown area. This intersection has since been added to the list of Protected Intersections.

Montgomery Street and Park Avenue
The intersection of Montgomery Street and Park Avenue is located in the downtown core and is therefore
exempt from the City’s Level of Service Policy. According to the DSAP EIR, this intersection is projected
to operate below the City LOS standard due to the planned narrowing of Bird Avenue (which transitions
into Montgomery Street) from six to four lanes and Park Avenue from four to two lanes that were
assumed complete under cumulative conditions. The reduction in the number of travel lanes was
proposed as part of the improvements identified in the Ballpark (Baseball Stadium) study.

Bird Avenue and San Carlos Street
Although this intersection is located in the downtown core and is therefore exempt from the City’s Level of
Service Policy, potential intersection improvements were identified for consideration in the DSAP EIR.
The Downtown Strategy 2000 EIR projected this intersection to operate below the City’s LOS standards,
and identified the addition of a second northbound left-turn lane as a potential improvement. The addition
of a second northbound left-turn lane on Bird Avenue was also identified as a potential improvement as
part of the proposed Baseball Stadium. The implementation of the second northbound left-turn lane is
projected to only improve intersection level of service to LOS E. In accordance with CMP conformance
standard, this is an acceptable level of service. The deficient levels at the intersection were identified in
the Strategy 2000 EIR. Operational problems, such as blocked intersections and an imbalance of lane
usage along Bird Avenue between San Carlos Street and I-280, are due to large volumes and the close
spacing of intersections. As such, signal-timing modifications along Bird Avenue between I-280 and San
Carlos Street should be implemented.

Conclusions
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying potential traffic impacts related to two proposed
developments. The combined effects of the 740 and 777 W. San Carlos Street developments were
analyzed together, since the two sites will be developed at approximately the same time by the same
developer. Thus, for the purpose of identifying traffic impacts, the “project” includes a total of 199
residential units and 6,035 s.f. of retail space.
The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the City
of San Jose and the Congestion Management Program (CMP) of Santa Clara County. The study included
the analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions for eleven signalized intersections, one
unsignalized intersection, and seven freeway segments. Project impacts on other transportation facilities,
such as bicycle facilities and transit services, were determined on the basis of engineering judgment.

Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis shows that, measured against the City of San Jose
and CMP level of service impact criteria, none of the study intersections would be significantly impacted
by the project.

Project Freeway Segment Analysis
The results of the freeway segment analysis show that the project would not cause significant increases
in traffic volumes (one percent or more of freeway capacity) on any of the study freeway segments
currently operating at LOS F, and none of the freeway segments currently operating at LOS E or better
would worsen to LOS F as a result of the project. Therefore, based on CMP freeway impact criteria, none
of the study freeway segments would be significantly impacted by the project.

Individual vs. Combined Effects of the Developments
The results of the traffic analysis show that development of both sites simultaneously would not result in
any significant traffic impacts. Therefore, should development of one site move forward and not the other,
the results of the analysis would be the same.

Other Transportation Facilities
The proposed project would be a higher density transit-oriented development located within close
proximity to LRT, local bus, Caltrain, Amtrak, and ACE transit services, and will be consistent with the
San Jose General Plan multi-modal transportation policies to collectively provide a safe, efficient, and
environmentally sensitive transportation system for the movement of people and goods.

                                                                                          51 | Page

Site access and on-site circulation would be adequate to serve both the 740 W. San Carlos Street site
and the 777 W. San Carlos Street site.

740 W. San Carlos Street Site Recommendations
       A convex mirror should be provided at the 45-degree turn on both parking levels.
       Based on the City’s parking requirements, the project would have a parking deficit. The project
        applicant should coordinate with City staff to verify the adequacy of parking provided on-site.
       The site plan does not show any loading zones. We recommend that a loading zone be added on
        Dupont Street adjacent to the lobby area that could be used by moving trucks and delivery trucks.

777 W. San Carlos Street Site Recommendations
       Based on the City’s parking requirements, the project would have a small parking deficit. The
        project applicant should coordinate with City staff to verify the adequacy of parking provided on-
        site.
       The site plan does not show any loading zones. We recommend that a loading zone be added on
        Sunol Street adjacent to the lobby area that could be used by moving trucks and delivery trucks.

Cumulative Conditions
Cumulative traffic volumes were obtained from the Diridon Station Area Plan (DSAP) EIR for consistency
purposes. Cumulative conditions consist of traffic volumes associated with the approved Downtown
Strategy 2000 and DSAP projects, plus the addition of traffic associated with the BART extension and
High Speed Rail projects, plus traffic generated by the proposed 740 W. San Carlos Street project, since
this triangular-shaped parcel was not included in the DSAP study.
The results of the cumulative intersection level of service analysis show that the proposed project (740
and 777 W. San Carlos Street sites) is consistent with the conclusions of the DSAP EIR.
