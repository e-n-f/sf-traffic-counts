Existing Peak Hour Conditions
Peak hour traffic volumes represent the highest hourly volume of vehicles passing through an intersection
during a typical 4-6 PM weekday peak period. Peak period turning movement counts during the PM peak
hour at the study intersections was conducted in March 2017 by Idax Data Solutions. Figure 3 summarizes
existing PM peak period turning movements at the study intersections. Attachment A contains data sheets.

Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service (LOS) analyses were conducted at the study intersections during the weekday
PM peak hour of existing conditions and with and without project traffic generated at full buildout of The
Bicycle Apartments project. LOS refers to the degree of congestion on a roadway or intersection. It is a
measure of vehicle operating speed, travel time, travel delays, and driving comfort. A letter scale from A to
F generally describes LOS.

At signalized intersections, LOS A represents free-flow conditions-motorists experience little or no delays,
and LOS F represents forced-flow conditions-motorists experience an average delay in excess of 80
seconds per vehicle. The LOS reported for signalized intersections represents the average control delay per
vehicle entering the intersection. The LOS reported at stop-controlled intersections is also based on the
average control delay (sec/veh) and is reported for each movement. Therefore, the reported LOS at
unsignalized intersections does not represent a measure of the overall operations of the intersection.

LOS calculations for both signalized and stop-controlled intersections were calculated using the
methodologies and procedures outlined in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Special Report
209, Transportation Research Board (TRB). Table 1 outlines the LOS criteria for signalized and
unsignalized intersections based on these methodologies. The City of Yakima maintains a level of service
standard of LOS D. Existing PM peak hour LOS analyses are summarized in Table 2. As shown under
2017 existing conditions during the PM peak hour, all signalized intersections currently operate at LOS D
or better and stop-controlled movements at unsignalized intersections currently operate at LOS D or better.
Detailed LOS summary worksheets are included in Attachment B.

Public Transportation Services and Nonmotorized Facilities
Yakima Transit provides transit stops on Summitview Avenue for westbound and eastbound travel on the
northwest and southeast corners of the N 50th Avenue and Summitview Avenue intersection, north of the
project site. Both transit stops are located within 700 feet of the project site. Adequate sidewalks are
provided on N 50th Avenue and Summitview Avenue to and from the project site and these transit stop
locations.

Planned Transportation Improvements
A list of capital improvement projects was provided by the City of Yakima and was reviewed for planned
transportation improvements that would provide increased traffic capacity for future growth within the
immediate vicinity of the site. No planned improvements were identified in the immediate site vicinity.

The following planned transportation improvements have been identified in the City of YakimaÊs 2040
Transportation System Plan (DRAFT Transportation Improvement Projects):

     Project I-10: 40th Ave / Summitview Avenue Intersection Improvements. Improve the intersection
      by constructing larger corner radii, lengthening the turn lanes and upgrading the traffic signal
      system. Project may change based on 40th Avenue Access Management Corridor Study findings.
      Identified in the CityÊs 6-year 2017-2022 Transportation Improvement Program. Estimated cost -
      $1,093,000. Medium-range timeframe (2021-2030).
     Project R-21: 48th Avenue Widening from Summitview Ave to Nob Hill Road. Reconstruct and
      widen 48th Avenue, install curb, gutter, sidewalk, street lighting and drainage system. Identified in
      the CityÊs 6-year 2017-2022 Transportation Improvement Program. Estimated cost - $2,575,000.
      Medium-range timeframe (2021-2030).

Traffic Impact Analysis
The following section describes projected future baseline traffic growth, new trips generated by the proposed
development, distribution of new project trips, intersection level of service impacts, a parking impact
analysis, site access and circulation issues, and identification of transportation mitigation to offset impacts.


2019 Baseline Traffic Volumes
The expected completion/occupancy year for this project is 2019. To estimate 2019 baseline traffic
volumes without the project, 2017 traffic counts were factored by 2.5 percent per year per the City of
YakimaÊs annual traffic growth rate. Per the City of Yakima, there are no known pipeline development
projects in the project site vicinity.

Project Trip Generation
Trip generation rates compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Trip Generation
Manual, 9th Edition, 2012, were used to estimate new daily traffic and PM peak hour traffic. Average
rate equations for ITE land use codes for the new land use of 220 Apartments were applied for 80
proposed apartment units.

Project Trip Distribution
To distribute trips onto the vicinity-street and the arterial network, trip distribution patterns were determined
based on review of existing travel patterns, and the relative distribution of schools, employment centers, and
commercial density in the vicinity.

Generally, average distribution and assignment of project trips was assumed as (as illustrated in Figure 4):
     25 percent north via N 40th Avenue and N 56th Avenue.
     35 percent west via Summitview Avenue, W Chestnut Avenue and Tieton Drive.
     15 percent east via Summitview Avenue.
     25 percent southeast via N 40th Avenue, N 48th Avenue and W Chestnut Avenue.

Figure 5 summarizes traffic volume impacts of the proposed The Bicycle Apartments project during the PM
peak hour in 2019. Weekday PM peak traffic volumes forecasts with and without the project in 2019 are
provided in Attachment D.


Intersection Level of Service Impacts
Estimated project intersection LOS impacts during the PM peak hour in 2019 with and without the project
are summarized in Table 5. Detailed LOS summary worksheets for future 2019 conditions with and without
the project are included in Attachment B.

As shown under 2019 conditions in Table 5, with and without the project during the PM peak hour, all
signalized intersections and all stop-controlled movements at unsignalized intersections would operate at
LOS D or better, meeting adopted level of service standards.

N 50th Avenue Cul-De-Sac Traffic Impact Analysis

The City of Yakima requested an analysis of traffic impacts be conducted of constructing a cul-de-sac onto
N 50th Avenue to prevent through traffic onto W Chestnut Avenue. Based upon the City of YakimaÊs
Municipal Code Title 12.06.050 Cul-de-sac Streets, cul-de-sacs shall be constructed within a street-right of-
way of 80 feet in diameter and have an improved diameter of 65 feet. In addition, the maximum length of
a cul-de-sac street shall be six hundred feet measured along the street centerline from the nearest through
street intersection to the center of the cul-de-sac.

To meet the City of YakimaÊs cul-de-sac street requirements, a cul-de-sac would need to be constructed in
the vicinity of N 50th Avenue and Pear Tree Court, approximately 600 feet north of the street centerline for
W Chestnut Avenue. This location, however would be more than 700 feet from Summitview Avenue, and
therefore, would exceed the CityÊs maximum standard to provide for safe fire/emergency vehicle
circulation. In addition, installation of this type of treatment at an optimal location would require purchase
of existing residential properties to construct, and therefore, construction of such a measure would not
appear viable without violating City code/design standards.

Regardless a traffic operational analysis of this cul-de-sac scenario, all project trips were redistributed to the
north onto Intersection #2 - N 50th Avenue / Summitview Avenue under 2019 conditions with the
proposed development. In addition, existing trips that travel Summitview for residences south of the cul-de-
sac were removed from the intersection as they would now be forced to take Chestnut Avenue. As shown
in Attachment E, minor street approaches would continue to operate at LOS D assuming a cul-de-sac.


Parking Impact Analysis
The Bicycle Apartments development proposes to provide 120 off-street parking stalls. On-street parking is
also available on N 50th Avenue.

A parking impact analysis was conducted to evaluate parking demand that would be generated by the
proposed project. The parking impact analysis reviewed:
     City of Yakima parking requirements.
     Parking demand of proposed commercial development using ITE rates.
     Existing parking inventory for similar Next Step Housing developments.


City of Yakima Parking Requirements

Based upon the City of Yakima off-street parking standards (Yakima Municipal Code Title 15.06.040,
Table 6-1 Table of Off-Street Parking Standards), Table 6 summarizes the minimum off-street parking stalls
required by the proposed development. As shown, the City of Yakima would require 120 off-street parking
stalls.

Project Parking Demand

For the project, the Institute of Transportation Engineers Parking Generation, Fourth Edition, 2010, was used
to determine parking demand for The Bicycle Apartments development. Based upon Land Use Code 221
for Low-Rise/Mid-Rise Apartments, direct application of published rates in Parking Generation, 4th Edition,
estimate the peak development parking demand at a total of 76 parking stalls (see Table 7).

      1 - Parking Generation Manual,   4th   Edition, ITE, 2010.

Based on other similar residential developments for Next Step Housing, a parking inventory was
determined to be 67 percent of total residential units. Application of this local demand, The Bicycle
Apartments development is anticipated to have a parking demand of 54 stalls.

Parking Impacts

The Bicycle Apartments development proposes to provide 120 off-street parking stalls, meeting the minimum
required under code. Additionally, parking demand based upon ITE Parking Generation rates and parking
inventory for similar Next Step Housing developments indicate parking demand for the project is estimated
to range between 54 to 76 parking stalls, approximately 45 to 63 percent less than the 120 proposed off-
street parking stalls. Therefore, no parking impacts off-site are anticipated by the proposed development.


Site Access and Circulation Issues
Vehicular site access would be provided onto N 50th Avenue. The internal roadway within the
development would provide adequate on-site, two-way circulation with curbs, gutters and sidewalks on
both sides of the existing street frontage. The CityÊs engineering and development code applies the
International Fire Code (IFC) for secondary emergency vehicle access requirements for residential
development. As the proposed project is less than 100 units, a secondary access is not required per IFC
Appendix D, Section D106 Multifamily Residential Developments.

Field work was conducted by TENW on March 25, 2017, along N 50th Avenue. Driver entering sight
distance via the project site driveway onto N 50th Avenue is greater than 600 feet to the north and greater
than 800 feet to the south. Based upon WSDOTÊs Exhibit 1310-19a Sight Distance at Intersections, 330
feet of sight distance is required for entering a roadway with a 30 mph design speed (5 mph over 25 mph
posted speed). As such, adequate visibility for safe egress would be provided.

Regardless of the IFC standards, the City of Yakima requested a review of other potential secondary access
requirements. As shown in Figure 6, additional secondary access for fire/emergency purposes could only
be provided onto parking lots within adjacent commercial properties, however, these locations would not
be viable as they would directly impact viable building sites for proposed residential units.

Project Mitigation
A review of traffic impacts to intersection levels of service, parking impact analysis, site access and
circulation issues was conducted in association with The Bicycle Apartments project, a proposed new
development of 80 apartments in Yakima, WA.

Based upon this transportation impact analysis, the following mitigation measures may be required:
     The proposed development will need to go through a traffic concurrency review process to
      determine the projectÊs traffic impact fees, which is anticipated to generate 50 new project trips
      based upon 80 new apartment units.
     Adequate on-site parking would be provided, meeting both City code and expected on-site
      demand.
     The applicant may be required to dedicate right-of-way along the property frontage onto N 50th
      Avenue.
