                 Traffic Impact Analysis



Reference:             Berkeley Honda Supplemental Traffic Analysis


In response to Berkeley Honda’s request, Stantec prepared the traffic impact study (dated
September 22, 2015) for the proposed Berkeley Honda, a full-service auto dealership with service
and parts departments, at 2777 Shattuck Avenue and 2747 Adeline Street in the City of Berkeley.
Based on some public comments, a few additional issues/concerns were raised. This memo
summarizes the issues and responses based on additional analysis for the proposed project.

Accident at or near the intersection and proposed driveway location

Accident History
Stantec gathered the accident history for the most recent 5-year (2011-2015) period from the
Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) for the following two intersections near the
proposed project site:
    • The intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Ward Street
    • The intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Stuart Street

Table 1 shows the number of accidents occurred at each intersection by the type of accidents.
As shown, there were two (2) reported accidents at/near the intersection of Shattuck Avenue
and Ward Street and there are 14 accidents reported at/near the intersection of Shattuck
Avenue and Stuart Street.

Details on the accident types and other accident related information are included in Appendix
A. As shown in Appendix A, at the intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Ward Street:
    • The two (2) sideswipe accidents were due to improper lane changing on the
         southbound Shattuck Avenue and improper backing up on Ward Street.

    •   The three (3) sideswipe accidents were due to pedestrian violation crossing Shattuck.
        Avenue, improper parking maneuver on Stuart Street and conflicts between
        southbound vehicle on Shattuck Avenue and vehicle from westbound Stuart Street.
    •   The seven (7) broadside accidents were due to conflicts between
        northbound/southbound vehicles on Shattuck Avenue and eastbound/westbound
        vehicles/bicyclists from Stuart Street and conflict between eastbound vehicle and
        pedestrian crossing Stuart Street.
    •   The two (2) rear-end accidents were due to improper speed on northbound Shattuck
        Avenue.
    •   The two (2) head-on accidents were both caused due to the influence of alcohol.

The proposed Berkeley Honda driveway would be located approximately 60 feet south of Ward
Street on the east side of Shattuck Avenue, which would provide both inbound and outbound
(right-turn only) access. Due to relatively low speed on Shattuck Avenue (25 mph) near the
proposed driveway and the fact that the southbound left-turn inbound vehicles only need to
cross one northbound through lane on Shattuck Avenue, it is expected that the potential to
have such accident at the proposed driveway to Berkeley Honda would be low. Moreover, the
number of vehicles accessing the driveway from the southbound Shattuck Avenue direction is
expected to be low – six (6) vehicles during the a.m. peak hour and four (4) vehicles during the
p.m. peak hour.

Queuing and Operation
We selected the left-turn into the driveway of the new Safeway on College Avenue, just south of
Alcatraz Street for its similar geometry and lane configuration to the proposed driveway for
Berkeley Honda. We collected traffic data and observed traffic operations and queuing on the
left turn lane. Overall, as expected the full-service grocery store, Safeway, generates
substantially more trips than expected from Berkeley Honda.

On a typical Thursday, May 26, 2016, Stantec observed queuing and traffic operations at the
Safeway driveway location near the intersection of College Avenue and Alcatraz Avenue
during the morning (7:00 a.m. – 9:00 a.m.) and afternoon (4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.) peak periods.
The proposed lane configuration of the entrance driveway for Berkeley Honda project would be
similar to the entrance driveway for the Safeway, which is expected to generate more traffic
than is expected from the Honda dealership.

Based on the observation, the longest southbound left-turn queue for vehicles entering the
Safeway driveway was only two (2) vehicles. This queue did not extend or block the southbound
through lane on College Avenue, during either the morning or the afternoon peak periods.

Table 2 compares the intersection turning movement volumes from/to the Safeway driveway
with those expected from/to the proposed Berkeley Honda driveway. As shown, there are
significantly less inbound and outbound trips expected at the proposed Berkeley Honda
driveway, compared with those at the existing Safeway driveway during both the morning and
the afternoon peak hours.

Appendix A includes more details of the turning movement volumes at the Safeway driveway.
As shown, the northbound/southbound through traffic volumes on College Avenue near the
Safeway driveway are similar to the through volumes on Shattuck Avenue near the proposed
Berkeley Honda driveway.

 Shattuck Ave

Therefore, it would be expected that the conflicts between the northbound through traffic on
Shattuck Avenue and the southbound left-turn vehicles entering the proposed Berkeley Honda
project driveway would not develop a queue of more than two (2) vehicles on the proposed
southbound left turn lane. Therefore, the queueing at the driveway, if any, would not extend
long enough to block the southbound through traffic on Shattuck Avenue.

Number of cars coming In and out of the service area per day
Stantec confirmed with the Project Sponsor that typically there would be approximately 30 to 35
cars that are serviced per day. This number matches with the trip generation analysis prepared
for the project (dated September 22, 2015).

How will tow trucks get in and out of the service department
Stantec confirmed with the Project Sponsor that typically there are either one (1) or two (2) tow
trucks per day that is expected at the proposed project site. The tow trucks will unload inside the
building in the service department, which would cause no conflict with traffic on Shattuck
Avenue.

How would the parts be delivered
Stantec confirmed with the Project Sponsor that parts are delivered once a day during the off
peak periods, i.e. outside the windows of morning/evening peaks. The delivery truck would stop
on Adeline Street and the parts trolley would be rolled across the street into the project site.
Delivery truck would not be able to pull into the Honda driveway, but will stop only at the
designated location on Adeline Street north of the existing curb cut as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 illustrates the AutoTurn analysis for the proposed truck delivery location to identify if parts
delivery would adversely impact the bus operations near the bus stop location on Adeline
Street. As shown, when a truck is parked on the proposed delivery location on Adeline Street
immediately north of the existing curb-cut, buses could turn in and out of the bus stop south of
the curb-cut with minimal disruptions to traffic circulation along northbound Adeline Street. There
is sufficient space for the bus to maneuver in and out of the bus stop even when the truck is
parked at the designated location.

How does the proposed driveway curb-cut on Shattuck Avenue fit into the pedestrian oriented
neighborhood
Stantec conduct pedestrian counts at the sidewalk location where the curb cut is proposed for
Berkeley Honda on a typical Thursday, May 26, 2016, during morning (7:00 a.m. – 9:00 a.m.),
noon (11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m.), afternoon (4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.) and evening (7:30 p.m. – 9:00
p.m.) peak periods. Table 3 shows the pedestrian counts during each peak hour.

Table 3 Peak Hour Pedestrian Counts at the Sidewalk near the Proposed Curb Cut
   A.M. Peak Hour          Noon Peak Hour           P.M. Peak Hour       Evening Peak Hour
          29                     95                        79                    61

As shown, there are currently approximately 29, 95, 79 and 61 pedestrians using the sidewalk at
the proposed curb cut for Berkeley Honda during the morning, noon, afternoon and evening
peak hour, respectively.

The pedestrians’ use of the sidewalk at the proposed curb cut is minimal during the morning
peak period compared with the other peak periods of the day. It is expected that the proposed
Berkeley Honda driveway would generate more service related trips entering the driveway
during the morning peak period as compared with the other peak periods of the day. As shown
in Table 2, during the morning peak hour, there would be a total of 6 inbound and 6 outbound
trips using the proposed project driveway, which might bring in potential conflicts with the
existing 29 pedestrians using the sidewalk where the proposed driveway would be located. This
traffic volume equals to approximately one pedestrian using the sidewalk near the proposed
curb cut every two minutes and one inbound or outbound trip every five minutes using the
Berkeley Honda driveway. It is expected that the probability of potential conflicts between
pedestrians and vehicles at the proposed driveway location would be low during the a.m. peak.
During the afternoon peak period and noon peak period, there would be a potential conflict
between the vehicles exiting the proposed driveway with the pedestrians on the sidewalk.

The Project Sponsor will install “Driveway Alarm System” at the driveway that would notify
pedestrians of on-coming vehicles out of the driveway. This would be based on automated
vehicle detection that would trigger the alarm to warn the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The curb
cut would be designed narrower than the regular curb-cut and the Project Sponsor would work
with City staff to design a pedestrian-friendly curb-cut.

In order to reduce pedestrian-vehicle conflict at the driveway, Stantec recommends installing
additional safety measures, which include, but not limited to, bells/horns at the driveway, or a
“multi-media device that includes audio and visual – both of which could be sensitive to
ambient noise or light and, therefore, minimize possible annoyance with residents or merchants.

Pedestrian Friendly Driveway Design
Project Sponsor will work with City staff to recommend a pedestrian friendly driveway design and
work with the project architect to modify the driveway design. One design feature that the City
of Berkeley requires of downtown is the provision of a minimum 5’ by 5’ sight distance triangle so
exiting motorists can have an improved opportunity to see pedestrians on the sidewalk and vice
versa.
