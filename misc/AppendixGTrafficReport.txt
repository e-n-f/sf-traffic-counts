Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Oracle Educational Facility
(project) on the Oracle Headquarters campus in Redwood City, California. The 4.34-acre project site includes a
surface parking lot with 74 spaces for the Conference Center event, a parking area with approximately 14 spaces
for the Bay Trail users, and undeveloped land. The project would build a two-story 64,000 square-foot building
that would house a new Design Tech High School (Design Tech) with a capacity for 550 students and 30 full-time
staff. Design Tech is a public high school currently authorized by the San Mateo Union High School District. For
the 2015/16 school year, the school leases spaces at the San Mateo County Office of Education Regional
Occupation Program at 1800 Rollins Road, Burlingame, California. The school currently has 262 9th and 10th
grade students and 23 staff and is adding one grade level per year. Design Tech has a no driving/parking policy
for students and would implement the same policy at the project site. The project site would have a 35-space
parking lot for staff and visitors. A small number of parking spaces in this lot would be reserved for students
participating in internships on a schedule where transit is not an option. The project would include a student drop-
off loop with a capacity of 24 vehicles along the back side of the parking lot. Student drop-off and pick-up would
be monitored by staff. Oracle, Bridge Park, and Clipper shuttles, which provide connection to the Hillsdale and
San Carlos Caltrain Stations and the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station, would be made available to students and
staff. The project would also extend the exiting turn out to the east of the school to accommodate 14 additional
parking spaces for trail users.
The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the Cities of
Redwood City and Belmont and the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG). The C/CAG administers
the San Mateo County Congestion Management Program (CMP). The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM
peak-hour levels of service for ten intersections. The traffic analysis also includes an evaluation of potential
impacts to bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities and a review of site access, on-site circulation, drop-off and
pick-up operations, and parking.

Project Trip Estimates
Trip generation for the proposed Oracle Educational Facility was estimated based on the existing student
residences (zip code data), travel patterns and mode choices observed at the existing Design Tech High School
and the proposed numbers of students and staff/teachers at the project site. Peak-hour vehicle trips are
anticipated to be generated by vehicles dropping off and picking up students, students with internships that drive
to school, and staff and teachers.
Design Tech has a no driving/parking policy for students; therefore, although the school attracts students from the
entire Bay Area, about 60% of existing students take Caltrain and BART to school. The project site on the Oracle
campus is located near the Belmont Caltrain Station (1.5 miles). Shuttle services between the Oracle campus and
the Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations and the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station would be made available to
its students and staff. Additionally, Design Tech would continue to implement the no driving/parking policy at the
project site. Therefore, it is expected that a similar percentage of students would take Caltrain and BART after the
school moves to the project site.

Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                              December 14, 2015


Percentages of students that would come to the school by transit, vehicles (driven by parents), and bicycles were
estimated based on the residence locations of existing students. Based on the zip code data, the mode choice
assumptions for students are summarized below:

       Drop-off by cars: 36%;
       Transit: 61%;
       Bicycle: 3%.
Vehicle trips associated with students that would be driven to school were estimated assuming a vehicle
occupancy rate of 1.5 students per vehicle. Consistent with data provided from the existing Design Tech, it was
assumed that about 30% of students would participate in after school programs that end at 4:15 PM. Only those
students would generate trips during PM peak hour (4 – 5 PM).
In addition to the drop-off trips, students that participate in internships would also generate vehicle trips.
Depending on the internship locations and schedule, some of the students may not be able to take transit and
would need to drive to school.
About 50% of staff/teachers currently drive to school. The driving percentage for staff is higher than for students
because staff/teachers may live closer to school and on-site parking would be provided. The percentage was
assumed to be same at the project site. All teachers and staff were assumed to arrive and depart within the AM
and PM peak commute periods.
In the AM peak hour, the project is expected to generate a total of 289 new trips, with 162 inbound trips and 127
outbound trips. In the PM peak hour, the project is expected to generate a total of 111 new trips, with 38 inbound
trips and 73 outbound trips.
Although Design Tech already has a relatively high percentage of students taking transit, it will implement TDM
measures to encourage more students and employees to carpool, take transit, or use active modes of transport to
get to and from school. To be conservative, this report assumes the existing mode split will continue with no
additional trip reductions from the TDM measures.

Traffic Operations at Study Intersections
Traffic operations at the study intersections were evaluated using TRAFFIX software to determine level of service.
The Cities of Redwood City and Belmont level of service methodologies for signalized and unsignalized
intersections are both the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method. Traffic impacts were analyzed for the
AM (7-9 AM) and PM (4-6 PM) peak periods of commute traffic. The intersection level of service analysis results
are presented in Tables ES-1. Based on the Cities of Redwood City and Belmont level of service standards and
impact criteria, the project would not generate a significant impact at study intersections under all the project
conditions.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
The site access and circulation review is based on the project site plan prepared by DES Architects + Engineers
on October 30, 2015. The site access and circulation were evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site’s
driveways with regard to traffic volumes, delays, vehicle queues, geometric design, sight distance, and truck
access. The parking lot and drop-off loop would be served by two one-way driveways. Traffic would enter at the
east driveway (inbound) and exit through the west driveway (outbound), which would be located directly opposite
Oracle Street #1. In general, the site plan shows adequate site access and internal circulation.
Vehicles entering the parking lot and drop-off loop would be restricted to right turns only to avoid delays
associated with uncontrolled inbound left-turn movements. At the outbound driveway, vehicles would be permitted
to turn left onto eastbound Oracle Parkway or right onto westbound Oracle Parkway. The outbound driveway
intersection would operate under all-way stop control. Project traffic entering and exiting the site would not
significantly affect intersection operations or cause back-ups on Oracle Parkway. However, the following measure
is recommended to facilitate traffic operations during drop-off and pick-up.


                                                                                                        Page | ii
Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                                 December 14, 2015


    Recommendation 1 – Designate staff to control the drop-off/pick-up traffic. Staff should guide entering
                       vehicles at the inbound driveway to prevent blockage of through traffic on Oracle
                       Parkway and prevent drop-off and pick-up outside of the drop-off area.
Although Design Tech staff would monitor drop-off and pick-up operations, Recommendation 1 described above
should be implemented to ensure that vehicles do not turn left into the inbound driveway, minimize any vehicle
queues that may develop during drop-off/pick-up periods, and manage conflicts between vehicles and
pedestrians.
Additionally, the proposed TDM strategies are expected to encourage more students to take transit and carpool
and reduce the vehicle trips generated by the students thereby reducing the length of queue storage needed for
drop-off and pick-up operations.

Potential Impacts on Pedestrians, Bicycles, and Transit
In summary, the project is well served by the existing pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities. The project would
not result in changes to the existing pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities. The project would increase vehicle
traffic across the existing bike lanes at project driveways on Oracle Parkway and at the Oracle Parkway/Marine
Parkway intersection and would increase usage of the existing bike and pedestrian facilities. However, the
existing facilities are adequate to meet the increased demand without any improvements. Therefore, there would
be no impacts to these facilities.
Sidewalks would be provided along the project street frontage that connect to the crosswalks at adjacent
intersections. A sidewalk also would be provided adjacent to the student drop-off loop that connects to the Bay
Trail and the project building. Design Tech would have joint use of the fitness center and conference center in the
Oracle Campus. Student access for these facilities would be provided via the sidewalks along the project frontage
and the crosswalks at the Oracle Street #1/Oracle Parkway and Oracle Street #2/Oracle Parkway intersections.
Both intersections are all-way stop-controlled. At the Oracle Street #1/Oracle Parkway intersection, a crosswalk
exists on the east leg, but there is no crosswalk on the south leg for students accessing the fitness center. The
following measure is recommended to enhance the safety of students walking to and from the fitness center.
    Recommendation 2 – Provide a crosswalk on the south leg of the Oracle Street #1/Oracle Parkway
                       intersection.
Although few students are expected to access the school via the crosswalk at the Oracle Street #1/Oracle
Parkway during drop-off and pick-up, implementation of Recommendation 1 would ensure that vehicles obey safe
loading practices.
As show on Figure 12, new crosswalks would be provided at the parking lot driveways. However, the crosswalk at
the inbound driveway would be set back from the street, which would make it more difficult for vehicles entering
the driveway to see pedestrians in the crosswalk. The following measure is recommended to improve the
pedestrian safety during crossing.
    Recommendation 3 – Move the crosswalk at the inbound driveway closer to the travel lanes on Oracle
                       Parkway.
Bicycle facilities within typical biking distance of the project site are well provided by the Bay Trail, bike lanes on
Oracle Parkway and Marine Parkway, and a bike connection between the project site and the Belmont Caltrain
Station. The project would also improve the section of Bay Trail behind project site. However, because the bike
connection between the project site and the Belmont Caltrain Station via City streets and the Bay Trail is
circuitous, the following measure is recommended to direct students and staff to the school.
    Recommendation 4 – Work with the City to identify appropriate locations for wayfinding signage along City
                       streets and/or the Bay Trail between the project site and the Belmont Caltrain Station.
Transit in the project vicinity is provided by SamTrans buses, Caltrain/SamTrans shuttles, and Oracle shuttle
programs. SamTrans buses run on Marine Parkway with the nearest bus stops located at the east Oracle
Parkway/Marine Parkway intersection, about 0.4 miles to the project site. A continuous pedestrian path is
available via crosswalks, sidewalks, and the Bay Trail between the school and the nearest bus stops. Caltrain

                                                                                                           Page | iii
Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                                December 14, 2015


shuttles that run between the Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations and the Oracle campus include the
Oracle Shuttle, Bridge Park Shuttle, and Clipper Shuttle. These shuttles would be made available to students and
staff of the school with a dedicated drop-off area provided in the parking lot. In addition, Oracle offers employee
shuttle programs to the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station, and the Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations. The
school also proposes to purchase a van to transport students and staff to and from the Belmont Caltrain Station
around midday so that they can participate in concurrent college enrollment and internships.

Parking Demand and Supply
The school proposes to provide 59 on-site parking spaces, including 35 spaces in the parking lot and 24 spaces
in the student drop-off area. Based on the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance, the project would be required to
provide 320 spaces. The required parking includes 275 spaces for 11th and 12th grade students (one required
space per student). Because the school has a no driving/parking policy for students in all grades, the parking lot
would only be used by staff, visitors, and a small number of students who participate in internships on a schedule
where transit is not an option. Based on the mode share of the existing staff, it is expected that about 50% of
staff/teachers (about 15 staff) would drive to school. Approximately 20 students in grades 11 and 12 may
participate in internships. While most student interns are expected to take transit and/or walk to and from their
work site, some student interns may be permitted to drive if their schedule or work location makes transit
infeasible. The total parking demand for the staff and student interns who drive is not expected to exceed the
parking supply of 35 spaces. Additionally, the school’s TDM strategies are expected to encourage more school
staff and students to take transit and carpool and further reduce the parking demand. Therefore, the parking lot is
expected to meet the proposed parking demand.
The project would include a bike corral with up to 28 bicycle parking spaces. Based on the Redwood City Zoning
Ordinance, the proposed parking supply of 28 spaces fulfills the zoning code requirements of 13 spaces. It is
anticipated that about 3% of students would ride bicycles to school, which would be 17 students. The provided
bicycle parking spaces would be sufficient to accommodate these students.
The project would remove the existing parking lot at the project site. There are a total of 74 spaces in the parking
lot plus 14 stalls on Oracle Parkway for the trail users. According to the City staff, the existing parking lot provides
excess parking spaces above that required for the Conference Center. The parking requirement is already
satisfied within the exiting parking structures. Therefore, the removal of the excess spaces is not expected to
cause an overall parking shortage within the Oracle campus. The project would replace the existing Bay Trail
spaces on Oracle Parkway by extending the existing turn out east of the school to accommodate 14 additional
parking spaces.

TDM Measures
Design Tech will implement TDM measures for the project to encourage more students and employees to
carpool, take transit, or use active modes of transport to get to and from school. The TDM measures are expected
to reduce vehicle trips, vehicle queuing during drop-off and pick-up, and parking demand. The project is expected
to generate 289 AM peak-hour trips and with the proposed TDM measures, 151 peak-hour trip credits are
estimated per C/CAG guidelines. According to C/CAG guidelines, the project is required to reduce the demand for
all new peak-hour trips generated by the school. However, many of the TDM measures listed in the C/CAG
guidelines are not applicable to the school and the school already has a relatively high percentage of students
taking transit. Thus, it is infeasible to mitigate every peak-hour trip generated by the project. It should be noted
that while the trips generated by the school would be new to the roadways immediately adjacent to the project
site, in a regional context, the Design Tech school trips are merely reassigned trips from other schools in the area
where the students would have otherwise attended.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Oracle Educational Facility
(project) on the Oracle Headquarters campus in Redwood City, California. The 4.34-acre project site includes a
surface parking lot with 74 spaces for the Conference Center event, a parking area with approximately 14 spaces
for the Bay Trail users, and undeveloped land. The project would construct build a two-story 64,000 square-foot
building that would house a new Design Tech High School (Design Tech) with a capacity for 550 students and 30
full-time staff. Design Tech is a public high school currently authorized by the San Mateo Union High School
District. For the 2015/16 school year, the school leases spaces at the San Mateo County Office of Education
Regional Occupation Program at 1800 Rollins Road, Burlingame, California. The school currently has 262 9th and
10th grade students and 23 staff and is adding one grade level per year. Design Tech has a no driving/parking
policy for students and would implement the same policy at the project site. The project site would have a 35-
space parking lot for staff and visitors. A small number of parking spaces in this lot would be reserved for students
participating in internships on a schedule where transit is not an option. The project would include a student drop-
off loop with the capacity of 24 vehicles along the back side of the parking lot. Student drop-off and pick-up would
be monitored by staff. Oracle, Bridge Park, and Clipper shuttles, which provide connection to the Hillsdale and
San Carlos Caltrain Stations and the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station, would be made available to students and
staff. The project would also extend the exiting turn out to the east of the school to accommodate 14 additional
parking spaces for trail users.
The project site location and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The proposed site plan is shown
on Figure 2.

Scope of Study
This traffic study was conducted for the purpose of identifying potential traffic impacts related to the project. The
potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the Cities of
Redwood City and Belmont and the City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG). The
C/CAG administers the San Mateo County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The traffic study analyzed the traffic impacts of the project on ten key intersections in the vicinity of the project
site. The study intersections were selected in consultation with Redwood City staff and include those intersections
which provide primary access to the project site. The study intersections are listed below and shown on Figure 1.
Four of the ten study intersections are located in Belmont; six of the ten study intersections are located in
Redwood City (Redwood Shores area). One study intersection is part of the CMP roadway network.

Traffic conditions at the study locations were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic. Design
Tech currently starts classes at approximately 8:30 AM and dismisses at 3:30 PM with the before-school program
starting at 8:00 AM and the after-school program ending at 4:15 PM. The peak hour of school traffic in the
morning would coincide with the AM peak hour of commute traffic (generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM). The
peak hour of school traffic in the afternoon would occur before the PM peak hour of commute traffic (typically
between 4:00 and 6:00 PM). However, trips associated with the after-school program would be added to the PM
peak commute hour. These peak commute periods were analyzed because they are the most congested on an
average weekday and the impact on the roadway system by traffic from the school would be greatest during these
periods.
Per CMP technical guidelines, a freeway segment level of service analysis is required when a project would add
trips greater than one percent of a segment’s capacity. Because the proposed project trips represent less than
one percent of capacity to all freeway segments in the project vicinity, a freeway analysis for the CMP is not
necessary. The determination of freeway analysis requirement is included in Appendix A.
The C/CAG requires new development projected to add 100 or more peak-hour trips to the CMP roadway network
to implement transportation demand management (TDM) measures that would reduce project peak-hour trips. In
the vicinity of the project site, facilities that are part of the CMP network include US 101 and El Camino Real (SR
82). The project would add more than 100 peak-hour trips to the CMP facilities in the vicinity of the project site
and is subject to C/CAG requirement.

Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
    Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing conditions were represented by existing traffic volumes on the
                   existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from recent traffic counts and
                   previous traffic studies.

    Scenario 2:    Background Conditions. Background conditions reflect future traffic volumes on the existing
                   roadway network. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing traffic
                   volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet constructed developments in the
                   vicinity of the project. Lists of approved but not yet completed developments were provided by
                   the Cities of Redwood City, Belmont, and San Carlos.

    Scenario 3:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project conditions reflect the projected traffic
                   volumes and proposed roadway network with implementation of the project. Existing plus
                   project traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the trips associated
                   with the project. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                   order to determine potential project impacts.

    Scenario 4:    Background Plus Project Conditions. Background plus project conditions reflect the future traffic
                   volumes and roadway network with implementation of the project. Background plus project
                   traffic volumes were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the trips associated
                   with the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background
                   conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.
    Scenario 5:    Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative conditions reflect the projected traffic volumes on the future
                   roadway network with implementation of the project. The cumulative no project (or cumulative
                   baseline) traffic volumes were estimated by applying a compound growth factor of one percent
                   per year to existing traffic volumes and adding traffic from approved projects in the vicinity. The
                   cumulative scenario assumes a horizon year of 2022, 5 years after the school would be fully
                   occupied in 2017. The estimates of trips generated by the project were then added to the
                   cumulative no project traffic volumes to yield cumulative plus project traffic volumes.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine traffic conditions at study intersections and the traffic
impacts of the project. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the
applicable level of service standards and significant impact criteria.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, previous studies, field observations, and
the Cities of Redwood City, Belmont, and San Carlos. The following data were obtained from these sources:

       Existing intersection peak-hour volumes,
       Lane geometries,
       Signal timing and phasing, and
       Trip generation by approved but not yet completed projects.

Intersection Level of Service Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to
LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays.
This study utilizes TRAFFIX software to determine intersection level of service. The TRAFFIX software is based
on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology for signalized and unsignalized intersections. This
method evaluates intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the


                                                                                                          Page | 5

intersection. This average delay can then be correlated to a level of service. Table 1 presents the level of service
definitions for signalized intersections. The level of service definitions for unsignalized intersections is shown in
Table 2. Note that for unsignalized intersections under two-way or side-street stop control, the level of service is
reported for the worst approach.

             Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the
     A       green phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to            10.0 or less
             the very low vehicle delay.

             Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle
     B       lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average             10.1 to 20.0
             vehicle delay.

             Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
             lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
    C                                                                                                  20.1 to 35.0
             of vehicles stopping is significant, though some vehicles may still pass through
             the intersection without stopping.

             The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
             result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
     D                                                                                                 35.1 to 55.0
             lengths, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
             individual cycle failures are noticeable.

             This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
     E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-          55.1 to 80.0
             to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

             This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
             often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
     F                                                                                             greater than 80.0
             capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also
             be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Level of Service Standards and Significant Impact Criteria
City of Redwood City
The City of Redwood City General Plan contains the following transportation policy with respect to level of service:
          “Program BE-55 / Level of Service Policy Evaluation: Evaluate Redwood City’s current Level of Service
          (LOS) policies for motor vehicle circulation. The evaluation shall consider the following to ensure efficient
          traffic flow and balance multi‐modal mobility goals:
          Maintaining LOS D or better for motor vehicles in all areas of the city, except the Downtown area as
          defined by the Downtown Precise Plan. In Downtown, no minimum vehicular LOS standard will be
          maintained but vehicular LOS will be calculated and alternate LOS standards for other travel modes will
          be established.”
The study intersections are located outside the Downtown area; thus, the intersections are subject to the City’s
LOS D standard.
According to common Redwood City practice, traffic impacts at a study intersection would be considered
significant if the project would cause:
      Signalized Intersection
      1. Operations at a signalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an
         unacceptable level (LOS E or F); or
      2. Average delay at a signalized intersection operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) to increase by
         5 seconds or more.
      Unsignalized Intersection
      1. Operations at an unsignalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an
         unacceptable level (LOS E or F); or
      2. Delay at an unsignalized intersection operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) to increase by 5
         seconds or more; and traffic volumes at the intersection satisfy the Caltrans peak-hour volume signal
         warrant for traffic signal installation.
A significant impact by the City of Redwood City standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that eliminates the project impact.

City of Belmont
The City of Belmont level of service standard for signalized intersections varies according to the existing
intersection level of service. According to the City of Belmont Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies, August 2014,
the project is said to create a potentially significant impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection in the
City of Belmont if for either peak hour the project meets the corresponding criteria shown in Table 3.

                                                                                                And the Volume-to-

Notes:
1. If the addition of project traffic results in a reduction in intersection control delay, then a project impact is
considered potentially significant if 35 or more project vehicle trips are added to an intersection operating at LOS E,
or 20 or more project vehicle trips are added to an intersection operating at LOS F.

CMP Intersection
The intersection of El Camino Real (SR 82) and Ralston Avenue is a CMP intersection. The level of service
standard for CMP intersections is LOS E or better. However, since the City of Belmont has a more conservative
level of service standard that is based on the existing intersection levels of service, this intersection was analyzed
based on the more stringent City of Belmont standards.

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities near the site, including
the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via US 101. US 101 is a north/south freeway that extends from
north of San Francisco to south of San Jose. In the project vicinity, US 101 has eight mixed-flow lanes. US 101
provides site access via the full interchange at Ralston Avenue.
Local access to the school is provided by El Camino Real, Ralston Avenue, Marine Parkway, Oracle Parkway,
and Twin Dolphin Drive. These roadways are described below.
El Camino Real (SR 82) is a six-lane north-south arterial that extends from south of Redwood City north into
South San Francisco. El Camino Real intersects Ralston Avenue in the vicinity of the project site.
Ralston Avenue is an east-west arterial that extends from I-280 in the west to US 101 in the east. Ralston Avenue
is four lanes wide in the project vicinity. Ralston Avenue becomes Marine Parkway east of US 101 and provides
access to the project site via Oracle Parkway.
Marine Parkway is an east-west divided arterial that extends from US 101 in the west and becomes Shearwater
Parkway at Salt Court in the east. Marine Parkway is six-to-eight lanes wide and has a posted speed limit of 35
miles per hour (mph) in the project vicinity. Marine Parkway provides access to the project site via Oracle
Parkway.
Twin Dolphin Drive is a six-lane north-south roadway that extends north from Pico Boulevard to Marine Parkway.
Twin Dolphin Drive provides access to the project site via Marine Parkway.
Oracle Parkway is a three-to-five-lane loop that provides direct access to the site location. Oracle Parkway has a
posted speed limit of 25 mph. Oracle Parkway intersects with Marine Parkway via a four-way intersection
opposite Shoreway Road on the west and a T-intersection on the east.

Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. Bike paths (Class I facilities) are pathways,
separate from roadways that are designated for use by bicycles. Often, these pathways also allow pedestrian
access. Bike lanes (Class II facilities) are lanes on roadways designated for use by bicycles with special lane
markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bike routes (Class III) are existing right-of-ways that accommodate
bicycles but are not separate from the existing travel lanes. Routes are typically designated only with signs. The
existing bicycle facilities in the project vicinity are shown on Figure 3.



                                                                                                            Page | 9
Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                              December 14, 2015

In the Redwood Shores district, the Bay Trail, a Class I multi-use paths run parallel to Oracle Parkway, Marine
Parkway, and Twin Dolphin Drive in the project vicinity and along the north shore of the district. Class II bike lanes
are provided on both sides of Marine Parkway between Shoreway Road and Salt Court and along both sides of
Oracle Parkway. Twin Dolphin Drive is a Class III bike route.
In Belmont, a Class I bike/pedestrian overpass exists over US 101. The overpass begins at the northeast corner
of the intersection at Hiller Street and Ralston Avenue, runs along the northern side of Ralston Avenue and US
101 southbound off-ramp, and connects to Marine Parkway via the Bay Trail in the Redwood Shores district. At
the Hiller Street terminus of the overpass, the bike path is connected to a short segment of shared pedestrian/bike
sidewalk on the west side of Hiller Street extending to Masonic Way. At Masonic Way, there are Class II bike
lanes on both sides of the street extending west to Old County Road. Masonic Way leads directly to the Belmont
Caltrain Station. Masonic Way ends at Old County Road, but the Belmont Station underpass furthers the
bicycle/pedestrian network to El Camino Real. Ralston Avenue is designated as a Class III bike route between El
Camino Real and South Road.
Existing bicycle and pedestrian counts were conducted as part of the peak-hour turning movement counts at the
study intersections on typical weekdays when schools were in session in May 2015. The traffic count data are
included in Appendix B. The bicycle counts show that that bicycle volumes at the study intersections are relatively
low. There were few (less than 10) bicycles in each direction during the analyzed AM and PM peak hours. The
highest volume occurred during the AM peak hour at the Oracle Parkway/Marine Parkway intersection with 23
bicycles on the southbound approach. The intersection is connected to the Bay Trail and US 101 bike/pedestrian
overpass.

Pedestrian Facilities
Roadways providing pedestrian access to the project site include Marine Parkway, Oracle Parkway, and Twin
Dolphin Drive. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of Marine Parkway and Twin Dolphin Drive. The intersection
of Marine Parkway and Oracle Parkway/Shoreway Road has crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads across the
north, south, and east legs. The intersection of Marine Parkway and Twin Dolphin Drive has crosswalks with
pedestrian signal heads across the south and east legs. The intersection of Marine Parkway and Oracle Parkway
has crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads across the north and east legs.
The Bay Trail provides pedestrian access along the outer edge of the Oracle Parkway loop with connections to
Marine Parkway at both ends of the loop. No sidewalk is provided on Oracle Parkway, except near the
intersections. Along Oracle Parkway there are three unsignalized intersections that provide access to the project
site. At the first and third intersections a crosswalk is provided on the west leg. At the second intersection a
crosswalk is provided on the east leg. Each intersection intersects with Oracle internal streets that extend from
the core of the Oracle Campus. Sidewalks are provided along every internal street.
Hexagon conducted pedestrian counts at the study intersections adjacent to the project site. The traffic count data
are included in Appendix B. During both the AM and PM peak hours, pedestrian traffic at the intersection of
Oracle Street #2 and Oracle Parkway was relatively high, with 169 and 94 pedestrians, respectively. This
intersection lies between the Oracle Conference Center and the existing surface parking lot. At all other
intersections adjacent to the project site, pedestrian volumes were relatively low, ranging between 20 and 50
pedestrians during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Transit Services
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans),
Caltrain, and BART. The transit services are described below and shown on Figure 4.

SamTrans Bus Services
       Route 67 provides bus service on school days only on Marine Parkway in the project vicinity with the
        nearest stop at the east Oracle Parkway/Marine Parkway intersection, about 0.4 mile from the project site.
        Route 67 also stops at the Belmont Caltrain Station. As of August 9, 2015, Route 67 will travel westbound
        from Redwood Shores to Ralston Middle School in the AM peak period with three trips that arrive
        between 7:50 AM and 7:57 AM on all weekdays and four trips eastbound from Ralston Middle School to
        Redwood Shores in the afternoon between 3:13 PM and 3:25 PM on all weekdays except Wednesday.
        On Wednesday, because schools end between 12 PM and 1 PM with the half-day programs, Route 67
        departs from the middle school between 12:40 PM and 12:52 PM. Due to its limited directional service,
        this route could be used only by Design Tech students who live within Redwood Shores.

       Route 260 provides bus service on Marine Parkway in the project vicinity with the nearest stop at the east
        Oracle Parkway/Marina Parkway intersection. Route 260 also stops at the Belmont Caltrain Station and
        the San Carlos Caltrain Station. Route 260 provides bus services with 30-minute headways during the
        AM and PM peak periods of school traffic.

       Route 62 provides bus service on Ralston Avenue in the project vicinity with the nearest stop at the Hiller
        Street/ Ralston Avenue intersection, which is about one mile walking distance from the project site. Route
        62 does not stop at the Belmont Caltrain Station, but stops at the Hillsdale Caltrain Station. During both
        the AM and PM peak periods of school traffic, Route 62 stops at the intersection of Hiller Street and
        Ralston Avenue with one-hour headways.

Caltrain Services
Caltrain provides commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy. The project site is located
approximately 1.5 miles from the Belmont Caltrain Station, 3.5 miles from the Hillsdale Caltrain Station and 2.5
miles from the San Carlos Caltrain Station. The Belmont Caltrains station located near the El Camino
Real/Ralston Avenue intersection provides access to the project site via a bike path (described above). The
Belmont Caltrain Station provides commuter rail services during weekdays with a one-hour headway during the
morning school peak period, and 30-minute headways during the afternoon school peak period. The Hillsdale and
San Carlos Stations provide commuter rail services during weekdays with 30-minute headways in the morning
and afternoon school peak periods.
Caltrain/SamTrans provides shuttle service from the Hillsdale and San Carlos Stations to the project vicinity,
including Oracle Shuttle, Redwood Shores Twin Dolphin Area Shuttle (Bridge Park), and Redwood Shores Shuttle
(Clipper). These shuttle routes are described below and shown on Figure 4.

       The Oracle Shuttle runs between the San Carlos and Hillsdale Caltrain Stations and Oracle Parkway. The
        nearest stop to the project site is at 500 Oracle Parkway approximately 1,300 feet from the site. It
        provides four shuttles from the San Carlos and Hillsdale Caltrain Stations to Oracle Parkway between 7
        AM and 10 AM and five shuttles from Oracle Parkway to the San Carlos and Hillsdale Caltrain Stations
        between 3 PM and 7 PM.

       The Redwood Shores Twin Dolphin Area Shuttle (Bridge Park) runs between the San Carlos Caltrain
        Station and Oracle Parkway. The nearest stop to the project site is at 300 Oracle Parkway approximately
        600 feet from the site. It provides four shuttles from the San Carlos Caltrain Station to Oracle Parkway
        between 7:00 AM and 9:30 AM and six shuttles from Oracle Parkway to the San Carlos Caltrain Station
        between 2 PM and 7 PM.

       The Redwood Shores Shuttle (Clipper) runs between the San Carlos Caltrain Station and Oracle
        Parkway. The nearest stop to the project site is at 600 Clipper approximately 2,000 feet from the site. It




                                                                                                      Page | 12

        provides four shuttles from the San Carlos Caltrain Station to 600 Clipper between 7 AM and 10 AM and
        four shuttles from shuttles to the San Carlos Caltrain Station between 2 PM and 7 PM.
Additionally. Caltrain provides the free Belmont Hillsdale Shuttle between the Belmont Station and the Hillsdale
Station for access to baby bullet rail service at the Hillsdale Station.

BART Services
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) provides commuter rail service between Millbrae, San Francisco, and the East
Bay. It connects to Caltrain at the Millbrae Station. The project site is located approximately 9.5 miles south of the
Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station. Caltrain/SamTrans provides shuttle service from the Millbrae Caltrain/BART
Station to the major employee centers in the vicinity of the station; however, no shuttle services are provided
between the station and the Oracle campus. However, Oracle offers employee shuttle programs to the Millbrae
Caltrain/BART Station.

Oracle Shuttle Programs
In addition to the Caltrain shuttle services provided at the Caltrain Stations, Oracle offers employee shuttle
programs to the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station, and the Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations. The shuttle
service will be available to Design Tech students and staff.

Intersection Lane Configurations and Traffic Volumes
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained from field observations and are shown
on Figure 5.
Existing weekday AM (7:00-9:00 AM) and PM (4:00-6:00 PM) peak hour traffic volumes were obtained from
manual turning-movement counts. New traffic counts were conducted at all study intersections on typical
weekdays on May 28, 2015 and June 9, 2015 when schools were in session. Because traffic counts are generally
not conducted during the summer, the summer 2015 traffic counts were compared to the available count data
from fall of 2013 at four study intersections to determine if the new counts were affected by the summer season.
The fall 2013 traffic volumes were found to be greater than the summer 2015 traffic volumes at most study
intersections. Therefore, with one exception, the 2013 traffic volumes were used for the study. At the US 101
Southbound Ramps/Ralston Avenue intersection, the 2015 PM peak-hour volume is greater than the 2013
volume. Thus, the higher 2015 volume was used.
At remaining six study intersections where recent counts are not available for comparison, traffic volumes from
summer 2015 were increased with a seasonal adjustment factor of 3%. The 3% factor was derived from a
comparison of fall 2013 traffic volumes to summer 2015 traffic volumes. The existing peak hour traffic volumes
used for the study are shown graphically on Figure 6. New 2015 traffic count data are included in Appendix B.

Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 4. The results show
that all signalized intersections are operating at LOS D or better. The level of service calculation sheets are
included in Appendix C.

Observed Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated intersection levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing
traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the level
of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing traffic conditions.
Overall, no significant intersection operational deficiencies were observed during the AM or PM peak hours of
traffic, and the level of service analysis appears to reflect actual existing traffic conditions at the study
intersections. Hexagon observed minor operational issues at the following intersections:

       El Camino Real and Ralston Avenue. During AM peak hour, the eastbound traffic frequently queued past
        Sixth Avenue and required more than two cycles to clear. The southbound left-turn pocket occasionally
        overflowed, but traffic was able to clear within one cycle. During PM peak hour, the westbound traffic
        frequently queued past Old County Road and required more than two cycles to clear.
       Old County Road and Ralston Avenue. Vehicle queues in the northbound and southbound left-turn lanes
        on Old County Road occasionally required two cycles to clear during the PM peak hour.
       Oracle Street #1 and Oracle Parkway (all-way stop controlled). Vehicle queues in the eastbound through
        lane on Marine Parkway were lengthy during the AM peak hour.




                                                                                                         Page | 15

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions without the project. Traffic volumes for background conditions
comprise volumes from existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in the
vicinity of the site. This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes and the
resulting traffic conditions. The background scenario predicts a realistic baseline traffic condition that would occur
as approved development gets built and occupied.

Roadway Network
The roadway network under background conditions would be the same as the existing roadway network because
there are no planned and funded transportation improvements at the study intersections that would alter the
existing intersection lane configurations.
The City of Belmont is undergoing the Ralston Avenue Corridor Study and Transportation Improvements Plan to
improve multi-modal use along the corridor. The proposed improvements would not alter the existing intersection
lane configurations at study intersections on Ralston Avenue.

Approved Developments
Background traffic volumes were forecast by estimating trip generation for a list of approved but not yet completed
projects. Based on the review of development projects in the Cities of Redwood City, Belmont, and San Carlos,
the following approved but not-constructed projects were considered under background conditions because they
would contribute background trips to the study intersections.

       700 Island Parkway, Belmont (Autobahn Motors Expansion) – Reconstruct and expand the existing
        dealership building from the existing 51,000 s.f. to 57,000 s.f.
       576-600 El Camino Real, Belmont – Demolition of three existing commercial and residential buildings and
        construct 32 residential units and 11,700 s.f. of retail space.
       400-490 El Camino Real, Belmont – Demolish 14,000 s.f. of office space and a 2,400-s.f. convenience
        store and construct 73 residential units and 5,000 s.f. of retail space.
       6-8 and 10 Davis Drive, Belmont (Crystal Springs Uplands School) – Demolish two vacant buildings
        previously used as office and warehouse space and build a middle school campus with 240 students and
        43 faculty/staff members.
       BRSSD 5 School Expansions, Belmont – Expand five schools in the Belmont-Redwood Shores School
        District (BRSSD) by a total of 36 new classrooms (788 students) among the five schools.

        Transit Village, San Carlos – Redevelop the project site that would house 202 apartment units and 25,800
         s.f. of commercial space1.
There are no approved projects in Redwood City that would impact the study intersections.

Intersection Traffic Volumes
Background peak-hour traffic volumes were calculated by adding to existing volumes the estimated traffic from
the approved developments. Vehicle trips from the each of the projects were obtained from the project’s traffic
impact study (TIA) or environmental impact report (EIR). The estimated trips were assigned to the study
intersections according to distributions identified in the development TIAs and EIRs. The trips assigned to the
study intersections are tabulated in Appendix D. Background traffic volumes are shown on Figure 7.

Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized in Table 5. The results
show that all study intersections would operate at LOS D or better. The level of service calculation sheets are
included in Appendix C.

 The Samtrans TIA analyzed 280 apartment units, 14,326 s.f. of retail space, and 23,797 s.f. of office space. The project was
updated to 202 apartment units and 25,800 s.f. of commercial space as of October 2014. The trip generation in the Samtrans
TIA was used in this analysis.

Project Conditions
This chapter describes the roadway traffic operations under existing plus project conditions and background plus
project conditions, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts caused by the project.
Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were to be occupied prior to the other
approved projects in the area. However, it is unlikely that this traffic condition would occur, since some of the
other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely be built and occupied during the time
the project is going through the development review process.

Roadway Network
The roadway network under project conditions would be the same as the existing roadway network because there
are no planned and funded transportation improvements at the study intersections that would alter the existing
intersection lane configurations.
However, implementation of the project would require removing the existing parking lot in the eastern portion of
the project site and adding a new parking lot in the western portion of the project site (see Figure 2). As a result,
the existing driveways that intersect with the Oracle Street #2/Oracle Parkway and Oracle Street #3/Oracle
Parkway intersection would be removed and a new exit-only driveway would be added to the Oracle Street
#1/Oracle Parkway intersection. There would be no changes in intersection controls at these three intersections.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would appear are
estimated using a three-step process: 1) trip generation, 2) trip distribution, and 3) trip assignment. In determining
project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the project site is estimated for the AM and
PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of the directions to and from which the
project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project trips are assigned to specific streets and
intersections. These procedures are described below.

Trip Generation
Trip generation for the proposed Oracle Educational Facility was estimated based on the existing student
residences (zip code data), travel patterns and mode choices observed at the existing Design Tech High School
and the proposed numbers of students and staff/teachers at the project site. Peak-hour vehicle trips are
anticipated to be generated by vehicles dropping off and picking up students, students with internships that drive
to school, and staff and teachers.
Design Tech has a no driving/parking policy for students; therefore, although the school attracts students from the
entire Bay Area, including San Francisco to the north, Half Moon Bay/Montara to the west, Hayward/San Lorenzo


                                                                                                        Page | 23
Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                               December 14, 2015


to the east, and Santa Clara to the south, about 60% of existing students take Caltrain and BART to school. The
school currently leases space at the San Mateo county Office of Education Regional Occupation Program, which
is about 2,500 feet (0.5 miles) east of the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station. The project site on the Oracle campus
is located near the Belmont Caltrain Station (1.5 miles). Shuttle services are available between the Oracle
campus and the Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations and the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station and would be
made available to its students and staff. Additionally, Design Tech would continue to implement the no
driving/parking policy at the project site. Therefore, it is expected that a similar percentage of students would take
Caltrain and BART after the school moves to the project site.
The percentage of students that would come to the school by transit, vehicles (driven by parents), and bicycles
were estimated based on the residence locations of existing students. Design tech provided resident zip codes for
all students enrolled for the 2015/16 school year. Based on the zip code data, 25% of students live in adjacent
cities (Belmont, San Carlos, Foster City, Redwood Shores) or do not live near Caltrain and BART stations (Half
Moon Bay, Montara). For those 25% of students, 21% were assumed to be driven to school in cars and dropped-
off, 1% would take local SamTrans buses or shuttles, and 3% would bike to school. For the remaining 75% of
students who live along the Caltrain or BART service corridors, 15% were assumed to be driven by parents and
60% would take trains. The mode choice assumptions for students are summarized below:

       Drop-off by cars: 21% + 15% = 36%;
       Transit: 60% + 1% = 61%;
       Bicycle: 3%.
Vehicle trips associated with students that would be driven to school were estimated assuming a vehicle
occupancy rate of 1.5 students per vehicle. Consistent with data provided from the existing Design Tech, it was
assumed that about 30% of students would participate in after school programs that end at 4:15 PM. Only those
students would generate trips during PM peak hour (4 – 5 PM).
In addition to the drop-off trips, students that participate in internships would also generate vehicle trips. The
school estimated that about 20 students would participate in internships. Depending on the internship locations
and schedule, some of the students may not be able to take transit and would need to drive to school. The traffic
analysis presented in this report assumes that all 20 students would drive to school with trips occurring during AM
and PM peak hours. This is a conservative worst-case scenario since many student interns would take transit
and/or work to and from their work sites.
About 50% of staff/teachers currently drive to school. The driving percentage for staff is higher than for students
because staff/teachers may live closer to school and on-site parking would be provided. The percentage was
assumed to be same at the project site. All teachers and staff were assumed to arrive and depart within the AM
and PM peak commute periods.
Table 6 summarizes the trip generation estimates for the project. In the AM peak hour, the project is expected to
generate a total of 289 new trips, with 162 inbound trips and 127 outbound trips. In the PM peak hour, the project
is expected to generate a total of 111 new trips, with 38 inbound trips and 73 outbound trips.
Although Design Tech already has a relatively high percentage of students taking transit, it will implement TDM
measures to encourage more students and employees to carpool, take transit, or use active modes of transport to
get to and from school. The TDM measures proposed by Design Tech are summarized in Chapter 6 and included
in Appendix E. To be conservative, this report assumes the existing mode split will continue with no additional trip
reductions from the TDM measures.

Notes:
1. The school estimated that about 20 students would participate in internships. For the study, it was assumed that all 20
students would drive to school with trips occurring during peak hours.
2. Percentages of mode choices for students were estimated based on the residence zip codes of existing students.
25% of students live in adjacent cities (Belmont, San Carlos, Foster City, Redwood Shores) or do not live near Caltain and BART
stations (Half Moon Bay, Montara), of which 21% were assumed to be dropped-off by cars, 1% would take local SamTrans buses
or shuttles, and 3% would bike to school. 75% of students could take Caltain and BART, of which 15% were assumed to be
driven by parents and 60% would take trains.
Drop-off by cars: 21% + 15% = 36%; Transit: 60% + 1% = 61%; Bicycle: 3%
3. Vehicle occupancy of 1.5 students/vehicle was assumed for peak-hour trips.
4. It was assumed that about 30% of students would participate in after school programs with trips occurring during PM peak
hour (4 PM - 5 PM) .
5. It was assumed that all teachers and staff would arrive and depart within the peak commute periods.
6. More teachers/staff (50%) were assumed to drive to school since they may live closer and parking would be provided on site.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the project was estimated based on the residence zip code data of existing
students and the arterials that provide access between project site and the students’ residences. The trip
distribution pattern for the project is shown on Figure 8.
The peak-hour trips generated by the project were assigned to the roadway network in accordance with the
project trip distribution pattern. The parking lot would be served by two one-way driveways. Traffic would enter at
the east driveway (inbound) and exit through the west driveway (outbound), which would be located directly
opposite Oracle Street #1. Vehicles entering the parking lot and drop-off loop would be restricted to right turns
only. At the outbound driveway, vehicles would be permitted to turn left onto eastbound Oracle Parkway or right
onto westbound Oracle Parkway. Figure 9 shows the assignment of project trips at each study intersection.
Additionally, the project would remove the existing parking lot for the Conference Center event on the project site.
The parking lot is across the street from the Oracle Conference Center and is signed for conference center even
parking only. Therefore, it is expected that the peak-hour vehicle trips to and from this parking lot are by
conference attendees or Oracle visitors. Without the parking lot, these vehicles are expected to park in the


                                                                                                                    Page | 25

parking garages on Oracle Streets #2 and #3. Therefore, the driveway trips were reassigned to Oracle Streets #2
and #3. Figure 9 reflects the reassignment of existing driveway trips.

Intersection Traffic Volumes
Project impacts were evaluated relative to both (1) existing traffic volumes and (2) background traffic volumes. For
the existing plus project scenario, the new trips generated by the project were added to the existing traffic
volumes (described in Chapter 2) to derive the existing plus project traffic volumes. Figure 10 shows the
intersection turning-movement volumes under existing plus project conditions. For the background plus project
scenario, the new trips generated by the project were added to the background traffic volumes (described in
Chapter 3) to derive the background plus project traffic volumes. Figure 11 shows the intersection turning-
movement volumes under background plus project conditions. Peak-hour intersection volumes for the study
intersections are tabulated in Appendix D.

Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis for (1) existing plus project and (2) background plus project
conditions are summarized in Tables 7 and 8. It should be noted that, at some study intersections, the average
delay under project conditions is shown to be better than under no-project conditions. This occurs because the
intersection delay is a weighted average of all intersection movements. When project traffic is added to
movements with delays lower than the average intersection delay, the average delay for the entire intersection
can decrease. The results of the level of service calculations show that under both existing plus project and
background plus project conditions, all study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of
service (LOS D or better). For intersections in Belmont, the increase in average delay and V/C would not exceed
the significant impact thresholds listed in Table 3. Therefore, the project’s impact on intersection levels of service
would be less than significant.

Cumulative Conditions
This chapter describes the roadway traffic operations under cumulative conditions and cumulative plus project
conditions. For this study, cumulative conditions reflect a horizon year of 2022, which is 5 years after the school
would be fully occupied in 2017. Cumulative traffic volumes reflect regional traffic growth in the study area and
traffic generated by the approved development projects. Included in this chapter are the procedures used to
determine cumulative traffic volumes and a description of the resulting traffic conditions and any impacts caused
by the project.

Roadway Network
The roadway network under cumulative conditions would be the same as the existing roadway network because
there are no planned and funded transportation improvements at the study intersections that would alter the
existing intersection lane configurations.
The roadway network under cumulative plus project conditions would be the same as project conditions described
in Chapter 4.

Intersection Traffic Volumes
The cumulative scenarios assume a horizon year of 2022. Cumulative traffic volumes were estimated by first
applying a 1% growth factor per year until 2022 to the existing (2015) traffic volumes. With compounding, this
yields a factor of 1.072. The growth rate and horizon year were determined by the City of Redwood City. The trips
generated by approved projects in the vicinity were then added to obtain cumulative no project traffic volumes.
The cumulative no project traffic volumes are shown on Figure 12.
The project trips were then added to the cumulative traffic volumes to yield cumulative plus project traffic volumes.
The intersection turning-movement volumes under cumulative plus project conditions are depicted on Figure 13.

Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the level of service analysis under cumulative conditions and cumulative plus project conditions are
summarized in Table 9. The results show that under cumulative conditions and cumulative plus project conditions,
all study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better). For intersections in
Belmont, the increase in average delay and V/C would not exceed the significant impact thresholds listed in Table
3.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project, including:

       Site access and on-site circulation
       Potential impacts to pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities
       Parking Demand and Supply
       TDM Measures
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City council, the analyses in this chapter
are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by the traffic
engineering community.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
Site access and on-site circulation were evaluated using commonly accepted transportation planning principles.
This review is based on the project site plan prepared by DES Architects + Engineers on October 30, 2015 (see
Figure 2). The site access and circulation were evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site’s driveways with
regard to traffic volumes, delays, vehicle queues, geometric design, sight distance, and truck access. In general,
the site plan shows adequate site access and internal circulation.
The project would provide a parking lot for staff/visitor parking and student drop-off. The drop-off loop would run
along the back side of the parking lot and would be served by the same driveways. The parking lot and drop-off
loop would be served by served by two one-way driveways on Oracle Parkway. Traffic would enter at the east
driveway (inbound) and exit through the west driveway (outbound), which would be located directly opposite
Oracle Street #1.The inbound driveway would be located approximately 145 feet east of this intersection. The
driveways would be 22 feet wide, which meets the minimum driveway width set forth in the City’s zoning code.
The one-way drive aisle is 13 feet wide, which is adequate for one-way circulation of vehicular traffic and complies
with the minimum width requirement for emergency vehicle access. The parking lot would also include a trash
enclosure near the east driveway next to the project building. The 22-foot driveways and drop-off loop would
provide an unobstructed approach for collection trucks.
Vehicles entering the parking lot and drop-off loop would be restricted to right turns only to avoid delays
associated with uncontrolled inbound left-turn movements. At the outbound driveway, vehicles would be permitted
to turn left onto eastbound Oracle Parkway or right onto westbound Oracle Parkway. The outbound driveway
intersection would operate under all-way stop control. Project traffic entering and exiting the site would not
significantly affect intersection operations or cause back-ups on Oracle Parkway. However, the following measure
is recommended to facilitate traffic operations during drop-off and pick-up.




                                                                                                      Page | 37
Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                                December 14, 2015

    Recommendation 1 – Designate staff to control the drop-off/pick-up traffic. Staff should guide entering
                       vehicles at the inbound driveway to prevent blockage of through traffic on Oracle
                       Parkway and prevent drop-off and pick-up.
Field observations indicated that the vehicle queue for the eastbound through movement at the Oracle Street
#1/Oracle Parkway intersection was lengthy during the AM peak hour. The drop-off traffic would not add
eastbound traffic to the intersection because it can only make westbound right-turns into the parking lot by
traveling to the east Oracle Parkway/Marine Parkway intersection and approaching the school via westbound
Oracle Parkway. Although the project would add southbound traffic to the intersection, it would not affect the
intersection operation or cause traffic delay on Oracle Parkway. Field observations indicated no operation issues
at the three study intersections on Oracle Parkway in the PM peak hour; therefore, vehicles accessing the project
site would experience minimal delays.

Sight Distance at Project Driveways
In general, the project driveways should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight distance, thereby
ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles traveling on Oracle
Parkway. Any landscaping, parking, and signage should be located in such a way to ensure an unobstructed view
for drivers entering and exiting the site.
Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway, and provides drivers
with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic. Sight distance generally should be provided in
accordance with Caltrans design standards. The minimum acceptable sight distance is often considered the
Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed
limit on Oracle Parkway is 25 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance is 200 feet. This means
that a driver must be able to see 200 feet down Oracle Parkway to locate a sufficient gap to turn out of the
driveways. There are no roadway curves or landscaping features shown on the site plan that would obstruct the
vision of exiting drivers. On-street parking would be prohibited on Oracle Parkway along the project frontage.
Therefore, adequate sight distance would be provided at the project driveways.

Access and Circulation for Emergency Vehicles and Trucks
Emergency response vehicles would access the project site from Oracle Parkway. A delivery shuttle/truck drop-off
area 40 feet in length would be provided on Oracle Parkway in front of the project building. Collection trucks
would assess the trash enclosure located in the parking lot via the parking lot driveways. The parking lot
driveways are 22 feet wide with 13-foot one-way drive aisles and 22-foot drop-off loop, which would provide
unobstructed access and circulation for collection trucks. Site access and circulation for collection trucks were
evaluated with vehicle turning movement templates. SU-30 trucks, representing medium-size trucks would be
able to access, circulate, and exit the parking lot.

Drop-Off and Pick-Up
The project would include a student drop-off loop along the back side of the parking lot with the capacity of 24
vehicles (about 550 feet in length). Vehicles would enter from the east driveway (inbound) and exit through the
west driveway (outbound). School drop-off and pick-up operations and resulting vehicle queues are estimated
based on the queuing estimates for the Rocketship Redwood Academy TIA (March 2015). The Rocketship TIA
estimated that 575 feet of queuing space would be needed for 282 AM peak-hour inbound trips generated by
parents. Design Tech would generate 127 AM inbound trips associated with students that would be driven to
school (Table 6). Thus, it is estimated that 259 feet of queuing space would be needed for drop-off operations in
the morning at Design Tech. In the afternoon, it was assumed that about 30% of students would stay for after
school programs; therefore, it is estimated that 181 feet of queuing space would be needed for pick-up
operations. The estimated queuing length is shorter than the provided queuing length, so the drop-off/pick-up
vehicles are not expected to queue onto Oracle Parkway.
Although Design Tech staff would monitor drop-off and pick-up operations, Recommendation 1 described above
should be implemented to ensure that vehicles do not turn left into the inbound driveway, minimize any vehicle
queues that may develop during drop-off/pick-up periods, and manage conflicts between vehicles and
pedestrians.



                                                                                                         Page | 38

Additionally, the proposed TDM strategies included in Appendix E are expected to encourage more students to
take transit and carpool and reduce the vehicle trips generated by the students thereby reducing the length of
queue storage needed for drop-off and pick-up operations.

Potential Impacts on Pedestrians, Bicycles, and Transit
Figure 12 shows the pedestrian access routes adjacent to the project site. Sidewalks would be provided along the
project street frontage that connect to the crosswalks at adjacent intersections. A sidewalk also would be provided
adjacent to the student drop-off loop that connects to the Bay Trail and the project building. Design Tech would
have joint use of the fitness center and conference center in the Oracle Campus. Student access for these
facilities would be provided via the sidewalks along the project frontage and the crosswalks at the Oracle Street
#1/Oracle Parkway and Oracle Street #2/Oracle Parkway intersections. Both intersections are all-way stop-
controlled. At the Oracle Street #1/Oracle Parkway intersection, a crosswalk exists on the east leg, but there is no
crosswalk on the south leg for students accessing the fitness center. The following measure is recommended to
enhance the safety of students walking to and from the fitness center.
    Recommendation 2 – Provide a crosswalk on the south leg of the Oracle Street #1/Oracle Parkway
                       intersection.
Although few students are expected to access the school via this crosswalk at the Oracle Street #1/Oracle
Parkway during drop-off and pick-up, implementation of Recommendation 1 would ensure that vehicles obey safe
loading practices.
As show on Figure 12, new crosswalks would be provided at the parking lot driveways. However, the crosswalk at
the inbound driveway would be set back from the street, which would make it more difficult for vehicles entering
the driveway to see pedestrians in the crosswalk. The following measure is recommended to improve the
pedestrian safety during crossing.
    Recommendation 3 – Move the crosswalk at the inbound driveway closer to the travel lanes on Oracle
                       Parkway.
As shown on Figure 3, bicycle facilities within typical biking distance of the project site are well provided by the
Bay Trail, bike lanes on Oracle Parkway and Marine Parkway, and a bike connection between the project site and
the Belmont Caltrain Station. The project would also improve the section of Bay Trail behind project site.
However, because the bike connection between the project site and the Belmont Caltrain Station via City streets
and the Bay Trail is circuitous, the following measure is recommended to direct students and staff to the school.
    Recommendation 4 – Work with the City to identify appropriate locations for wayfinding signage along City
                       streets and/or the Bay Trail between the project site and the Belmont Caltrain Station.
Transit in the project vicinity is provided by SamTrans buses, Caltrain/SamTrans shuttles, and Oracle shuttle
programs. SamTrans buses run on Marine Parkway with the nearest bus stops located at the east Oracle
Parkway/Marine Parkway intersection, about 0.4 miles to the project site. A continuous pedestrian path is
available via crosswalks, sidewalks, and the Bay Trail between the school and the nearest bus stops. Caltrain
shuttles that run between the Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations and the Oracle campus include the
Oracle Shuttle, Bridge Park Shuttle, and Clipper Shuttle, with the nearest stops at 500 Oracle Parkway (1,300 feet
from the site) , 300 Oracle Parkway (600 feet from the site), and 600 Clipper (2,000 feet from the site),
respectively. In addition, Oracle offers employee shuttle programs to the Millbrae Caltrain/BART Station, and the
Hillsdale and San Carlos Caltrain Stations. These shuttles would be made available to students and staff of the
school with a dedicated drop-off area provided in the parking lot. The school also proposes to purchase a van to
transport students and staff to and from the Belmont Caltrain Station around midday so that they can participate in
concurrent college enrollment and internships.
In summary, the project is well served by the existing pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities. The project would
not result in changes to the existing pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities. The project would increase vehicle
traffic across the existing bike lanes at project driveways on Oracle Parkway and at the Oracle Parkway/Marine
Parkway intersection and would increase usage of the existing bike and pedestrian facilities. However, the
existing facilities are adequate to meet the increased demand without any improvements. Therefore, there would
be no impacts to these facilities.

Oracle Educational Facility–Traffic Impact Analysis                                                December 14, 2015


Parking Demand and Supply
Based on the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance (Section 30.5), the required parking for schools enrolling students
in the 10th grade or below is one space for each classroom and administrative office plus one space for each 100
square feet (s.f.) in the auditorium. The required parking for schools enrolling students in the 11th grade and
above shall provide one space for each student over 16 years in age. The school consists of 8 classrooms for 9th
and 10th grade, 275 students in 11th and 12th grade, 15 offices, and 2,200 s.f. of auditorium space. Therefore,
the requirement would be 320 on-site parking spaces with 275 spaces for 11th and 12th grade students and 45
spaces for other uses. Based on the site plan shown in Figure 2, the school proposes to provide 59 on-site
parking spaces, including 35 spaces in the parking lot and 24 spaces in the student drop-off area.
Because the school has a no driving/parking policy for students in all grades, the parking lot would only be used
by staff, visitors and a small number of students who participate in internships on a schedule where transit is not
an option. Based on the mode share of the existing staff, it is expected that about 50% of staff/teachers (about 15
staff) would drive to school. Approximately 20 students in grades 11 and 12 may participate in internships. While
most student interns are expected to take transit and/or walk to and from their work site, some student interns
may be permitted to drive if their schedule or work location makes transit infeasible. Therefore, total parking
demand for the 15 staff and some student interns who drive is not expected to exceed the parking supply of 35
spaces. Additionally, the school’s TDM strategies included in Appendix E are expected to encourage more school
staff and students to take transit and carpool and further reduce the parking demand. Therefore, the parking lot is
expected to meet the future parking demand.
The site plan shows a bike corral located at the southwest corner of the building. The corral would provide parking
for up to 28 bicycles. The Zoning Ordinance (Section 30.6) requires one bicycle parking space per 5,000 s.f. of
floor area. The gross building area for the project is 64,000 s.f., which would require 13 bicycle parking spaces.
Therefore, the proposed bike corral with 28 spaces fulfills the zoning code requirements of 13 spaces. It is
anticipated that about 3% of students would ride bicycles to school (discussed in Trip Generation above), which
would be 17 students. The provided bicycle parking spaces would be sufficient to accommodate these students.
The project would remove the existing parking lot at the project site. There are a total of 74 spaces in the parking
lot plus 14 stalls on Oracle Parkway for the trail users. According to the City staff, the existing parking lot provides
excess parking spaces above that required for the Conference Center. The parking requirement is already
satisfied within the exiting parking structures. Therefore, the removal the excess spaces is not expected to cause
an overall parking shortage within the Oracle campus. The project would replace the existing Bay Trail spaces on
Oracle Parkway by extending the existing turn out east of the school to accommodate 14 additional parking
spaces.

TDM Measures
Design Tech will implement TDM measures for the project to encourage more students and employees to
carpool, take transit, or use active modes of transport to get to and from school. Table 10 lists the TDM measures
proposed by Design Tech and the estimated C/CAG trip credits (see Appendix E for a full description of the
proposed Design Tech TDM program). The TDM measures are expected to reduce vehicle trips, vehicle queuing
during drop-off and pick-up, and parking demand. As shown in Table 6, the project is expected to generate 289
AM peak-hour trips and with the proposed TDM measures, 151 peak-hour trip credits are estimated per C/CAG
guidelines. According to C/CAG guidelines, the project is required to reduce the demand for all new peak-hour
trips generated by the school. However, many of the TDM measures listed in the C/CAG guidelines are not
applicable to the school and the school already has a relatively high percentage of students taking transit (60%).
Thus, it is infeasible to mitigate every peak-hour trip generated by the project. It should be noted that while the
trips generated by the school would be new to the roadways immediately adjacent to the project site, in a regional
context, the Design Tech school trips are merely reassigned trips from other schools in the area where the
students would have otherwise attended.

Notes:
1. The school already has 60% of students taking transit under the current no driving/parking policy and TDM
   measures (discounted transit pass and flexible scheduling). It is assumed the shuttle services would encourage
   additional 5% of students to take transit.
2. It is assumed the program would encourage additional 5% of students/parents to carpool, which has been
   informally implemented by the school.
3. The TDM measures have been implemented under current conditions and accounted for the trip generation
   estimates. Therefore, no additional trips are credited.
