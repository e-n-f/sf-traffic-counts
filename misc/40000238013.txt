Findings of Fact:
General:
1. The applicant proposes construction of a new 120-bed psychiatric hospital, approximately
   89,000 square feet to include 38 new parking spaces and approximately 1,100 cubic yards
   of grade and fill activity on a site zoned “HMX” Hospital Medical Mixed Use district. An
   existing 66,616 square-foot medical office building would be demolished.
   An environmental review is required for the proposal in accordance with the SEPA, RCW
   43.21C, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 197-11, and Tacoma Municipal Code
   (TMC) 13.12 Environmental Code. The 12,000 square foot threshold for construction or
   demolition of a commercial building is being exceeded, as is the 500 cubic yard threshold for
   grade and fill activity.
Earth:
2. The project proposes to comply with all regulations including the International Building Code
   (IBC) Appendix J (Grading) as adopted and amended by the City of Tacoma, as well as
   TMC Chapter 13.06 Zoning and Chapter 13.11 Critical Areas Ordinance.
Air:
3. Watering of exposed soil during construction to suppress dust will ensure that no impacts to
   ambient air quality will result from the project.
Water:
4. The project will meet all requirements of the current and any future revisions to the
   Stormwater Management Manual, the Critical Areas Ordinance and other City regulatory
   requirements related to stormwater.
5. Potential significant adverse impacts to groundwater quality resulting from the installation
   and use of the underground storage tanks will be addressed through compliance with WAC
   173-360 and WAC 173-491 Underground Storage Tank Regulations and TMC 3.02 Fire
   Code.
6. The site is not located within a flood hazard and/or coastal high hazard area as regulated by
   TMC 13.11.600, 13.11.610 and 13.11.620 and Sections 2.12.040 and 2.12.050.
Plants:
7. The proposed project will meet TMC 13.06.502 Landscaping/Buffering Standards.
Aesthetics:
8. The proposed project will meet TMC 13.06.501 Building Design Standards, TMC 13.06.502
   Landscaping/Buffering Standards, and TMC 13.06.503 Residential Compatibility Standards
   through either compliance with the standards outright or through complying with conditions
   as set forth in a variance (as necessary).
Animals:
9. No state or federal candidate, threatened or endangered plant or animal species, or habitat
   has been identified on the project site.
Energy and Natural Resources:
10. The proposed project will comply with the City’s Energy Code.

Environmental Health:
11. According to the Department of Ecology (Ecology) Facility/Site Atlas, the site is located
    within the Tacoma Smelter Plume with an arsenic concentration range of “Non-Detect to
    20.0 ppm”. Due to the facility atlas indicating that arsenic concentration is below the Model
    Toxics Control Act standards, no further review of the site relative to Asarco contamination is
    required at this time.
12. All requirements of the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department (TPCHD) and Ecology
    will be met.
Noise:
13. All WAC noise levels shall be met.
14. Activities at the site shall comply with all applicable provisions of TMC 8.122 Noise
    Enforcement.
Land Use:
15. The project is a permitted use within the “HMX” Hospital Medical Mixed-Use District but the
    current plan is not clearly in conformance with TMC Section(s) 13.06.300 Development
    Standards, TMC 13.06.501 Building Design Standards, TMC 13.06.502
    Landscaping/Buffering Standards, and TMC 13.06.503 Residential Compatibility Standards.
16. The project will be revised to meet these standards or the applicant will obtain the
    appropriate relief from strict application of the zoning code standards through a variance as
    set forth in TMC 13.06.645. Compliance with the development standards of the TMC or with
    the conditions placed upon a discretionary land use permit (variance) will ensure that the
    project has either avoided or mitigated any and all adverse impacts related to aesthetics,
    design, landscaping, and setbacks.
17. Any project changes resulting from a discretionary land use permit or from further
    refinements in the plan which would significantly change the scope or the impacts of the
    project would result in further environmental review.
Housing:
18. The project will provide no units of housing. No adverse impacts to housing will result from
    the proposal.
Recreation:
19. The project will not be developed on property designated as open space or public recreation
    area. No adverse impacts to recreation will result from the proposal.
Historical and cultural preservation:
20. The project is not located within or adjacent to any property listed on the Tacoma,
    Washington State or National Registers of Historic Places, and is not within proximity to any
    known archaeological site or archaeological site that is inventoried by the State of
    Washington Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. Additional review of
    impacts to cultural resources may be required for projects under the jurisdiction of federal
    agencies under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800).
Transportation:
21. The project will comply with TMC 13.06.510 Off-street parking and storage areas.

22. A traffic impact analysis for the project was prepared by Transportation Engineering
    Northwest, dated January 13, 2015 (signed February 1, 2015), and has been submitted to,
    reviewed, and approved by the Public Works Engineering Division. (Attachment “B”.) The
    Engineering Division indicates that the traffic volumes generated by the proposal will not
    result in significant adverse impacts to the City’s street system. See Attachment “A” for
    comments from Jennifer Kammerzell.
Public Services/Public Utilities:
23. Project concurrency certification or an appropriate mitigation will be completed at the
    building permit review stage.
24. The project will comply with emergency vehicle circulation requirements.
25. Fire protection must be provided in accordance with the requirements of TMC 3.02 Fire
    Code.
26. The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department (TPCHD) will require a Solid Waste
    Handling Permit for the project. Potential significant adverse impacts to environmental
    health will be adequately mitigated through compliance with the provisions of the permit.

CONCLUSION OF THE RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL:
The City of Tacoma, the lead agency for this proposal, has determined that the requirements for
environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures have been adequately addressed
in the development regulations and comprehensive plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW,
and in other applicable local, state, or federal laws or rules, as provided by RCW 43.21C.240
and WAC 197-11-158. The City will not require any additional mitigation measures under
SEPA.
Additionally, the City of Tacoma has determined that this project does not have a probable
significant adverse impact on the environment. The proposal will have no significant adverse
environmental impacts to fish and wildlife, water, noise, transportation, air quality, environmental
health, public services and utilities, or land and shoreline use. An environmental impact
statement (EIS) is not required under RCW 43.21C.030(2). This decision was made after
review of a completed environmental checklist and other information on file with the lead
agency. This information is available to the public upon request.
This Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS) is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2). The City will
not act on this proposal for 14 days from the date of issue. Comments must be submitted by
5:00 p.m. by the closing of the comment deadline. The Responsible Official will reconsider the
DNS based on timely comments and may retain, modify, or, if significant adverse impacts are
likely, withdraw the DNS. No permits may be issued, and the applicant shall not begin work,
until the comment deadline has expired and any other necessary permits are issued.
There is no administrative appeal opportunity for this Determination. Appeals may be filed at
the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Pierce County within 21 days after the building
permit is issued. Appeals to the Superior Court shall be taken in accordance with procedures
and limitations set forth in RCW 43.21C.075. A copy of the appeal shall be filed with
Community and Economic Development – Building and Land Use Services, and with the City
Attorney’s Office, 747 Market Street, Tacoma, WA 98402.

                          Review

Shirley,
Thank you for your patience. The City Engineering Division has reviewed the
applicant’s proposal and draft Traffic Impact Analysis conducted by Transportation Engineering
Northwest to remove approx. 66,620 sf of existing medical-office uses and construct a new
89,000 sf hospital wing for a 120 bed psychiatric facility at South 19th & Union Avenue. After
consideration of the applicant’s AM and PM peak hour analysis, we have determined that the
applicant and representative have conducted a reasonable analysis. The analysis of the new
trips as presented does not appear to adversely impact the City’s arterial street system;
therefore no mitigation is required.

No further traffic analysis is required; however a signed, final analysis is required. If the project
scope changes and SEPA is triggered, then a new SEPA review, permit, and mitigation, as
determined necessary, will apply at that time. Additional traffic comments may be provided
through the Building Permit process and other regulations include to improve onsite
circulation. If you have any additional questions, please contact me at 591-5511.

SUBJECT:     Allenmore Behavioral 120 Bed Hospital Wing ă Traffic and Parking Impact Analysis
             TENW Project No. 3383 DRAFT FOR CITY REVIEW
This memorandum summarizes the results of a traffic and parking impact analysis associated with a
proposed redevelopment at the existing Multicare Allenmore Hospital campus that would result in
removing approximately 66,620 square-feet of existing medical office uses and construct a new
89,000 square-foot hospital wing for a 120-bed psychiatric facility known as the Allenmore
Behavioral 120 Bed Hospital Wing. Predominately supporting specialty office and diagnostic
specialists, the existing 55 providers with approximately 150 employees within the existing
medical offices space would be relocated to other off-campus buildings.

Project Description
The proposed Behavioral Hospital project is located at the southeast quadrant of the Union Avenue
S and S 19th Street signalized intersection within the western portion of the Multicare Allenmore
Hospital campus. A project site vicinity map is shown in Figure 1 and a conceptual site design in
Figure 2. Vehicular site access to would be maintained at two existing driveways; one full access
driveway onto Union Avenue N approximately 650 feet south of S 19th Street and the other via the
southern leg of the signalized intersection of S Lawrence Street and S 19th Street. An existing
surface parking supply of approximately 156 stalls would be increased to 194, a net increase of
38 stalls afforded with a reduced overall building footprint over existing conditions. Project
completion is expected by 2017.

Existing Conditions
The site area is generally served by the S Union Avenue and S 19th Street arterials, both
multimodal corridors with a five lane roadway sections, and frequent transit services. Union Street
is ranges between 54 and 70 feet in width adjacent to the site, while S 19th Street is
approximately 55 feet. Adequate entering sight distance from the existing driveway onto S Union
Street is provided, exceeding 600 feet north or south. Pierce Transit routes 2, 51, and 57 serve
the Union Avenue and 19th Street corridors, provides bi-directional service in frequencies of less
than 20 minutes during peak hours and approximately 30 minutes during midday/evening hours.

Traffic Impact Analysis
The following section describes estimated new vehicle trips generated by the proposed Allenmore
Behavioral 120 Bed Hospital Wing development, a parking impact analysis, and identification of
any mitigation to offset impacts.


Project Trip Generation

Trip generation equations compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation, 9th Edition, 2012, were used to estimate daily, a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic that
would be generated by the proposed redevelopment assuming new Hospital Uses (ITE Land Use
Code 610) and removal of the existing Medical Office Building (ITE Land Use Code 210). As
shown in Table 1, an estimated net increase of approximately 600 daily, 1 new a.m. peak hour (-
25 entering and 26 exiting), and 40 fewer p.m. peak hour vehicular trips (5 entering and -45
exiting) would be generated at full redevelopment of the project. A detailed summary of trip
generation calculations is provided in Attachment A.

Site Access Impacts

As noted in the Project Description, site access is proposed to would be maintained at two existing
driveways; one full access driveway onto Union Avenue N approximately 650 feet south of S 19th
Street and the other via the southern leg of the signalized intersection of S Lawrence Street and S
19th Street. While it is estimated that a reduction in site traffic would be generated during the pm
peak hour (nearly 40 fewer trips), traffic operational analysis of existing conditions versus proposed
conditions was conducted during the highest volume of traffic of adjacent street traffic (the p.m.
peak hour). Traffic counts were conducted at these two site driveways in January 2015 after travel
conditions had normalized (holiday breaks were done, public school was back in session, and no
adverse weather was present). These counts are provided in Attachment B.

Traffic operations at either intersection under conditions with and without the project are
summarized in Table 3, using methods and procedures as outlined in the Highway Capacity
Manual‰, Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, 2010. As shown, a net benefit in
overall intersection operation would occur as a result of the proposed Allenmore Behavioral 120
Bed Hospital Wing on the stop controlled driveway approach, and therefore, no traffic mitigation
is warranted for traffic impacts. The City however, will require the applicant to rebuild the property

Parking Impact Analysis
A parking impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the removal of existing supply/demand
generated by existing uses and proposed supply and estimated demand associated with the
proposed Allenmore Behavioral 120 Bed Hospital Wing project. The parking impact analysis
reviewed:
      City of Tacoma parking requirements.
      Total off-street parking supply.


City of Tacoma Parking Requirements

Based upon City of Tacoma off-street parking standards (Tacoma Municipal Code Title 13.06.510
ă Off-Street Parking and Storage Areas, Table 1), Table 2 summarizes minimum off-street parking
stalls required. City code would normally require 1.75 off-street parking stalls per bed for the
proposed hospital use, or 210 stalls. However, given the proposed institutional use is within less
than 500 feet of transit services on both Union Avenue and 19th Street frontage that operate at 20
minute headways during peak hours, a 25 percent reduction is allowed, reducing the minimum
number of stalls down to 1.31 stalls per bed. Under this allowed code reduction, 158 stalls would
be required at a minimum. As the applicant proposes to provide 194 stalls, this supply would
exceed the minimum code requirement by 36 stalls.

Conclusions
The proposed Allenmore Behavioral 120 Bed Hospital Wing development was evaluated for traffic
and parking demands. A net increase of approximately 60 new daily, 1 new a.m. peak hour
trips, and 39 fewer p.m. peak hour vehicular trips are estimated to be generated by the proposed
redevelopment. Cumulatively however, the net change in redevelopment is not expected to
generate any significant adverse traffic impacts. City code requires the project to provide 158
parking stalls on-site. The applicant is proposing 194 stalls, which exceeds this minimum
requirement by 36 stalls.
