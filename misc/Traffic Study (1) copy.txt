Subject:       1001 Minor Transportation/Parking Analysis (DPD # 3019363)

This memorandum summarizes the transportation and parking analysis completed for the
proposed residential and retail project located at 1001 Minor Avenue in Seattle, WA. The scope of
this analysis was coordinated with City of Seattle staff. The proposed development plan,
anticipated trip generation, review of access operations, and anticipated peak parking demand are
reviewed.

Project Description
The project is located at 1001 Minor Avenue on the west side of Minor Avenue, north of Madison
Street. The site is currently occupied by an approximately 4,200 square feet fast food restaurant
without drive-through with driveways located on both Madison Street and Minor Avenue. The
project site carries a NC3P-160 Zoning designation.

The proposed project includes residential/retail use with up to 207 residential apartment units and
approximately 5,300 gsf of ground floor retail space. Site access would be consolidated to a single
driveway located along Minor Avenue north of Madison Street at the eastern property line of the
project site. Approximately 160 parking spaces would be provided. Garbage pick-up is proposed
along Minor Avenue and would be wheeled out onto Minor on an as needed bases for pick-up,
likely 2 to 3 times per week. The project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018.
The first floor site plan is shown in Figure 1.

Transportation Network
The following provide a summary of the key roadways in the vicinity of the site.

Madison Street is classified as a principal arterial by the City of Seattle and accommodates two-
way traffic with a center two-way left turn-lane. Parking is allowed on the south side of the street
except during the PM peak hour from 3 to 7 PM. Sidewalks are provided along both sides of the
street within the vicinity of the project site. King County Metro operates two routes with stops in the
vicinity of the proposed project along Madison Street. Route 12 operates at approximately 10–15
minute headways depending on the time of day. This route connects between downtown Seattle
with the Capitol Hill and First Hill neighborhoods. Route 60 operates at approximately 20-30
minute headways depending on the time of day. This route operates between Broadway and
White Center with stops in First Hill, Beacon Hill, and Georgetown.

Minor Avenue is classified as an access street by the City of Seattle and accommodates two-way
traffic with on-street parking on both sides of the street. In the site vicinity, north of Madison Street,
on-street parking is part of the restricted parking zone (RPZ) 21 but paid 2-hour parking is allowed
for non-permit holding vehicles.

In addition to the current transit service described above, improvements to First Hill Streetcar are
underway in the area. The City of Seattle is constructing Streetcar stations throughout the First Hill
neighborhood. The closest station is located along Broadway at Marion Street, approximately one-
quarter of a mile away or approximately a 5 to 6 minute walk. The First Hill Streetcar will provide
connectivity between First Hill and Pioneer Square with stops along S Jackson Street near King
Street Station.

Trip Generation
Trip generation estimates have been prepared for the project based on trip rates identified using
the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (2012) and
consideration for average vehicle occupancies and mode splits typical the First Hill neighborhood.
This methodology has been approved by City staff and is consistent with previous studies
conducted in the area.

Some ITE land uses represent vehicle trip rates observed in more suburban settings than the
proposed project. To calibrate the trip generation to the local character of the proposed project, the
vehicle trips based on ITE trip rates are converted to person trips through the use of average
vehicle occupancy (AVO) rates derived from NCHRP Report 365. Once person trips were derived,
local mode split information was applied to arrive at transit, non-motorized, carpool and single
occupant vehicles (SOV) trips. Person trips by mode were determined by multiplying the person
trips by the estimated mode splits.

The basis of residential trip generation was ITE Apartment (#220) land use and mode splits from
the American Community Survey (ACS) data1 for the First Hill neighborhood. The proposed retail
trip generation was based on ITE Specialty Retail (#826) land use due to the proposed small size
and neighborhood serving use. The retail would serve the local area including residents and
employees living and working nearby. This would result in a high proportion of walking trips to and
from the surrounding neighborhood. The analysis assumes that 10 percent of the retail customers
would drive to the site.

Table 1 summarizes the resulting net new weekday daily, AM and PM peak hour vehicle trip
generation. Trip credits for the existing uses were estimated using a similar method as described
above, with the exception of the weekday PM peak hour. Weekday PM peak hour trips for the
existing fast food restaurant without drive-through were based on driveway counts conducted in
June 2015. No pass-by data was collected; therefore, the pass-by rate was based on ITE Trip
Generation Handbook, 3rd Edition (2014). Detailed trip generation calculations for the proposed
development are provided in Attachment A.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.


As shown in the Table 1, the development is anticipated to generate approximately 30 net new
vehicular weekday daily trips with a net decrease in trips during the weekday AM peak hour and 3
additional trips occurring during the weekday PM peak hour. Due to the consolidation of driveways
it is anticipated that Minor Avenue may experience a slight increase in traffic volumes.

Driveway Evaluation
There is no alley available for site so garage access is proposed along Minor Avenue. Traffic
operations at the site access were evaluated for the weekday PM peak hour period. Future 2018
traffic volumes were forecast by increasing existing traffic counts2 along Minor Avenue by 2.5-
percent per year and adding project generated traffic. This growth rate was determined from
forecasts included in the Swedish Cherry Hill Final Environmental Impact Statement.3 Growth
rates for other studies in the City of Seattle are typically 1.0 or 1.5 percent per year and the site
access is located on a local residential street, which typically experience little to no growth. Based
on this, a 2.5-percent growth rate provides a conservative estimate of future traffic volumes on
Minor Avenue.

Project trips were assigned to the driveway turning movements based on the roadway network in
the project vicinity and existing work travel patterns of residents living within ¼ mile of the site.4 It
is anticipated that traffic associated with the development would travel to/from the south and west
along Madison Street and Boren Avenue. The total proposed project traffic was then added to
2018 weekday PM peak hour background traffic volumes to estimate traffic volumes at the site
access driveway under buildout conditions.

Intersection level of service (LOS) for future with-project conditions were evaluated at the site
access driveway using the Synchro 9 software program based on the procedures identified in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM, 2010). At side-street stop-controlled intersections such as
access driveways, LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour of traffic

detailed explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

The site access with Minor Avenue is anticipated to operate at LOS B on the eastbound approach
with approximately 10 seconds of delay per vehicle. A detailed LOS worksheet is included in
Attachment D.

Parking Analysis
An analysis of the parking code requirements, and the proposed parking supply and demand for
the proposed project was completed. The following sections describe parking supply requirements
under the City of Seattle parking code, the proposed parking supply, and the estimated peak
parking demand of the project.

Parking Code Requirements
Auto Parking Requirements. Because this project is located in an Urban Center no parking is
required by Code; however, the proposal includes 160 on-site parking spaces, in a secure garage.

Bicycle Parking Requirements. Secure covered bike storage for at least 52 bicycles would be
provided on-site with access to Minor Avenue. In addition, short term bicycle parking is proposed
along Madison Street. Per SMC 23.54.015, bicycle parking is required to be provided by new
developments. The SMC requires long-term and short-term bicycle parking for the retail uses and
long-term bicycle parking for the residential component of the development. The short-term and
long-term bicycle parking requirements are shown in Table 2.

1.   DU = Dwelling Unit, SF = Square Feet
2.   From Seattle Municipal Code 23.54.015, Table E.


The proposed development is required to provide 2 short-term bicycle parking spaces and 52
long-term bicycle parking spaces. Short-term spaces are generally provided on the street for easy
access for the retail customers of the site. Long-term spaces are located off-street to provide
secure storage for tenants and employees.

The proposed project meets all Code requirements for auto and bicycle parking.

On-Site Parking Supply
The proposed project would provide secured on-site parking for 160 residential parking spaces,
below-grade. The parking garage will be accessed via a 22 foot wide driveway on Minor Avenue.

Parking Demand
Parking demand for a residential development peaks during nighttime conditions, after 10:00 p.m.
The weekday peak parking demand for the proposed residential units was estimated using local
vehicle ownership rates from US Census data. 5 The peak parking demand for this type of
residential project is expected to be below national averages because the project is located near
frequent transit service and is well-connected with bicycle and pedestrian facilities described
earlier. Based on local vehicle ownership rates and the proposed mix of residential units, a peak
parking demand rate of 0.49 vehicles per dwelling unit was estimated. This results in a weekday
peak resident parking demand of 101 vehicles. The detailed ownership rate calculations are
provided in Attachment E. This estimated peak demand would be accommodated by the proposed
supply of 160 parking spaces. The parking garage is anticipated to be secured and would not
accommodate visitor parking.

Residential visitor parking demand peaks in the early evening hours. Residential visitor peak
parking demand rates are 0.15 vehicles per dwelling unit based on information provided in Shared
Parking (ULI, 2nd Edition). This results in a visitor weekday peak parking demand of
approximately 31 vehicles. It is assumed that visitors associated with the residential uses will be
accommodated by on-street parking within the project vicinity.

In addition to the residential parking demand, weekday retail parking demand was calculated
based on Parking Generation (ITE, 4th Edition). A rate of 2.55 stalls per 1,000 square feet, which
is reduced by the mode split of vehicles representing only 10 percent of anticipated retail travel,
gives a rate of 0.26 stalls per 1,000 square feet of retail. Using these rates, the anticipated peak
parking demand is estimated to be 2 vehicles for the retail land use and is anticipated to be
accommodated on-street within the project vicinity.

An off-site peak parking demand of approximately 33 is anticipated and is comprised of 31
residential visitor vehicles and 2 retail vehicles. This off-site peak parking demand is anticipated to
occur after 7 PM.

A review of the 2014 SDOT parking study was conducted in the area to determine if the
anticipated off-site peak parking demand could be accommodated on-street. The review was
conducted for the anticipated peak parking demand during the 7 p.m. evening hour. Parking
availability was reviewed within approximately an 800-foot and 1,200-foot walking distance from
the project site. This review showed that approximately 22 parking stalls are available to be used
by visitors and retail patrons within 800-feet and 54 are available within 1,200-feet of the project
site. The anticipated off-site peak parking demand can be met within a 1,200-foot walking radius
from the project site. Thus, evening visitor and retail demand can be accommodated in the
immediate area. In addition, as described in the discussion of the transportation network, the site
is within close proximity of bus and streetcar service. Drivers having difficulty finding parking may
consider other modes.

Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with one of
the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The system,
described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning Code, is
designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation facilities would
be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. Screenlines are imaginary lines
drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from one side to the other. The
screenlines that were analyzed for concurrency review include South of S Jackson Street – 12th

 Selected Economic Characteristics (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2011), Commuting to Work,
Census Tract 83 combined (Report #B25044).
Avenue S to Lakeside Avenue S (Screenline 10.12) and East of the Central Business District
(CBD) (Screenline 12.12, as shown in Table 3. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all
project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the screenlines would extend across the
screenlines included in this analysis. Some directional traffic is anticipated to be reduced with
completion of the proposed project, as a conservative estimate reduced volumes were not taken
into account for concurrency purposes.

2.   Direction: NB = Northbound, SB = Southbound, EB = Eastbound, WB = Westbound


The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project, the
screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus, the project would
meet the City’s concurrency requirements.

Summary and Findings
The proposed project includes the development of a residential project with 207 units and 5,300 sf
of retail space. A parking garage with 160 stalls is proposed for residential tenants.

As noted, a total weekday peak parking demand of 101 vehicles has been estimated for the
residential uses (after 10:00 p.m.); and a total of 33 visitor and retail spaces could be demanded
between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m. The on-site supply of 160 spaces (secured) is more than adequate
to accommodate peak residential demand. Visitor and retail demand can be accommodated on-
street.

An analysis of the site driveway was conducted evaluating the weekday PM peak hour conditions.
This analysis showed that all movements to/from the driveway would operate at LOS B. As such
no operational or safety issues are anticipated with the proposed access point. Minor Avenue may
experience a slight increase in traffic volumes do to the consolidation of the driveways.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
