744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Analysis Report                               October 11, 2016




Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed hotel development at 744
& 748 San Antonio Road in Palo Alto, CA. Existing uses at the approximately 1.9-acre project site consist of light
industrial uses at 748 San Antonio Road, and office uses at 744 San Antonio Road. The project will demolish the
existing buildings and replace them with two hotel buildings totaling 297 rooms. There currently exist two right-in-
only driveways and two right-out-only driveways on northbound San Antonio Road. The project will be accessed
via one right-in-only and one-right-out-only driveway on northbound San Antonio Road.
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed
development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the procedures and
standards set forth by the City of Palo Alto and used to evaluate all new development projects in the City. The
traffic analysis estimates the amount of new traffic that would be added to the streets in the area and evaluates
the capacity of the streets to accommodate traffic increases. The potential changes in traffic conditions due to the
project are measured against the Palo Alto standards, and conclusions are drawn about whether the changes
would be substantial, which is referred to as a “significant impact” under the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA).

Project Trip Generation
The amount of traffic that is generated by new development is estimated by applying industry-standard trip
generation rates to the type and size of the particular development proposed. The standard trip generation rates
are published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Based
on ITE’s trip generation rates, the proposed hotels would generate 134 trips during the AM peak hour and 140
trips during the PM peak hour.
The project is eligible to receive credit for trips generated by the existing development on the site that would be
demolished. While these buildings are now partially vacant in anticipation of redevelopment, they were fully
occupied and generating traffic in the recent past. We can estimate the traffic that was being generated by the
existing buildings in the same fashion as for the hotel project by applying the ITE rates.
After accounting for the traffic associated with the existing buildings on the site, the hotel project is estimated to
generate less than 100 net new peak hour trips -- 88 net new trips during the AM peak hour and 87 net new trips
during the PM peak hour.
Note that these estimates are probably higher than what actually would occur because they don’t account for any
trip reduction measures that the proposed hotel plans to implement. The project has proposed a number of trip
reduction measures, collectively known as a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan. The plan includes
hotel operated shuttles and subsidized transit passes for employees, among many other measures (detailed in
Chapter 6 of this report). The estimated trip reductions are 20% for employee trips and 30% for guest trips. After
applying these reductions, the resulting new trip generation estimates are 66 new trips during the AM peak hour
and 65 new trips during the PM peak hour.


                                                                                                          Page | ii

Traffic Increase on San Antonio Road
The amount of existing traffic on San Antonio Road is about 2,100 vehicles during the AM peak hours and 2,500
vehicles during the PM peak hours. After applying the TDM reductions, the projected traffic increase due to the
project represents about a 3% increase in traffic in the AM peak hour and a 2.6 percent increase in the PM peak
hour. Without the TDM reduction, the traffic increase due to the project represents about a 4% increase in traffic
in the AM peak hour and a 3.5% increase in the PM peak hour. Either way, an increase this small would not lead
to a noticeable change in traffic conditions, as described in the intersection analysis below.

Intersection Levels of Service
Traffic analysis typically focuses on intersections, especially signalized intersections, because intersections act as
the chokepoints in the system. Traffic conditions at the intersections along San Antonio Road were evaluated
using a concept called “level of service” (LOS). Level of Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions
ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive
delays. Palo Alto city policy seeks to maintain intersection operations at LOS D or better, which is a moderate
level of congestion. While most drivers probably would prefer traffic operations better than LOS D, that desire
must be balanced with efficient use of resources for the overall transportation system. That is why Palo Alto, and
most other cities in Santa Clara County and on the Peninsula, target LOS D as the limit of acceptable congestion.
Table ES-1 shows that the intersections along San Antonio Road currently operate at LOS D or better. The
project would increase the average delay (the wait time experienced by drivers using the intersections) by 0.5
seconds or less. This change in delay would be imperceptible.
The intersection of Middlefield Road and Charleston Road would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour
under cumulative conditions (see Table ES-1). The cumulative scenario in this TIA uses a forecast year of 2030
and is consistent with the City of Palo Alto’s ongoing Comprehensive Plan Update process. In the cumulative
plus project scenario, the project would not result in any increase to the average critical delay or the critical
volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio at this intersection, and, therefore, would not have a significant impact on
intersection operations, based on the City of Palo Alto’s criteria.
Therefore, the project’s traffic impact is considered to be less than significant

Vehicle Miles Traveled
Senate Bill (SB) 743, signed in September 2013, proposed several changes to the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) for projects located in areas served by transit (i.e., transit-oriented development or TOD).
Those changes directed the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to develop new metrics (i.e. an
alternative to level of service) for analyzing transportation impacts under CEQA. Alternative metrics for
transportation impacts may include vehicle miles traveled (VMT), VMT per capita, automobile trip generation
rates, or automobile trips generated. The OPR released a preliminary discussion draft of updating transportation
impact analysis in the CEQA Guidelines in August 2014, and is still in the process of making revisions to the
guidelines.
Because the alternative approach to level of service analysis has not yet been finalized and adopted by the OPR,
no standard or approach has been developed by local agencies for SB 743. However, because VMT is one of the
alternative metrics considered, this report presents an estimate of average daily VMT for the proposed hotel. The
estimated daily VMT would be 27.8 miles per capita (per employee or per hotel guest) without any TDM
measures, which would be reduced to 19.8 miles per capita with the hotel’s proposed TDM program. This
represents a substantial reduction compared to vehicle miles traveled that are estimated to be generated by the
existing buildings, which have an estimated daily VMT of 34.4 miles per capita.




                                                                                                        Page | iii

Turn Pocket Queuing Analysis
The analysis of intersection levels of service was supplemented with a vehicle queuing analysis for turn lanes at
two intersections where the project would add a substantial number of trips to the left-turn or U-turn movements.
The turn pocket queuing analysis indicated that the existing left-turn pocket storage capacity would be sufficient to
accommodate the additional left and U-turn volumes at the two intersections on San Antonio Road that were
evaluated. Therefore, the project is not expected to generate significant intersection queuing issues.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
The project site has good connectivity to bicycle and pedestrian facilities within the project vicinity. As part of its
TDM plan, the project intends to add shuttle service to the area, which could be used by local residents in addition
to hotel guests and employees.
San Antonio Road is planned for bike lanes between Byron Street and Charleston Road, which includes the
project frontage. Because on-street parking would be prohibited along the project frontage on San Antonio Road,
the planned bike lane along San Antonio Road could be implemented between Byron Street and Charleston Road
with the project.

Site Access
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the project driveway with regard to sight distance and
traffic volumes. The proposed project would have one right-in-only and one-right-out-only driveway on northbound
San Antonio Road. All vehicles on southbound San Antonio Road would make a U-turn at Middlefield Road to
enter the project site. The queuing analysis indicates that the existing southbound left-turn pocket at San
Antonio/Middlefield is capable of servicing the additional project U-turn traffic under all project conditions. Since
project access is restricted to only right-turn-in, there is expected to be little delay for vehicles accessing the
project driveway on northbound San Antonio Road. Therefore, the project traffic is not expected to create any
driveway access problems, nor cause left-turn pocket overflows on San Antonio Road.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed hotel development at 744
& 748 San Antonio Road in Palo Alto, CA. Existing uses at the approximately 1.9-acre project site consist of light
industrial uses at 748 San Antonio Road, and office uses at 744 San Antonio Road. The project will demolish the
existing buildings and replace them with two hotel buildings totaling 297 rooms. There currently exist two right-in-
only driveways and two right-out-only driveways on northbound San Antonio Road. The project will be accessed
via one right-in-only and one-right-out-only driveway on northbound San Antonio Road. The project site and the
surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. A finalized project site plan is not available at the time of this
report.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed
development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by
the Cities of Palo Alto and Mountain View and the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). The
VTA administers Santa Clara County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM peak hour levels of service for six key signalized intersections.
Four of the study intersections are located in the City of Palo Alto, two of which are CMP intersections. Two of the
study intersections are located in the City of Mountain View. The study intersections were selected to include
locations where the proposed project is expected to generate 10 or more peak-hour trips per lane.
City of Palo Alto Study Intersections:
    1. Middlefield Road and Charleston Road,
    2. San Antonio Road and Charleston Road (CMP),
    3. San Antonio Road and Leghorn Street, and
    4. San Antonio Road and Middlefield Road (CMP),
City of Mountain View Study Intersections:
    5. Rengstorff Avenue and Leghorn Street, and
    6. Rengstorff Avenue and Middlefield Road.
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic. In
the study area, the AM peak hour is typically between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM, while the PM peak hour is typically
between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.




                                                                                                        Page | 1
744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                            October 11, 2016

The Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP) TIA
guidelines require that the CMP freeway segments be evaluated to determine the impact of added traffic for
projects that generate trips equal to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment’s capacity. The project is
not anticipated to add traffic equal to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment’s capacity (US 101 or
SR 85 freeway segments in the project vicinity). Therefore, freeway segment traffic analysis is not included in the
study.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
    Scenario 1:   Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes are based on new traffic counts conducted in the
                  year 2015, the 2012 CMP TRAFFIX database, and previous studies. The project site was not
                  fully occupied at the time that the counts were conducted at the project driveways.
    Scenario 2:   Existing plus Project Conditions. Existing traffic volumes with the project were estimated by
                  adding to existing traffic volumes the traffic generated by the proposed project less the trips
                  currently generated by the existing uses on the site. Existing plus project conditions were
                  evaluated relative to existing conditions in order to determine the effects the project would have
                  on the existing roadway network.
    Scenario 3:   Background Conditions. The background traffic volumes were derived by adding additional trips
                  associated with nearby approved but not yet constructed and occupied developments to
                  existing traffic volumes. The list of approved projects was provided by the City of Mountain
                  View and City of Palo Alto. Background conditions also account for re-occupancy of the existing
                  buildings on the project site. Additional trips associated with existing buildings on the site were
                  added to existing traffic volumes.
    Scenario 4:   Background plus Project Conditions. Background traffic volumes with the project were
                  estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the traffic generated by the proposed project
                  less the trips generated by full occupancy of the existing buildings on the site. Background plus
                  project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine
                  potential project impacts.
    Scenario 5:   Cumulative Conditions. The forecast year for the cumulative scenarios is 2030. The cumulative
                  plus project traffic volumes are based on the City of Palo Alto’s currently ongoing
                  Comprehensive Plan Update process, using the scenario that is based on the City’s previously
                  approved Comprehensive Plan for 2030 volumes. These volumes were calculated by the Palo
                  Alto travel demand forecasting model and include the proposed project. The cumulative no
                  project (or cumulative baseline) traffic volumes were estimated by subtracting the net project
                  trips (the difference between the proposed hotel and the re-occupancy of the existing buildings
                  on the project site) from the cumulative with project volumes.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described above. It
includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable level of service
standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, the City of Mountain View, the City of
Palo Alto, previous studies, and field observations. The following data were collected from these sources:

       existing traffic volumes,
       existing lane configurations,
       signal timing and phasing, and
       list of approved and pending projects.

Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to
LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are described below.

Signalized Study Intersections
Both the City of Mountain View and the City of Palo Alto level of service methodologies for signalized
intersections are the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method. This method is applied using the TRAFFIX
software. The 2000 HCM operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average
control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersection level
of service methodology, the City of Mountain View and the City of Palo Alto methodologies employ the CMP
default values for the analysis parameters. The City of Mountain View and City of Palo Alto level of service
standard for non-CMP signalized intersections is LOS D or better. The correlation between average control delay
and level of service is shown in Table 1.

CMP Intersections
The designated level of service methodology for the CMP also is the 2000 HCM operations method for signalized
intersections, using TRAFFIX. The CMP level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS E or better.
The two CMP study intersections are both located in the City of Palo Alto. The City of Palo Alto’s level of service
standard for CMP intersections is also LOS E or better.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used to
determine significant impacts on signalized intersections are based on City of Palo Alto, City of Mountain View,
and VTA’s CMP level of service standards.
The effects of the project on other transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit service, were
determined on the basis of engineering judgment.

Cities of Mountain View and Palo Alto Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection in the
City of Mountain View and City of Palo Alto if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable level (LOS D or better for non-CMP
       intersections and LOS E or better for CMP intersections) under background conditions to an
       unacceptable level (LOS E or F for non-CMP intersections and LOS F for CMP intersections), or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable level of service (LOS E or F at non-CMP
       intersections and LOS F at CMP intersections) under background conditions and the addition of project
       traffic causes both the average critical-movement delay at the intersection to increase by four (4) or more
       seconds and the critical volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by one percent (.01) or more.
An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average delay for
critical movements (i.e. the change in average delay for critical movements is negative). In this case, the
threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by City of Palo Alto and City of Mountain View standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated
when measures are implemented that would restore intersection conditions to its level of service standard or to an
average delay that is better than background conditions.

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the green
    A       phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to the very       10.0 or less
            low vehicle delay.

            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle lengths.
    B       More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average vehicle             10.1 to 20.0
            delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
    C                                                                                                20.1 to 35.0
            of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the intersection
            without stopping.
            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
            result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
    D                                                                                                35.1 to 55.0
            lengths, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
            individual cycle failures are noticeable.

            This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
    E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-         55.1 to 80.0
            to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
    F                                                                                             greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also
            be major-contributing causes of such delay levels.

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of Palo Alto. A significant
impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are implemented that would
restore intersection operations to acceptable conditions or background conditions.

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities near the site, including
the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided by US 101 and SR 85. Local access to the project site is provided
via San Antonio Road, Rengstorff Avenue, Middlefield Road, Charleston Road, Old Middlefield Way, Leghorn
Street, and Independence Avenue.
US 101 is a north-south freeway that extends through and beyond the Bay Area, connecting San Francisco to
San Jose. US 101 is eight lanes wide (three mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane in each direction) in the vicinity
of the project site. US 101 provides access to the study area via interchanges at San Antonio Road, Charleston
Road/Rengstorff Avenue, and Old Middlefield Way.
SR 85 is a north-south freeway that begins at US 101, east of N. Shoreline Boulevard, extends south towards San
Jose, and terminates at US 101 east of the Silicon Valley Boulevard/Bernal Road interchange. SR 85 is six lanes
wide (two mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane in each direction) in the vicinity of the project.
San Antonio Road is a north-south arterial that begins at Terminal Boulevard, extends south into Los Altos, and
terminates at its intersection with Fremont Avenue. Within the vicinity of the project, San Antonio Road is four
lanes wide, and is divided by a raised center median. Within the project vicinity, parking, bike routes, and
detached sidewalks are provided on both sides of San Antonio Road. San Antonio Road provides direct access to
the project site.
Rengstorff Avenue is a north-south arterial that begins north at the intersection with Charleston Road and extends
south towards its terminus at El Camino Real. Within the vicinity of the project, Rengstorff Avenue is four lanes
wide, with sidewalks and 12-foot bike lanes on both sides of the street. On-street parking is permitted within the
bike lanes.
Middlefield Road is an east-west arterial that runs parallel to US 101. It begins at the intersection of Central
Expressway in Mountain View and traverses west through Redwood City. Within the vicinity of the project site,
Middlefield Road is four lanes wide, with detached sidewalks on both sides of the street. Bike lanes are
continuous on Middlefield Road except between Montrose Avenue and San Antonio Road. On-street parking on
Middlefield Road is provided within the City of Mountain View and is permitted only between the hours of 7:00 PM
and 2:00 AM.
Charleston Road is an east-west arterial that begins east at its interchange with US 101 and extends west
towards the intersection with El Camino Real, at which point it transitions to Arastradero Road. Within the vicinity
of the project site, Charleston Road is two- to four-lanes wide, with detached sidewalks on both sides of the
street. Parking is permitted mostly on both sides of the street. Bike lanes are provided west of Fabian Way.



                                                                                                            Page | 6
744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                                October 11, 2016

Old Middlefield Way is an east-west four-lane minor arterial with on-street parking on both sides of the street. It
begins east at its interchange with US 101 and extends west towards the intersection with Middlefield Road. Old
Middlefield Way is connected with US 101 via a northbound US 101 off-ramp and a southbound US 101 on-ramp.
There exists a center two-way left-turn median along the entirety of Old Middlefield Way. Sidewalks are on both
sides of the street. Bike lanes are not provided.
Leghorn Street is an east-west local two-lane street. It begins east at its intersection with Sierra Vista Avenue,
and terminates west at its intersection with San Antonio Road. Sidewalks are on both sides of the street. Bike
lanes are not provided. On-street parking is provided on both sides of the street, but is prohibited between 2:00
AM and 6:00 AM.
Independence Avenue is a north-south local two-lane street. It begins north at its intersection with Charleston
Road, and terminates south at its intersection with Middlefield Road. Sidewalks are on both sides of the street.
Bike lanes are not provided. On-street parking is provided on both sides of the street, but is prohibited between
2:00 AM and 6:00 AM.

Bicycle Facilities
There are existing bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the project. Bike lanes provide a striped lane for one-way bike
travel on a street or highway and are designed for the exclusive use of cyclists with certain exceptions. For
instance, right turning vehicles must merge into the lane before turning, and pedestrians can use the bike lane
when there is no adjacent sidewalk. A bicycle route may be identified on a local residential or collector street
when the travel lane is wide enough and the traffic volume is low enough to allow both cyclists and motor
vehicles.
Within the project area, bike lanes are present along the entirety of Middlefield Road except between Montrose
Avenue, along Charleston Road west of Fabian Way, and along the entirety of Rengstorff Avenue. San Antonio
Road between Alma Street and Charleston Road is also a City designated bicycle route. The City of Palo Alto is
currently planning on installing bike lanes on San Antonio Road between Byron Street and Charleston Road.
Street widening or removal of on-street parking along some segments on San Antonio Road may be required to
accommodate the planned bike lanes. Local roads like Independence Avenue and Leghorn Street carry lower
traffic volumes and may be conducive to bicyclists.
The Permanente Creek Trail is a Class I shared pedestrian/bicycle path that is located approximately 1 mile east
of the project site. The Permanente Creek Trail extends from Shoreline at Mountain View over US 101, under Old
Middlefield Road and currently ends at Rock Street. This paved multi-use path provides an important pedestrian
and bicycle connection between residential neighborhoods on the south side of US 101 with businesses and
recreational facilities on the north side of US 101.
The existing bicycle facilities within the study area are shown on Figure 2.
Hexagon conducted pedestrian and bicycle counts during the peak commute hours at all study intersections
except the intersection of Rengstorff Avenue and Middlefield Road, which is under construction at the time of this
report. The pedestrian/bike counts are included in Appendix A. The counts indicate that bike activity within the
study area is moderate. During both the AM and PM peak periods, the intersection of Middlefield Road and
Charleston Road had the highest amount of bicycle traffic, with 78 bikes per hour in the AM peak period and 51
bikes per hour in the PM peak period. All other study intersections had fewer bicycles, ranging between 10 to 30
bikes per hour in the AM peak period, and 20 to 35 bikes per hour in the PM peak period. The higher bicycle
volume at the intersection of Middlefield Road and Charleston Road is attributed to the well-established bicycle
facilities on Middlefield Road and on Charleston Road, as well as the intersection’s proximity to Challenger
School, which is located at the northwest corner of this intersection.

Pedestrian Facilities
Sidewalks are present along both sides of all study area roadways. All study intersections have signalized
crosswalks with pedestrian push buttons on all legs.




                                                                                                            Page | 7
744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                               October 11, 2016

Pedestrian traffic is moderate within the study area. During both the AM and PM peak periods, the intersection of
Middlefield Road and Charleston Road had the highest amount of pedestrian traffic, with 74 pedestrians per hour
in the AM peak period and 61 pedestrians per hour in the PM peak period. All other study intersections had less
pedestrian traffic, ranging between 15 to 40 pedestrians per hour in the AM peak period, and 25 to 45 pedestrians
per hour in the PM peak period.

Transit Service
VTA Bus Service
Existing bus service to the study area is provided by the VTA. The transit services are described in Table 2 and
shown on Figure 3. All transit services described in Table 2 stop within walking distance of the project site.

Notes:
* This bus route does not provide services during the AM and PM peak commute hours or mid-day period.
1. Approximate headways during peak commute periods.
2. Express Route 104 operates westbound towards Deer Creek during only the AM peak commute period with two
buses. Route 104 operates eastbound towards Penitencia Creek during only the PM peak commute period with two buses.

The Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) Orange Shuttle (Route 824) also serves the project area. ACE provides
commuter rail service between Stockton, Tracy, Pleasanton, and San Jose during commute hours. This free
shuttle, funded by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, transports Palo Alto/Mountain View passengers
to and from the ACE Great America Station in Santa Clara. Service is limited to four westbound trips in the
morning and four eastbound trips in the afternoon/evening with headways averaging 60 minutes. The shuttle stop
closest to the project site is located at Fabian Way and Charleston Road, approximately ½ mile northwest of the
project site.
The Palo Alto Shuttle Service is a free shuttle program funded by the City of Palo Alto. This program currently
operates three lines: 1) East Palo Alto Caltrain Shuttle (EPA) services residents between the City of East Palo
Alto and the Palo Alto Caltrain Station; 2) Embarcadero Shuttle (E) provides services between the California
Avenue Caltrain Station and the Baylands Business Parks; and 3) Crosstown Shuttle (C) connects Downtown
Palo Alto to South Palo Alto at Charleston Road. Within the project limits, the C shuttle stops at the intersection of
Middlefield Road and Charleston Road, approximately ½ mile west of the project site.

Caltrain Service
Commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy is provided by Caltrain. The project site is located about
one mile north of the San Antonio Caltrain station. Caltrain provides service with approximately 20- to 30-minute
headways during the weekday AM and PM commute hours and 60 minute headways midday, at nights and on
weekends. Sidewalks exist on most of the routes between the project site and the Caltrain station. Bus routes 32
and 35 also provide connection between the project site and the Caltrain station.

Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained by observations. The intersection of
Rengstorff Avenue and Middlefield Road is under construction at the time of this report. Lane configurations at
Rengstorff/Middlefield are obtained from previous studies that included this intersection. The existing intersection
lane configurations are shown on Figure 4.

Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new traffic counts conducted in March 2015, the 2012 VTA’s CMP
TRAFFIX database, and previous studies. The intersection of Rengstorff Avenue and Middlefield Road is under
construction at the time of this report. Existing traffic volumes at Rengstorff/Middlefield are obtained from previous
studies that included this intersection. The existing AM and PM peak-hour intersection volumes are shown on
Figure 5. The traffic count data are included in Appendix A.

Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against the City of Mountain View, City of Palo Alto, and CMP
standards. The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in
Table 3. The results of the analysis show that all study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels (LOS D
or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours. The intersection levels of service calculation sheets are
included in Appendix B.

744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                                October 11, 2016


Observed Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated intersection levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing
traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the level
of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing traffic conditions.
During the weekday morning commute hours, traffic is heavy on northbound San Antonio Road and on Middlefield
Road. At the intersection of San Antonio Road and Middlefield Road, the northbound through traffic queues to
Nita Avenue, approximately 2,000 feet south of the stop-line. The lengthy queue constantly requires two signal
cycles to clear, and blocks the northbound left-turn pocket, forcing approximately half of all northbound left-turn
traffic to wait at least one cycle in the through lanes. At the intersection of San Antonio Road and Charleston
Road, the northbound through movement constantly queues towards Leghorn Street, and occasionally extends
past Leghorn Street. However, the northbound queues are able to clear within one signal cycle. Vehicles going in
and out of Leghorn Street are not delayed. The southbound left-turn movement on San Antonio Road at the
intersection with Charleston Road is constantly full and occasionally overflows out of the existing turn pocket, and
requires two signal cycles to clear the queue. At the intersection of Middlefield Road and Charleston Road, the
northbound, southbound, and eastbound left-turn pockets are constantly full and occasionally overflow; all left-turn
vehicles clear within one signal cycle. Since the morning commute hours coincide with the peak drop-off period
for the nearby Challenger School located at the northwest corner of the intersection, pedestrian and bicycle
activities on the north and west crosswalks are relatively heavy. Southbound right-turn vehicles on Middlefield
Road must wait for all pedestrians and bicycles to clear before turning off southbound Middlefield Road. As a
result, southbound Middlefield Road sometimes develops a lengthy queue on only the outer lane, and not all
vehicles can clear within one signal cycle.
During the weekday evening commute hours, traffic is heavy on San Antonio Road and Middlefield Road. At the
intersection of San Antonio Road and Charleston Road, the northbound through movement is heavy, but clears
within one signal cycle. The southbound left-turn movement constantly overflows the turn pocket, queues
approximately 600 feet north from the stop-line, and occasionally requires two signal cycles to clear the queue.
The eastbound left-turn movement on Charleston Road at San Antonio Road constantly fills the left-turn pocket,
and occasionally requires two signal cycles to clear. At the intersection of San Antonio Road and Middlefield
Road, the eastbound through-movement traffic on Middlefield Road constantly queues past Montrose Avenue,
which is approximately 900 feet west of the stop-line, but all vehicles clear within one signal cycle. The eastbound
right-turn movement is also heavy, and often cannot clear within its designated green time. However, the left-turn
phases on San Antonio Road create clearance time for the eastbound right-turn movement, which is enough to
clear the remaining queue. The westbound left-turn movement on Middlefield Road at San Antonio Road
constantly overflows the turn pocket, queues approximately 600 feet east from the stop-line, and requires two
signal cycles to clear. This westbound left-turn queue blocks one eastbound through lane, creating a temporary
bottleneck on eastbound Middlefield Road. At the intersection of Middlefield Road and Charleston Road, there
exists heavy southbound left-turn traffic on Middlefield Road that occasionally overflows its turn pocket and
requires two signal cycles to clear.
This study recognizes that during the AM peak period, vehicles sometimes cannot clear the intersection in one
cycle on the northbound through movement at San Antonio Road/Middlefield Road, the southbound left-turn
movement at San Antonio Road/Charleston Road, and the southbound right-turn movement at Middlefield
Road/Charleston Road. Similar delay issues are observed during the PM peak period for the southbound and
eastbound left-turn movements at San Antonio Road/Charleston Road, the westbound left-turn movement at San
Antonio Road/Middlefield Road, and at the southbound left-turn movement at Middlefield Road/Charleston Road.
However, vehicles on other movements at these intersections do not experience delays longer than one signal
cycle. The level of service definition and methodology represents an average of all movements at an intersection.
Thus, if one movement is congested, but the other movements do not experience lengthy delays, the average
level of service can be acceptable.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter presents traffic conditions under the existing plus project scenario. Existing plus project traffic
conditions could potentially occur if the project were to be occupied prior to the other approved projects in the
area. It is unlikely that this traffic condition would occur, since other approved projects expected to add traffic to
the study area would likely be built and occupied during the time the project is going through the development
review process. This scenario describes a less congested traffic condition, since it ignores any potential traffic
from prior approvals. It also does not account for the trips that would be generated by the existing buildings on the
project site when they were occupied.
The project will demolish the existing buildings and replace them with two hotel buildings totaling 297 rooms. The
project will be accessed via one right-in-only and one-right-out-only driveway on northbound San Antonio Road.

Roadway Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions, including
roadways and intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under existing conditions.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would appear are
estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In
determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is estimated for the AM
and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of the directions to and from which
the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project trips are assigned to specific streets and
intersections. These procedures are described below.

Trip Generation
Daily and peak-hour trip generation for the proposed project were based on trip rates published in the ITE Trip
Generation Manual, 9h Edition for a motel (Land Use 320). The project would provide the features that are similar
to the characteristics defined in the Trip Generation Manual for a motel, which would include an outdoor pool, a
fitness room, a breakfast area, and other supporting facilities similar. The Trip Generation Manual also includes
trip rates for the land use categories called hotel and business hotel. The hotel trip rates include trips generated
by on-site restaurants, lounges, meeting and banquet rooms, and convention facilities. The project would not
include these facilities, and using the hotel trip rates would over-estimate the project trips. The trip rates for
business hotels are based on very few surveys, and would not provide reasonable trip estimates for the project.
Therefore, the motel trip rates were used for the study.




                                                                                                       Page | 15
744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                                                          October 11, 2016


As shown in Table 4, the project is expected to generate a total of 1,672 daily trips with 134 trips (48 in and 86
out) during the AM peak hour and 140 trips (76 in and 64 out) during the PM peak hour. These trips would
primarily be generated by employees and guests. Because employees and guests would have very different trip
distributions, it is necessary to determine how many of the total trips are generated by employees and guests.
The project is anticipated to have 50 employees, including front desk, food and beverage, housekeeping, and
engineering, working on the site at different schedules. Peak-hour trips that would be generated by the employees
were estimated based on the employee shift schedules for other similar hotels in Palo Alto. Employee daily trips
were estimated assuming an average of three trips per employee. Daily and peak-hour trips that would be
generated by hotel guests were estimated by subtracting employee trips from total hotel trips.
Under the existing plus project scenario, trips generated by the current site uses were subtracted from the total
project trips to estimate the net new trips generated by the project. Hexagon conducted driveway counts at all
driveways associated with the project site. The driveway counts show that the existing buildings on site currently
generate 10 trips (5 in and 5 out) during the AM peak hour and 13 trips (6 in and 7 out) during the PM peak hour.
Therefore, the project is expected to generate a net 124 trips (43 in and 81 out) during the AM peak hour, and 127
trips (70 in and 57 out) during the PM peak hour. The trip generation estimates are shown on Table 4.
It should be noted that the project site was not fully occupied at the time that the existing traffic volumes were
collected at the study intersections and at the project driveways. Therefore, the driveway counts were
considerably lower than the trips that could be generated by the existing buildings if they were fully occupied,
thereby resulting in much higher trip generation estimates than would have resulted if the trip generation
estimates at full occupancy (discussed in Chapter 5 and presented in Table 6) had been credited. Recent case
law has upheld use of a traffic baseline that assumes full occupancy for vacant sites. Nonetheless, for the
purpose of presenting the most conservative analysis for the Existing Plus Project Conditions scenario, only the
actual driveway trip counts were credited against the project’s estimated trip generation (not the estimated trips at
full occupancy of the existing buildings).
The project will implement a transportation demand management (TDM) plan to reduce vehicle trips generated by
the employees and guests. The TDM programs proposed by the project applicant are summarized in Chapter 6.
However, for intersection level of service analysis, the trip generation estimates do not account for trip reductions
from the TDM measures to conservatively evaluate the impact of project trips on intersection levels of service.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed project was estimated based on existing travel patterns on the
surrounding roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. For the hotel guests, it is anticipated
that a majority of the guests would be associated with businesses in the North Bayshore area in Mountain View;
therefore, a majority of guest trips would be to and from the major airports in the area (SFO and San Jose
airports) and the North Bayshore area. The assumed trip distribution patterns for employees and guests are
shown on Figure 6.
The project trips were assigned to the roadway network based on the directions of approach and departure, the
roadway network connections, and the location of project driveways. Project trip assignment assumptions and
roadway physical restraints are discussed below:

       San Antonio Road has a landscaped median between Charleston Road and Middlefield Road that
        prevents left turns to and from the project driveway on San Antonio Road. Therefore, inbound project trips
        approaching the site on southbound San Antonio Road are assumed to make a U-turn at Middlefield
        Road and access the project driveway via northbound San Antonio Road. Likewise, outbound project trips
        bound for southbound San Antonio Road are assumed to travel on northbound San Antonio Road before
        making a U-turn at Leghorn Street. Alternative routes to avoid the U-turns exist, but are at least 1 mile
        longer than performing the U-turns. The alternative routes are circuitous and not assumed to be followed.

       Within the project vicinity, there exist three US 101 interchanges, all provide only partial access to US
        101. The US 101/San Antonio interchange serves inbound project trips from both directions on US 101,
        while outbound project trips can travel only on northbound US 101. The US 101/Charleston
        Road/Rengstorff Avenue interchange serves inbound project trips from both directions on US 101, while
        outbound project trips can travel only on southbound US 101 via either the on-ramp at Charleston Road
        or Rengstorff Avenue. The US 101/Old Middlefield Way interchange serves inbound project trips from
        only northbound US 101, and outbound project trips to only southbound US 101.
The trips generated by the existing land uses were assigned to the study area roadways based on estimated trip
distribution pattern for employees shown on Figure 6. The existing use trips were subtracted from the proposed
project trips to derive the net new project trips. Figure 7 presents the net project trips at each study intersection.

Traffic Volumes
Traffic volumes under existing plus project conditions were estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the net
trips generated by the proposed project. Existing plus project traffic volumes under the proposed project is
presented in Figure 8.

Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are summarized in
Table 5. The results of the analysis show that all study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable
levels (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours under existing plus project conditions.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to completion of the
proposed project. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise volumes from existing traffic counts plus
traffic generated by approved developments in the vicinity of the site. Background conditions also include full
occupancy of the existing buildings based on historical usage on the site. This chapter describes the procedure
used to determine background traffic volumes and the resulting traffic conditions. The background scenario
predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as approved developments get built and occupied.

Roadway Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions, including roadways
and intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under existing conditions at all study
intersections. The intersection of Rengstorff Avenue and Middlefield Road is under construction at the time of this
report. This report assumes that lane configuration at Rengstorff Avenue/Middlefield Road will be restored to its
original configuration prior to construction, so the lane configurations would remain the same compared to that
described under existing conditions.

Traffic Volumes
Background peak-hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak hour volumes (1) the trips
associated with the full occupancy of the existing buildings on the site and (2) the estimated traffic from approved
but not yet constructed developments. The AM and PM peak hour intersection traffic volumes under background
conditions are shown on Figure 9.

Trip Estimates for Full Occupancy of Existing Buildings
The project site was not fully occupied at the time that the existing traffic volumes were collected at the study
intersections and at the project driveways. Therefore, to account for traffic from full occupancy of existing
buildings, trip generation was estimated for existing buildings as approximately 9,425 square feet of general office
use, 7,040 square feet of medical office use, and 14,845 square feet of light industrial use, based on recent usage
of the site.
Peak-hour trip generation for the existing buildings were based on trip rates published in the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9h Edition for general office (Land Use 710), medical
office (Land use 720), and general light industrial (Land Use 110). The full occupancy of existing buildings would
generate 46 trips (38 in and 8 out) during the AM peak hour and 53 trips (11 in and 42 out) during the PM peak
hour. The driveway counts show that the existing uses on site currently generate 10 trips (5 in and 5 out) during
the AM peak hour and 13 trips (6 in and 7 out) during the PM peak hour. Therefore, new trips generated by full
occupancy of the existing buildings are expected to be 36 trips (33 in and 3 out) during the AM peak hour, and 40

trips (5 in and 35 out) during the PM peak hour. The trip generation estimates for the existing buildings are shown
on Table 6.
The net peak-hour trips generated by the existing buildings were assigned to the roadway network based on the
trip distribution patterns described in Chapter 3 (see Figure 6). Net full occupancy trips were added to existing
intersection traffic counts to derive the traffic volumes that reflect the typical traffic conditions when the existing
buildings are fully occupied.

    Daily trips for 748 San Antonio Road are estimated based on the ratio of daily to PM peak hour trip rates for General Light Industrial (110).


Approved Developments
Background traffic volumes were forecast by estimating trip generation for a list of approved but not yet
constructed and occupied projects provided by the City of Mountain View and City of Palo Alto. Following is the
list of approved projects within the vicinity of the proposed project that are considered in the background scenario:
City of Mountain View Approved Developments:
    1. Intuit – 2600 Marine Way (231,000 s.f. net new office space)
    2. Merlone Geier Partners (MGP) Phase II – 405 San Antonio Road (360,909 s.f. office, 107,835 s.f. retail,
       1410 seats cinema, and 167 rooms hotel)
    3. Windsor Academy – 908 Rengstorff Avenue (84-child daycare center, replacing 1 single-family house)
    4. Northpark Apartments – 111 Rengstorff Avenue (net 84-unit apartment)
    5. City Ventures – 1951 Colony Street (33 unit rowhouse project)
    6. ROEM/Eden – 819 Rengstorff Avenue (48 affordable rental studios with 1,600 s.f. retail, replacing 12
       residential units and 8,500 s.f. of retail)
    7. UDR – 1984 El Camino Real (160-unit apartment with 4,000 s.f. retail)
    8. SummerHill Apartments – 2650 El Camino Real (193-unit apartment replacing a 60-unit motel and 5,600
       s.f. of retail)
Of the 8 approved projects in City of Mountain View, trips from only the Intuit, MGP Phase II, Windsor Academy,
and Northpark Apartments would generate traffic on the study intersections and are therefore included as part of
the background scenario. The remaining considered projects are not included as part of the background scenario.

There are no approved projects in the City of Palo Alto within the vicinity of the project area.
Peak-hour trip generation for all included approved projects was based on their respective traffic reports provided
by City staff. Trip generation estimates for the approved developments are shown on Table 7. The approved
project trips were then added to existing intersection traffic counts to derive the background traffic volumes.

Background Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes traffic conditions that would occur when the project is complete. It describes the method by
which project traffic is estimated and discusses any impacts caused by the project. Background plus project
conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

Roadway Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background plus project conditions, including
roadways and intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under background conditions
at all study intersections.

Project Trip Estimates
Daily and peak-hour trip generation estimates for the project are described in Chapter 3. The project is expected
to generate a total of 1,672 daily trips with 134 trips (48 in and 86 out) during the AM peak hour and 140 trips (76
in and 64 out) during the PM peak hour.
The project will receive credit for trips generated by the existing occupied buildings on the site. As discussed in
Chapter 4 , the full occupancy of existing buildings are expected to generate 461 daily trips with 46 trips (38 in
and 8 out) during the AM peak hour and 53 trips (11 in and 42 out) during the PM peak hour (see Table 6).
Therefore, the project is estimated to generate a net increase of 1,211 new daily trips with 88 trips (10 in and 78
out) during the AM peak hour, and 87 trips (65 in and 22 out) during the PM peak hour. The trip generation
estimates are shown on Table 9.
Trip distribution and assignment methods for project and existing trips are described in Chapter 3. Figure 10
presents the net project trips at each study intersection.

All trip rates are from Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation, 9th Edition, 2012.
1. Motel (Land Use 320), average rates expressed in trips per room.
2. AM and PM peak-hours trips are estimated based on the employee shift times from other similar hotels in Palo Alto. Daily trips are estimated
    assuming 3 trips per employee.
3. Trips generated by hotel guests are total hotel trips minus employee trips.
4. General Office (Land Use 710), average rates expressed in trips per 1,000 square feet (s.f.) gross leasable area.
5. Medical Office (Land Use 720), average rates expressed in trips per 1,000 s.f. gross leasable area.
6. General Light Industrial (Land Use 110), average rates expressed in trips per 1,000 s.f. gross leasable area.


Traffic Volumes
Net project trips were added to background traffic volumes to obtain background plus project traffic volumes. The
background plus project traffic volumes with the proposed project is shown on Figure 11.

Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus project conditions are summarized
in Table 10. The results of the analysis show that all study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable
levels (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours under background plus project conditions.
Average critical delay at an intersection is a weighted average of delay for critical movements on each
intersection approach. The addition of project traffic to movements with short delays can cause the overall
weighted average delay to improve. However, the volume-to-capacity ratio will always increase when traffic is
added.
Therefore, measured against the City of Mountain View, City of Palo Alto, and VTA’s CMP level of service
standards, the proposed project would have an insignificant impact on intersection levels of service at all study
intersections.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project site, including:

       Transportation demand management (TDM) programs,
       Vehicle miles traveled (VMT),
       Turn pocket queuing analysis at selected intersections,
       Potential impacts to bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities,
       Site access
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this chapter
are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by the traffic
engineering community. Although operational issues are not considered CEQA impacts, they do describe traffic
conditions that are relevant to describing the project environment.

TDM Programs
The project will implement a TDM plan to reduce vehicle trips generated by the employees and guests. The TDM
measures proposed by the project applicant are listed below. These measures are divided into four categories:
hotel TDM infrastructure, guest TDM programs, employee TDM programs, and guest & employee (dual)
programs.
Hotel TDM Infrastructure:

       Free on-site bicycle program (hotel bikes for employee and guest use).
       On-site/nearby car-share program (Zipcar/WeCar).
       On-site amenities and vending services.
       Ground floor facades, entrances, and pathways that will encourage pedestrian and bicycle movement.
       Transportation kiosk and/or mount a real-time transportation information screen in lobby.
       Passenger loading zone.
       Bicycle parking/storage for employees and guests.
       Add transit resources to the hotel’s website (e.g., free Palo Alto and Marguerite shuttles, the Bike Station,
        Caltrain, VTA, etc.)
Guest TDM Programs:

       Pre-loaded Clipper Cards available for purchase for guests’ transit travel.



                                                                                                       Page | 32
744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                             October 11, 2016


       Train reservation staff to provide transit connection information for VTA and Caltrain and transfer to
        Airport via Millbrae BART Station.
       Include hotel confirmation email with information about reaching the hotel without a vehicle.
       Place a “Getting Around Palo Alto” map/brochure in each guest room.
       Free hotel-operated shuttle to the San Jose Airport.
       Hotel-operated shuttle to the North Bayshore area. .
Employee TDM Programs:

       100% subsidized transit passes (Caltrain and VTA).
       Cash incentive/allowance for carpooling, biking and walking to work.
       Ridematching assistance.
       Free, preferential carpool/vanpool parking.
       Commuter bike program (provide commuter bikes for employees).
       Secure bike storage, showers and clothes lockers.
       Commuter rewards – fuel cards, movie tickets, gift card.
       Emergency ride-home program.
       Hotel-funded annual car-share membership.
       New employee orientation training by a designated commute coordinator.
       Annual employee TDM survey.
       Free employee overnight accommodation (subject to room availability) for employees who are scheduled
        to work a late evening shift (ending at 11:00 p.m. or later) and a morning shift the following day.
Guest & Employee (Dual) TDM Programs:

       Free hotel-operated San Antonio Caltrain Station shuttle. The shuttle will open to neighborhood for free.
       Hotel membership in Palo Alto Transportation Management Association (TMA).
       Access to on-site exercise facilities.
       Annual contribution to the Palo Alto Shuttle Program to extend route of the Crosstown shuttle to the
        project site.
It is estimated that the TDM measures, especially the hotel-operated shuttles to nearby designations and the
financial incentives and subsidized transit passes for employees, would reduce the employee trips by 20 percent
and the guest trips by 30 percent.

Vehicle Miles Traveled
Senate Bill (SB) 743, signed in September 2013, proposed several changes to the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) for projects located in areas served by transit (i.e., transit-oriented development or TOD).
Those changes directed the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to develop new metrics (i.e. an
alternative to level of service) for analyzing transportation impacts under CEQA. Alternative metrics for
transportation impacts may include vehicle miles traveled (VMT), VMT per capita, automobile trip generation
rates, or automobile trips generated. The OPR released a preliminary discussion draft of updating transportation
impact analysis in the CEQA Guidelines in August 2014, and is still in the process of making revisions to the
guidelines.
Because the alternative approach to level of service analysis has not yet been finalized and adopted by the OPR,
no standard or approach has been developed by local agencies for SB 743. However, because VMT is one of the
alternative metrics considered, this report presents an estimate of VMT for existing and proposed land uses. As
shown in Table 11, for the proposed hotel, the estimated daily VMT would be 27.8 miles per capita without any

TDM measures, which would be reduced to 19.8 miles per capita with the hotel’s proposed TDM program. This
represents a substantial reduction compared to the existing buildings, which have an estimated daily VMT of 34.4
miles per capita.

Turn Pocket Queuing Analysis
The queuing analysis is used to determine the appropriate storage lengths for the high demand turn lanes where
the project would add substantial number of trips to these movements. Vehicle queues were estimated using a
Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the
following formula:

         P (x n)      n e – ()
                             n!
Where:

         P (x n)  probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane

         n  number of vehicles in the queue per lane

         Average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles per hour)
The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand left-turn movements at intersections where
10 or more project trips were added. Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution. The
basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th percentile
maximum number of queued vehicles for a particular movement; (2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles
in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum
queue length is compared to the existing or planned available storage capacity for the movement to determine if
adequate storage is available to accommodate the 95th percentile queues. This analysis thus provides a basis for
estimating future storage requirements at intersections.
Because of the existing landscaped median on San Antonio Road at the project driveway, all vehicles accessing
the project site via southbound San Antonio Road would perform a U-turn at Middlefield Road. All vehicles exiting
the project site bound for southbound San Antonio Road would travel on northbound San Antonio Road and
perform a U-turn at Leghorn Street. Alternative routes to avoid the U-turns are circuitous, and it is assumed that
they would not be used.
The southbound left-turn pockets at San Antonio/Middlefield and northbound left-turn pocket at San
Antonio/Leghorn could thus experience added traffic as a result of the proposed project. There are two
southbound left-turn pockets at Middlefield Road, each of which is approximately 250 feet long. Since U-turns
can only be made from the pocket closest to the centerline, but left turns can be made from either pocket, the left
turn volume has been halved in order to represent the volume in the leftmost lane in the queuing analysis. The
project-related U-turns have then been added to half of the total left-turn volume to determine if that pocket would
have adequate capacity. The vehicle queuing estimates at these two locations are provided in Table 12.
The queuing analysis indicates that both the northbound left-turn pocket at San Antonio/Leghorn and the leftmost
southbound left-turn pocket at San Antonio/Middlefield would not overflow under any of the studied scenarios.
The project is expected to add minimal left-turning movements at all other study intersections. Therefore, the
project is not expected to result in inadequate left-turn storage capacity due to intersection queuing.

   Because U-turns going to the project site could only use the left-turn pocket closest to the
centerline, the capacity of only one pocket is shown and the total left-turn volumes are multiplied by
0.5 to determine if that lane has adequate capacity for the project-related U-turns.

Bicycles, Pedestrians and Transit
Bike access to the project site is provided via the existing bike lanes on Middlefield Road except between
Montrose Avenue and San Antonio Road, on Charleston Road west of Fabian Way, and Rengstorff Avenue. San
Antonio Avenue Road within the immediate vicinity of the project site is also a City-designated bike route. Local
streets such as Leghorn Street carry low traffic volumes and are conducive to bicycle travel.
In early 2015, Hexagon was involved in community workshops and discussions with the City of Palo Alto staff that
identified bicycle facility improvements on various bicycle boulevards within the City of Palo Alto. The following
improvements are identified based on the latest available information:

       Install bike lanes in both directions on Middlefield Road between Charleston Road and San Antonio
        Road.
       Install bike lanes in both directions on San Antonio Road between Byron Street and Charleston Road.
       Install ten-foot shared-use path along north side of San Antonio Road.
The identified bicycle facility improvements would provide continuous bicycle facilities within the project vicinity.
Additionally, because on-street parking would be prohibited along the project frontage on San Antonio Road, the
planned bike lane on San Antonio Road could be implemented between Byron Street and Charleston Road with
the project.
Sidewalks are present along both sides of all study area roadways. All study intersections include signalized
crosswalks with pedestrian push buttons adequate to provide a convenient and safe route for those who choose
to travel on foot.
The project site is served by four local bus routes, one express bus route, an ACE shuttle, and the Palo Alto
Crosstown Shuttle. As described above under TDM Programs, the project would provide shuttle service to the
Caltrain San Antonio Station that would be free to residents in addition to hotel guests and employees. The
nearest transit stops are located between 500 and 1,000 feet from the project site. Sidewalks are present to
facilitate pedestrian movements between the project site and the nearest transit stops.
The project impacts to the existing bicycle, pedestrian, and transit networks are expected to be insignificant.

Site Access
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site driveways with regard to corner sight distance
and traffic volumes. The proposed project would have one right-in-only and one-right-out-only driveway on
northbound San Antonio Road. All vehicles on southbound San Antonio Road would require performing a U-turn
at Middlefield Road to enter the project site.
At the intersection of San Antonio Road and Middlefield Road, the project is expected to generate 4 and 23
southbound U-turn movements during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively (Figure 10). Queuing analysis
(Table 11) has indicated that the existing southbound left-turn pocket at San Antonio/Middlefield is capable of
servicing the additional project U-turn traffic under all of existing, background, and cumulative conditions.
Since project access is restricted to only right-turn-in, there is expected to be little delay for vehicles accessing the
project driveway on northbound San Antonio Road. The project driveway would be approximately 700 feet south
of the intersection at Leghorn Street. Field observations indicate that northbound vehicles on San Antonio Road
form only minimal queues at Leghorn Street. Therefore, vehicles exiting the project driveway are not expected to
be blocked by queued northbound through traffic on San Antonio Road.

Corner Sight Distance
The project access points should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight distance, thereby
ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles traveling on adjacent
roadways. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a driver’s ability to locate a gap in traffic and see
oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists. Adequate corner sight distance (sight distance triangles) should be provided


                                                                                                          Page | 37
744 & 748 San Antonio Road Hotel Development – Traffic Impact Analysis                           October 11, 2016


at all site access points in accordance with the City’s standards. Sight distance triangles should be measured
approximately 15 feet back from the traveled way.
Sight distance requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The speed limit on northbound San Antonio
Road is 35 mph. The Caltrans recommended stopping sight distance for this roadway is 250 feet. Adjacent the
project site, northbound San Antonio Road has on-street parking and no bike lanes. Landscaping and signage
near the project site on northbound San Antonio Road needs to be designed to not infringe within the sight
distance triangle.

7.
Cumulative Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under cumulative conditions both with
and without the proposed project. Cumulative conditions reflect a horizon year of 2030, which is the forecast year
used in the ongoing Comprehensive Plan Update process in Palo Alto. Mountain View’s General Plan and San
Antonio Precise Plan also use a forecast year of 2030. Cumulative baseline (no project) conditions include full
occupancy of the existing buildings based on historical usage on the site.

Roadway Network and Traffic Volumes
The intersection lane configurations under cumulative conditions were assumed to be the same as described
under background conditions.
The City of Palo Alto is currently engaged in updating its Comprehensive Plan and has developed several
scenarios for consideration in that process. The first scenario, sometimes referred to as the “Business As Usual
scenario” is based on the build-out assumptions in the Comprehensive Plan that was previously approved. Traffic
forecasts for the year 2030 have been developed for this scenario with the Palo Alto travel demand forecasting
model for three of the study intersections that are included in this TIA, as follows:

               Middlefield Road and Charleston Road

               San Antonio Road and Charleston Road

               San Antonio Road and Middlefield Road
Therefore, 2030 traffic volumes for those three intersections were taken from the City’s 2030 Comprehensive Plan
Update Draft Environmental Impact Report, dated February 5, 2016.
The City of Mountain View adopted its 2030 General Plan in 2012 and subsequently adopted a specific area plan
for the San Antonio Area in 2014. For the intersection of Rengstorff Avenue and Middlefield Road, we have used
the 2030 traffic forecast from the City of Mountain View San Antonio Precise Plan Environmental Impact Report,
dated August 2014.
Cumulative condition traffic volumes for the two study intersections on Leghorn Street (San Antonio /Leghorn and
Rengstorff/Leghorn) were interpolated from 2030 volumes at nearby intersections.
It is assumed that these 2030 traffic volumes include the trips that would be generated by the proposed project,
and therefore represent the cumulative plus project scenario. Because the cumulative no project (cumulative
baseline) scenario would include trips associated with re-occupancy of the existing buildings on the site, the net
project trips (as described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figure 10) were subtracted from the cumulative plus project
scenario.


                                                                                                     Page | 39

The cumulative no project traffic volumes are shown on Figure 12. The intersection turning-movement volumes
under cumulative plus project conditions are depicted on Figure 13.

Intersection Levels of Service
The level of service results for the study intersections under all cumulative conditions are summarized in Table
13. The results show that both the intersections of Rengstorff/ Leghorn and Rengstorff/ Middlefield would
deteriorate from LOS C under existing and background scenarios in the PM peak hour to LOS D under cumulative
conditions. However, LOS D is defined as an acceptable level of service at both of these intersections, so this
does not represent a significant impact under the City of Mountain View’s definition.
All except one of the signalized intersections would operate at LOS D or better under cumulative conditions both
with and without the project.
The intersection of Middlefield Road and Charleston Road would deteriorate from LOS D under existing and
background scenarios in the PM peak hour to LOS E under both cumulative baseline and cumulative plus project
conditions. LOS E is defined as an unacceptable level of service by the City of Palo Alto at this intersection.
However, because the proposed project would not result in an increase in average critical delay or in the critical
V/C ratio at this intersection, the project would not result in a significant impact under the City of Palo Alto’s
criteria.
Thus, the project would not contribute to a significant cumulative impact related to intersection levels of service.
