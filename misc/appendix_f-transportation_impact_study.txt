Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                         September 28, 2016




Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed
Rocketship Redwood Academy located at 860 Charter Street in Redwood City, California. The proposed
project consists of a 480-student charter school with 25 full-time staff and 5 to 10 part-time staff serving
students in grades K-5. The school would occupy an existing warehouse with 23,200 square feet that is
currently used for classic car sales. Primary access to the main parking lot used for student drop-off and
pick-up would be provided via two driveways, one each on Charter Street and Bay Road. During the peak
hours immediately before and after school, the driveway on Charter Street would be an inbound-only
driveway, and the driveway on Bay Road would be an outbound-only driveway. School staff will be
positioned at each driveway to restrict traffic entering and exiting these driveways to right turns only during
these hours. During off-peak periods, the Charter Street driveway would be fenced and the Bay Road
driveway would serve both inbound and outbound traffic. The school also would have a small parking lot
accessible via a two-way driveway on Charter Street.

The potential impacts of the development were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the
City of Redwood City, the County of San Mateo, and the City/County Association of Governments of San
Mateo County (C/CAG). The C/CAG administers the San Mateo County Congestion Management Program
(CMP). The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM peak-hour levels of service for nine intersections.
The traffic analysis also includes an evaluation of potential impacts to bicycle, pedestrian and transit
facilities and a review of site access, on-site circulation, drop-off and pick-up operations, and parking.

Project Trip Generation Estimates
The trip generation rates used in this analysis were based on surveys conducted at five Rocketship
schools in San Jose. The observed Rocketship school trip generation rates are significantly higher than the
elementary school trip rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual,
9th Edition. The magnitude of traffic generated by the proposed school was estimated by multiplying the
observed Rocketship school trip generation rates by the proposed enrollment at the Rocketship Redwood
Academy.
Based on the surveyed trip generation rates, and crediting the trips generated by existing uses on-site, the
project is expected to generate a net 462 trips (250 inbound and 212 outbound) during the AM peak hour
and 247 trips (101inbound and 146 outbound) during the PM peak hour.
The Rocketship Redwood Academy will implement a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Program that will encourage students and employees to carpool, take transit, or use active modes of
transport to get to and from school. The TDM program is expected to reduce the vehicle trips and parking
demand generated by the Rocketship Redwood Academy compared to that observed at other Rocketship


                                                                                               Page | iii

schools in San Jose, which do not have similar TDM programs. However, to be conservative, this report
assumes no trip reductions for TDM measures.

Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under all studied scenarios are summarized in
Table ES-1.
The results of the level of service calculations show that several study intersections would operate at
unacceptable levels of service. Based on the significance criteria established by the City of Redwood City
and the County of San Mateo, the project would not cause a significant impact at any of the study
intersections.

Potential Impacts to Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit Facilities
The project proposes to add a bulb out on the southwest corner of the Bay/Charter intersection, which
would enhance pedestrian movements at the intersection. The design of the roadway geometry is subject
to San Mateo County standards and approval. Crosswalks with ADA-compliant curb ramps should be
provided at the following locations to enhance the major student walking routes to school:

       West Willow Street approach to Bay Road
       West Sweeney Avenue approach to Bay Road
       All approaches at the Bay Road/Douglas Avenue intersection (all-way stop controlled)
       West Scott Avenue approach to Spring Street
       All approaches at the Spring Street/Douglas Avenue intersection (all-way stop controlled)

It is recommended that sharrows be added to the segment of Charter Street between Spring Street and
Bay Road, a segment that is within unincorporated San Mateo County, to form a continuous bike route
between Middlefield Road and Broadway.
The study area is served by five bus routes and a Caltrain shuttle. The nearest bus stop on Broadway is
located less than one-quarter mile from the proposed school, while the nearest bus stop on Middlefield
Road is located approximately ½ mile from the project site. Continuous sidewalks are available for
pedestrians walking between the school and the nearest bus stops. The limited transit usage attributable
to this project does not warrant improvements to the existing services.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
The following modifications are recommended to improve site access and on-site circulation:

       The current prohibition of on-street parking along the project frontage on Bay Road should be
        maintained to ensure adequate sight distance at the outbound project driveway.
       The applicant should work with the County of San Mateo to prohibit on-street parking on both
        sides of the staff parking lot driveway on Charter Street to remedy the existing sight distance
        deficiency. Removal of on-street parking requires the approval of a majority of property owners in
        the vicinity.
       A buffer should be provided between the fence that borders the play area and the end parking lift
        spaces in order to facilitate maneuvers to and from these spaces.

Drop-off and Pick-up
The site plan proposes two continuous lanes throughout the main parking lot. During the peak periods
immediately before and after school, vehicles will enter the site via a right turn only from Charter Street and
proceed to the next available queuing lane. Vehicles will traverse a serpentine double lane queue and exit
the site via a right turn onto Bay Road. Student loading and unloading will occur from both lanes with


                                                                                               Page | iv
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                         September 28, 2016

assistance from support staff. Vehicles will be directed to proceed into the designated loading area in
groups when the previous vehicles have cleared the loading zone. Support staff will then escort children
between their vehicles and the designated walking path that leads to the cafeteria. During peak drop-
off/pick-up periods, Rocketship staff will monitor the inbound and outbound driveways, and on-site loading
area to ensure that vehicles obey safe loading practices and do not turn left into and out of the school.
Based on observations of drop-off and pick-up operations at other Rocketship schools in San Jose, drop-
off and pick-up queues are expected to be contained within the project site and will not extend on to
Charter Street.

Parking Supply and Dimensions
The site plan proposes a total of 36 on-site parking spaces. The project site is located partially within
unincorporated San Mateo County, and partially within the City of Redwood City. The proposed parking
supply (36 spaces) fulfills the zoning code requirements of both the City and the County and is 11 spaces
more than the projected full-time school employment.
Furthermore, the school’s TDM Program is expected to encourage school staff to carpool or use
alternative modes of transportation such that not all employees will need a parking space. Thus, there will
be parking available on site for part-time staff that arrive later in the morning, as well as parents
volunteering at the school. In addition, on-street parking is permitted on Charter Street adjacent the school
site.
The existing parking area along the western edge of the site is fully occupied at times. The applicant
reports that vehicles that currently park in this location are generated by adjacent businesses (Luxury
European, 850 Charter Street and Rebuilding Together Peninsula, 841 Kaynyne Street) and park there out
of convenience. The project is under no legal obligation to provide parking for any other business. Upon
construction of the proposed school, all vehicles associated with off-site uses would need to find parking
elsewhere.
The dimensions of the standard parking spaces meet the standards expressed in the City’s zoning code.
The proposed two van accessible spaces meet the 2013 California Building Code (CBC) requirements for
the required number of spaces and space dimensions. An access aisle is shown adjacent to the passenger
side of each space, which complies with CBC standards.
While the length of the parking lift spaces in the main lot meets the City’s requirement, the width of the
spaces falls short of the minimum for standard spaces. Thus, the lift spaces are best used by compact
vehicles. The parking spaces in the west lot are also designated as compact spaces.
The aisle width in the main parking lot meets the City’s minimum standard. However, in the west parking
lot, the aisle width falls short of the City’s requirement. The substandard aisle width and parking stall length
will make it somewhat more difficult to maneuver in and out of the parking stalls. In addition, users will not
be able to determine if there are any spaces available before entering the west lot and the dead-end aisle
lacks space for vehicles to turn around if the lot is full. Therefore, it is appropriate that these spaces be
reserved for staff use.
Likewise, it is recommended that the proposed parking lifts in the main lot be reserved for staff use since
these spaces will require cooperation among users parked above or below another vehicle. The high
proportion of compact spaces (29 of 36 spaces) may cause some staff to park off site. Rocketship should
investigate modifications to the site plan that would replace compact spaces with standard parking spaces.
The site plan shows bike racks located at the southeast corner of the building. The racks would provide
parking for 28 bikes, which equates to about six percent of the total students and staff at the school.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed
Rocketship Redwood Academy located at 860 Charter Street in Redwood City, California. The proposed project
consists of a 480-student charter school with 25 full-time staff and 5 to 10 part-time staff serving students in
grades K-5. The school would occupy an existing warehouse with 23,200 square feet that is currently used for
classic car sales. Primary access to the main parking lot used for student drop-off and pick-up would be provided
via two driveways, one each on Charter Street and Bay Road. During the peak hours immediately before and
after school, the driveway on Charter Street would be an inbound-only driveway, and the driveway on Bay Road
would be an outbound-only driveway. School staff will be positioned at each driveway to restrict traffic entering
and exiting these driveways to right turns only during these hours. During off-peak periods, the Charter Street
driveway would be fenced and the Bay Road driveway would serve both inbound and outbound traffic. The
school also would have a small parking lot accessible via a two-way driveway on Charter Street. The project site
location and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. The project site plan is shown on Figure 2.

Scope of Study
The purpose of this study is to identify any potentially significant traffic impacts and to identify transportation
improvements that may be necessary to support the proposed uses. The potential impacts of the development
were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the Redwood City, the County of San Mateo, and
the City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG). The C/CAG administers the San
Mateo County Congestion Management Program (CMP). The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM peak-
hour levels of service for nine intersections. The study intersections were selected to include locations where the
proposed project is expected to generate 10 or more peak-hour trips per lane.
The nine study intersections are listed below:
    1. Veterans Boulevard and Woodside Road (SR 84) [Redwood City/State]
    2. Broadway and Woodside Road (SR 84) [Redwood City/State]
    3. Bay Road and Woodside Road (SR 84) [Redwood City/State]
    4. Middlefield Road and Woodside Road (SR 84) [Redwood City/State] - CMP
    5. Bay Road and Charter Street (unsignalized) [County of San Mateo]
    6. Spring Street and Charter Street (unsignalized) [Redwood City/County of San Mateo]
    7. Bay Road and Kaynyne Street (unsignalized) [County of San Mateo]
    8. Spring Street and Kaynyne Street (unsignalized) [Redwood City/County of San Mateo]
    9. Bay Road and Douglas Avenue (unsignalized) [County of San Mateo]



                                                                                                     Page | 7
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                             September 28, 2016


The study intersections on Woodside Road (SR 84) are within the City limits but are owned and operated by
Caltrans. The study intersections on Bay Road are located within an unincorporated area controlled by the
County of San Mateo. The study intersections on Spring Street lie on the Redwood City boundary and are jointly
controlled by the City of Redwood City and the County of San Mateo.

Traffic conditions at the study locations were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The
Rocketship School would start classes at approximately 7:55 AM for all grades. Dismissal times would be
staggered by grade level with Kindergarten students dismissed at approximately 3:45 PM, 1st and 2nd grade
students dismissed at 4:00 PM and 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students dismissed at 4:10 PM. After school care would
be available on site until 6:30 PM. The peak hour of school traffic in the morning would coincide with the AM
peak hour of commute traffic (generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM). The peak hour of school traffic in the
afternoon would occur before the PM peak hour of commute traffic (typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM).
However, trips associated with after school programming would be added to the PM peak commute hour. It is
during these peak commute periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on an average weekday and
the impact on the roadway system by traffic from the school would be greatest.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
    Scenario 1: Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes at the intersections of Broadway and Woodside
                Road, Bay Road and Woodside Road, and Middlefield Road and Woodside Road were provided
                by the City. Existing intersection traffic volumes at the other three study intersections were
                obtained from new traffic counts conducted on October 21, 2014, and on January 27, 2015.

    Scenario 2: Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing
                volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed developments in the
                project area. Lists of approved but not yet completed developments were provided by the City of
                Redwood City and the County of San Mateo. Background conditions include the first phase of
                development at the Stanford in Redwood City project, which is assumed to comprise
                approximately 37 percent of the total project size at buildout.

    Scenario 3: Existing Plus Project Conditions. Projected peak-hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding
                to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the project. Trips generated by the
                existing land use on the project site were credited from the gross project generated traffic
                volumes. Existing Plus Project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in order
                to determine potential project impacts.

    Scenario 4: Background Plus Project Conditions. Projected peak-hour traffic volumes were estimated by
                adding to background traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the project. Background
                Plus Project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine
                potential project impacts.

    Scenario 5: Cumulative Conditions. The cumulative no project (or cumulative baseline) traffic volumes were
                estimated by applying a compound growth factor of one percent per year to existing traffic
                volumes and adding traffic from approved projects in the vicinity. The cumulative scenario
                assumes a horizon year of 2020 and full buildout of the Stanford in Redwood City project. The
                estimates of trips generated by the project were then added to the cumulative no project traffic
                volumes to yield cumulative plus project traffic volumes.

CMP Compliance
As the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for San Mateo County, the City/County Association of
Governments (C/CAG) is responsible for maintaining the performance and standards of the Congestion
Management Program (CMP) roadway network. The CMP requires new development projected to add 100 or
more peak-hour trips to the CMP roadway network to implement Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures
that would reduce project impacts. In the vicinity of the project site, facilities that are part of the CMP network
include US 101, Woodside Road (SR 84), and El Camino Real (SR 82).


                                                                                                    Page | 10

The proposed project would add more than 100 peak-hour trips to the CMP facilities in the vicinity of the project
site. Therefore, an analysis based on the requirements of C/CAG, the administering agency for the CMP, is
necessary.

Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described above. It
includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable level of service
standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, previous studies, field observations, trip
generation surveys, the City of Redwood City, and the County of San Mateo. The following data were collected
from these sources:

        existing intersection volumes
        existing lane geometries
        signal timing and phasing
        trip generation rates
        lists of approved but not yet completed projects

Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service is a
qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay,
to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are described below.

City of Redwood City Intersections
Intersections along Woodside Road (SR 84) are within the City of Redwood City boundaries. Consistent with
transportation impact analyses conducted for other recent developments in the City of Redwood City, including
the Stanford in Redwood City project, intersection operations were evaluated based on the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual methodology using the TRAFFIX software.

County of San Mateo Intersections
According to the County of San Mateo Traffic Impact Study Requirements (9/1/2013), all technical analysis of
transportation networks must use Synchro software and the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual.
Therefore, intersections that are controlled by the County of San Mateo were analyzed based on the 2010
Highway Capacity Manual methodology using the Synchro (Version 9) software.

Signalized Intersections
With the HCM methodology, signalized intersection levels of service are evaluated on the basis of average
control delay time (measured in seconds per vehicle) for all vehicles at the intersection. The correlation between
average delay and level of service for signalized intersections is shown in Table 1. The level of service
thresholds in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual are the same as that in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual.

Unsignalized Intersections
For stop-controlled intersections, level of service depends on the average delay experienced by vehicles that
must stop or yield to on-coming traffic. Thus, for two-way or T-intersections, operations are defined by the
average control delay experienced by vehicles entering the intersection from the stop-controlled approaches on
minor streets or from left-turn movements on major streets. For all-way stop controlled intersections, level of
service is determined by the average delay for all movements through the intersection. Table 2 summarizes the
relationship between LOS and average delay for unsignalized intersections. The level of service thresholds in the
2010 Highway Capacity Manual are the same as that in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual.


                                                                                                     Page | 11

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the
    A       green phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to          10.0 or less
            the very low vehicle delay.

            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle
    B       lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average           10.1 to 20.0
            vehicle delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
    C                                                                                               20.1 to 35.0
            of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the
            intersection without stopping.

            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
            result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
    D                                                                                               35.1 to 55.0
            lenghts, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
            individual cycle failures are noticeable.

            This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
    E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high                55.1 to 80.0
            volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
    F                                                                                             greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may
            also be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Level of Service Standards
For this analysis, the study intersections are located within the City of Redwood City and an unincorporated area of
San Mateo County. Level of service standards for each jurisdiction are described below.

City of Redwood City
The City of Redwood City General Plan contains the following transportation policy with respect to level of service:
        “Program BE-55 / Level of Service Policy Evaluation: Evaluate Redwood City’s current Level of Service
        (LOS) policies for motor vehicle circulation. The evaluation shall consider the following to ensure efficient
        traffic flow and balance multi‐modal mobility goals: Maintaining LOS D or better for motor vehicles in all
        areas of the city, except the Downtown area as defined by the Downtown Precise Plan. In Downtown, no
        minimum vehicular LOS standard will be maintained but vehicular LOS will be calculated and alternate
        LOS standards for other travel modes will be established.”
The study intersections are located outside the Downtown area; thus, the intersections are subject to the City’s
LOS D standard.

County of San Mateo
According to the County of San Mateo Traffic Impact Study Requirements (9/1/2013), the minimum LOS standard
for County intersections is typically LOS C or better; however, an LOS D standard may be allowed for peak periods
in very dense urban conditions per the County’s discretion. Because the study area is considered urban, a LOS D
standard applies.

Congestion Management Program
The study intersection of Middlefield Road and Woodside Road is a CMP intersection. The CMP level of service
standard for this intersection is LOS E or better. However, since the City of Redwood City has a more
conservative level of service standard (LOS D), this intersection was analyzed based on the more stringent City
of Redwood City standards.

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of the site,
including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project study area is provided by US 101 and I-280. These facilities are described below.
US 101 is a north-south freeway extending northward to San Francisco and southward through Gilroy. In the
vicinity of Redwood City, it is an eight-lane freeway facility. During the AM and PM commute times, one lane in
each direction is reserved for use by high occupancy vehicles. Access to the freeway from the project site is
provided via the Seaport Boulevard/Woodside Road interchange.
I-280 is a north-south freeway extending northward to San Francisco and southward to downtown San Jose. In
the vicinity of Redwood City, it is an eight-lane freeway facility. Access to the freeway from the project area is
provided via the Woodside Road interchange.
The following roadways provide local access to the site:
     Woodside Road is a four- to six-lane arterial that extends from US 101 to just west of I-280. Woodside Road
     is part of SR 84, which extends from San Gregorio to I-580 in Livermore. Woodside Road intersects
     Broadway and Bay Road in the vicinity of the project site.
     El Camino Real (SR 82) is a north-south, six-lane arterial that extends from south of Redwood City north
     into South San Francisco. El Camino Real intersects Woodside Road and Fifth Avenue in the vicinity of the
     project site.
     Middlefield Road is a two- to four-lane arterial that extends from south of San Antonio Avenue in Mountain
     View to its termination point in Downtown Redwood City. In the vicinity of the project site, Middlefield Road
     has four lanes and intersects Woodside Road and Charter Street.
     Veterans Boulevard is a two- to six-lane, east-west arterial that extends from its inception point north of
     Whipple Road at US 101, southeasterly to its termination point at Woodside Road.
     Broadway is a two- to four-lane roadway that extends from west of El Camino Real (SR 82) to its
     termination point at Fifth Avenue. In the vicinity of the project site, Broadway has four lanes and intersects
     Woodside Road and Charter Street.

     Bay Road is a two- to four-lane roadway that extends from Beech Street to beyond Marsh Road. In the
     vicinity of the project site, Bay Road is lined with industrial uses. Bay Road intersects Woodside Road,
     Willow Street, Charter Street, Kaynyne Street, and Douglas Avenue. Bay Road forms the northern project
     boundary and provides access from the project site via an outbound driveway.
     Spring Street is a two-lane roadway that extends east from Main Street to Florence Street. Through
     movement on Spring Street across Woodside Road is physically prohibited by the median on Woodside
     Road. Thus, movements on Spring Street are restricted to only right-in-right-outs. In the vicinity of the
     project site, industrial uses are found adjacent the north side of the street while residential uses lien the
     south side of the street. Spring Street intersects Woodside Road, Willow Street, Charter Street, Kaynyne
     Street/Flynn Avenue, and Douglas Avenue.
     Willow Street is a two-lane connector that connects Bay Road and Spring Street. The abutting properties on
     both sides of the street contain industrial uses.
     Charter Street is a two-lane street that extends from Middlefield Road northeasterly to beyond Broadway. It
     is lined with industrial uses from Spring Street to its northern terminus, and residential uses between Spring
     Street and Middlefield Road. Charter Street has all-way stops at Broadway and Bay Road. Charter Street
     forms the western project boundary, and provides direct access to the project site via an inbound only
     driveway to the main (east) lot and a full-access driveway to the west lot.
     Kaynyne Street/Flynn Avenue is a two-lane roadway that extends north from Middlefield Road to Bay Road.
     This street is named Kaynyne Street north of Spring Street and is lined with industrial uses. South of Spring
     Street it is lined with residential uses and is named Flynn Avenue.
     Douglas Avenue is a two-lane local roadway that extends from Middlefield Road northeasterly to beyond
     Broadway Street, where it terminates. Douglas Avenue is fronted by industrial uses north of Spring Street
     and residential uses south of Spring Street. It has all-way stop controlled intersections with Broadway
     Street and Bay Road.

Existing Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. Bike paths (Class I facilities) are pathways,
separate from roadways that are designated for use by bicycles. Often, these pathways also allow pedestrian
access. Bike lanes (Class II facilities) are lanes on roadways designated for use by bicycles with special lane
markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bike routes (Class III) are existing right-of-ways that accommodate
bicycles but are not separate from the existing travel lanes. Routes are typically designated only with signs.
Within the project vicinity, Class II bike lanes are provided on Broadway northbound between Charter Street and
Woodside Road, on both sides of Broadway between Woodside Road and Chestnut Street, and on both sides of
Middlefield Road between Woodside Road and Cassia Street. Class III bike routes are provided on Broadway
southbound between Woodside Road and Charter Street, on Charter Street between Broadway and Bay Road
west of Spring Street, and on Middlefield Road between Douglas Avenue and Woodside Road. Although they do
not include City-designated bicycle facilities, local roads like Spring Street, Douglas Street, and Kaynyne
Street/Flynn Avenue carry low traffic volumes and are conducive to bicyclists. The existing bicycle facilities within
the study area are shown on Figure 3.
Hexagon conducted bicycle counts at the intersections at Spring Street and Charter Street, and at Bay Road and
Douglas Avenue. During both the AM and PM peak periods, bicycle volumes at both intersections were relatively
low (less than 20 bicycles).
Existing bicycle counts are provided in Appendix A.

Existing Pedestrian Facilities
Roadways providing pedestrian access to the proposed project site include Spring Street, Charter Street, Bay
Road, and Douglas Avenue. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the street on all streets. Within the project
vicinity, the intersection at Spring Street and Charter Street provides pedestrian crosswalks across all legs. The
intersection at Bay Road and Charter Street provides crosswalks across all legs but the north leg. In addition, the
curb on the southeast corner of Bay and Charter features a bulb out, which reduces the crossing distance for
pedestrians attempting to cross Bay Road. The intersection at Bay Road and Douglas Avenue provides no
crosswalks. Bay Road also has uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks located just east of Kaynyne Street and just
west of Sweeney Avenue, and Spring Street has an uncontrolled mid-block crosswalk located just west of
Kaynyne Street.
Woodside Road provides sidewalks only on the north side. Among the four study intersections on Woodside
Road, only the intersections at Broadway and Woodside Road and at Bay Road and Woodside Road include
crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads. The intersections at Veterans Boulevard and Woodside Road and at
Middlefield Road and Woodside Road do not include crosswalks.
Hexagon conducted pedestrian counts on Bay Road at the intersections with Charter Street and Kaynyne Street,
on Spring Street at the intersections with Charter Street and Kaynyne Street, and at the intersection of Bay Road
and Douglas Avenue. During both the AM and PM peak periods, pedestrians at the intersection at Spring Street
and Charter Street were relatively high, with 80 and 73 pedestrians, respectively. This intersection is traversed
by elementary school children, as it is located near Hoover School. At all other intersections, pedestrian volumes
were consistently low, ranging between 5 and 25 pedestrians during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Existing pedestrian counts are provided in Appendix A.

Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) and
Caltrain. The transit services are described below and shown on Figure 4.

       The 276 line operates on Broadway and Bay Road within the project area, providing service between
        the Redwood City Transit Center and the intersection at Florence Street and 17th Avenue. The line
        operates only on weekdays, with one bus service every hour during the AM and PM peak commute
        periods. Within the project area, the 276 line stops at the intersection at Broadway and Charter Street.

       The 270 line operates on Broadway and Bay Road within the project area, providing service between
        the Redwood City Transit Center and the intersection at Florence Street and 17th Avenue. The line
        operates on weekdays with one bus service every hour during the AM and PM peak commute periods.
        Within the project area, the 270 line stops at the intersection at Broadway and Douglas Avenue.

       The 79 line operates on Middlefield Road within the project area, providing service from the intersection
        at Florence Street and 17th Avenue to Kennedy Middle School. The line operates only on school days,
        with three bus trips during the AM peak hour going to Kennedy Middle School, and three bus trips
        during the PM peak hour departing from Kennedy Middle School. Within the project area, the 79 line
        stops at the intersections at Middlefield Road and Flynn Avenue, and at Middlefield Road and Willow
        Street.

       The 296 line operates on Middlefield Road within the project area, providing service between the
        Redwood City Transit Center and the intersection at E. Bayshore Road and Donohoe Street. The line
        operates on weekdays with a 15- to 20-minute headway during the AM and PM peak commute periods.
        Within the project area, the 296 line stops at the intersection at Middlefield Road and Charter Street.

       The 297 line operates on Middlefield Road within the project area, providing service between the
        Redwood City Transit Center and the Palo Alto Transit Center. The line operates on weekdays with four
        buses in each direction. This line operates during the early mornings and late nights. This line provides
        no services during the AM and PM peak commute hours or mid-day period.


                                                                                                   Page | 17

        The 397 express line operates on Middlefield Road within the project area, providing service between
         downtown San Francisco and the Palo Alto Transit Center. The line operates on weekdays during the
         early mornings only. This line provides no services during the AM and PM peak commute hours or mid-
         day period.

        The RWC Mid-Point Caltrain Shuttle operates on Broadway within the project area, providing service
         between the Redwood City Center and the intersection at Broadway and Douglas Avenue. The shuttle
         operates on weekdays only, with 20- to 40-minute headways during the AM and PM peak commute
         periods. The RWC Mid-Point Caltrain Shuttle stops at the intersection of Broadway and Charter Street.
The nearest bus stop on Broadway is located less than one-quarter mile from the proposed school while the
nearest bus stop on Middlefield Road is located approximately ½ mile from the project site. Continuous
sidewalks are available for pedestrians walking between the school and the nearest bus stops. No improvements
to transit services are required.

Caltrain
Caltrain provides commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy. The project is located about 1.3
miles southeast of the Redwood City Caltrain station, which is located near the intersection of Winslow Street
and Broadway in downtown Redwood City. At the Redwood City station, Caltrain provides service with
approximately 20 to 30-minute headways during the weekday commute hours. The Redwood City Mid-Point
Caltrain Shuttle coincides with train arrivals and departures and provides shuttle service in and around the
project vicinity with a stop at the intersection of Charter Street and Broadway. The shuttle operates weekdays
between 6:30 to 9:30 AM and 3:45 to 6:45 PM with 20 to 30-minute headways.

Existing Lane Configurations and Traffic Volumes
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were obtained from field observations (see Figure 5).
Existing traffic volumes at the intersections of Broadway and Woodside Road, Bay Road and Woodside Road,
and Middlefield Road and Woodside Road were provided by the City. Existing traffic volumes at the other six
study intersections were obtained from counts conducted in October 2014, and in January 2015 (see Figure 6).

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 3. The
results show that the study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM
peak hours except the intersection at Woodside Road and Broadway, which is operating at LOS E during the AM
and PM peak hours. The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B and Appendix C.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm
the accuracy of calculated intersection levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing
traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the
level of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing traffic conditions.
During the AM peak period, Hexagon observed no significant intersection operational issues at the study
intersections. Hexagon observed minor congestion issues at the intersection at Bay Road and Woodside Road:

       Eastbound traffic on Woodside Road at Broadway consistently backs into the intersection at Bay Road.
        The eastbound queue clears the intersection with Bay Road, but not all vehicles can clear the
        intersection with Broadway within one signal cycle.

Notes:
1. Average intersection delay and LOS are reported for signalized and all-way stop controlled intersections.
2. Worst movement delay and LOS are reported for intersections controlled by San Mateo County.
BOLD indicates a substandard level of service


During the PM peak period, Hexagon observed several operational issues at the study intersections:

           Northbound traffic on Middlefield Road at the intersection with Woodside Road queued past Charter
            Street, and consistently required two cycles to clear.

           Northbound traffic on Broadway at the intersection with Woodside Road queued past Charter Street, and
            consistently required two cycles to clear.

           The eastbound left-turn movement on Woodside Road at the intersection with Veterans Boulevard is
            consistently full and occasionally overflows the turn pocket. Most queues clear within one cycle.

           Westbound Woodside Road at the intersection with Veterans Boulevard receives the green light before
            the intersection with Broadway. As a result, a temporary queue forms every cycle on westbound
            Woodside Road east of Veterans Boulevard. Not all westbound through traffic vehicles can clear the
            intersection with Broadway within one cycle.

           The westbound left-turn movement on Woodside Road at the intersection with Veterans Boulevard
            consistently overflows the turn pocket beyond an observable point from Veterans Boulevard. Not all
            vehicles were able to clear the intersection within one cycle.
Overall, the level of service analysis appears to reflect actual existing traffic conditions.

Background Conditions
This chapter describes background traffic conditions, which are defined as near-term conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed development. Included in this chapter are the procedures used to determine
background traffic volumes and a description of the resulting traffic conditions.

Background Traffic Volumes & Transportation Network
The transportation network under background conditions would be the same as the existing transportation
network except for the intersection at Woodside Road and Middlefield Road, which includes the changes in lane
configuration and signal phasing detailed in the Woodside Road and Middlefield Road Intersection
Improvements Project. The background lane configurations at the study intersections are shown on Figure 7.
Background conditions include projects under construction as well as projects that have been recently approved.
A list of approved developments was obtained from the City of Redwood City. The County of San Mateo also
was contacted but stated that there are no approved developments within unincorporated San Mateo County in
the vicinity of the project. Background conditions include the following projects in Redwood City:

       Kaiser Hospital (1150 Veterans Boulevard)
       The Palacio Apartments (439 Fuller Street)
       Crossing/900 (950 Middlefield Road)
       2411 Broadway Office Building (2411 Broadway)
       Indigo (525 Middlefield Road)
       333 Main Street Residential Development (333 Main Street)
       Radius (640 Veterans Boulevard)
       201 Marshall Residential Development (201 Marshall Street)
       145 Monroe (145 Monroe Street)
       Classics at Redwood City (735 Brewster Avenue)
       Lennar Multifamily West (601 Maple Street)
       Lathrop PARC Skilled Nursing Facility (134 Maple Street)
       24 Hour Fitness Center (1050 Broadway)
       Stanford University Phase I (405 Broadway)
       Costco Gas Station Expansion (2300 Middlefield Road)
       Fountain Square (2808 El Camino Real)
       The Abigail (1230 Hopkins Avenue)


                                                                                                  Page | 23

          University Art (2550 El Camino Real)
          Mel’s Bowl (2580 El Camino Real)

Because the Stanford University project would be built over a thirty-year period, background conditions include
only the first phase of development, which is assumed to comprise approximately 37% of the total project size at
buildout.

Trip generation estimates for the approved projects are shown in Table 4. Background traffic volumes were
estimated by adding to existing volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
developments in the project area. Traffic volumes under the background conditions are shown on Figure 8.

Background Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized in Table 5.
The results show that the following three study intersections would operate at unacceptable levels of service
during the AM and/or PM peak hours:

            Broadway & Woodside Road (#2) – AM and PM peak hours
            Middlefield Road & Woodside Road (#4) – PM peak hour
            Bay Road & Charter Street (#5) – PM peak hour (worst movement)
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B and Appendix C.

Project Conditions
This chapter describes traffic conditions with the project. First is a description of the significance criteria used to
establish what constitutes a project impact. A description of the transportation system under existing plus project
and background plus project conditions and the method by which project traffic is estimated is then described.
Included in this chapter is a summary of project traffic conditions, as well as any impacts caused by the project.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used to
determine impacts on intersections are based on the City of Redwood City and County of San Mateo level of
service standards.

City of Redwood City Definition of Significant Impact Criteria
According to common Redwood City practice, traffic impacts at a study intersection would be considered
significant if the project or project plus cumulative development would cause:
Signalized Intersection
    1. Operations at a signalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an
       unacceptable level (LOS E or F); or
    2. Average delay at a signalized intersection operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) to increase by
       five seconds or more.
Unsignalized Intersection
    1. Operations at an unsignalized intersection to deteriorate from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) to an
       unacceptable level (LOS E or F); or
    2. Delay at an unsignalized intersection operating at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) to increase by five
       seconds or more; and traffic volumes at the intersection satisfy the Caltrans peak-hour volume signal
       warrant for traffic signal installation.

County of San Mateo
According to the County of San Mateo Traffic Impact Study Requirements (9/1/2013), a project is considered to
have a significant impact if, for either peak hour, either of the following conditions occurs:
    1. For intersections currently in compliance with the level of service standard, a project will cause the
       intersection to operate at a level of service that violates the overall standard of LOS C with no individual


                                                                                                       Page | 28
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                              September 28, 2016


        movement operating at worse than LOS D. On occasion, LOS D may be allowed for peak periods in very
        dense urban conditions at the County’s discretion.
    2. For intersections currently NOT in compliance with the level of service standard, a project will cause the
       intersection to operate at a level of service that violates the standard LOS mentioned above and the
       proposed project increases average control delay and individual movements at the intersection by four
       seconds or more.

As noted above, minimum LOS standards for County intersections are typically LOS C or better; however, an
LOS D standard may be allowed for peak periods in very dense urban conditions per the County’s discretion.
Because the study area is considered urban, a LOS D standard applies to intersections as a whole and to
individual movements.

Transportation Network Under Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions, including
roadways and intersection lane configurations, would be the same as that described under existing conditions.
The transportation network under background plus project conditions, including roadways and intersection lane
configurations, would be the same as that described under background conditions.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would appear are
estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In
determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is estimated for the AM
and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of the directions to and from
which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project trips are assigned to specific
streets and intersections. These procedures are described below.

Trip Generation
The trip generation rates for the school were based on surveys that Hexagon Transportation Consultants
conducted at five Rocketship schools between 2012 and 2014. The observed trip generation rates are presented
in Table 6. The trip generation rates at Rocketship schools in San Jose are significantly higher than the
elementary school trip rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition. The magnitude of traffic generated by the proposed school was estimated by multiplying the observed
Rocketship school trip generation rates by the proposed enrollment at the Rocketship Redwood Academy (480
students).
The Rocketship Redwood Academy will implement a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program that
will encourage students and employees to carpool, take transit, or use active modes of transport to get to and
from school. Table 7 lists the TDM measures proposed by Rocketship as well as additional TDM measures that
may be implemented to reduce further the vehicle trips generated by the project. The TDM program is expected
to reduce the vehicle trips and parking demand generated by the Rocketship Redwood Academy compared to
that observed at other Rocketship schools in San Jose, which do not have similar TDM programs. To be
conservative, this report assumes no trip reductions for TDM measures. According to C/CAG guidelines, the
project is required to reduce the demand for all new peak hour trips generated by the school. However, many of
the TDM measures listed in the C/CAG guidelines are not applicable to an elementary school site. Thus, it is
infeasible to mitigate every peak-hour trip generated by the project. It should be noted that while the trips
generated by the proposed school would be new to the roadways immediately adjacent to the project site, in a
regional context, the Rocketship school trips are merely reassigned trips from other schools in the area where
the students would have otherwise attended.

The traffic generated by the school would comprise trips by staff, visitors, non-working parents, and working
parents. There will be approximately 25 full-time staff members at the site. Hexagon estimates that 60% of
parents will drop off students on the way to work, while the remaining 40% of parents will drop off students and
return home.
The trip generation estimates are presented in Table 8. Based on the surveyed trip generation rates, and
crediting the existing use on-site, the project is expected to generate a net 462 trips (250 inbound and 212
outbound) during the AM peak hour and 247 trips (101 inbound and 146 outbound) during the PM peak hour.

Trip Distribution
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed project was estimated based on existing travel patterns on the
surrounding roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. Four separate trip distributions were
used in this study: (1) staff and visitors, (2) non-working parents, (3) incoming trips for working parents, (4)
outgoing trips for working parents. The trip distribution patterns are illustrated on Figures 9 to 11.




                                                                                                                                                        Page | 32

Trip Assignment
The peak-hour trips generated by the proposed development were assigned to the roadway system in
accordance with the trip distribution patterns discussed above. The assignment reflects the proposed right-turn
only restrictions at the school inbound and outbound driveways on Charter Street and Bay Road, respectively
during the peak hours before and after school. The turn restrictions at the school driveways and the turn
restrictions at the Woodside/Spring intersection will affect the paths that vehicles use when approaching and
departing the school. For vehicles approaching from the east on Woodside Road, it is expected that vehicles will
turn left onto southbound Bay Road, right onto westbound Willow Street, left onto southbound Spring Street, and
then left onto eastbound Charter Street. For vehicles prevented from turning left out of the site onto northbound
Bay Road, there are two alternate paths available. It is expected that many vehicles that want to head east on
Woodside Road will turn right onto westbound Kaynyne Street, turn right onto northbound Spring Street, then
right onto eastbound Woodside Road. The traffic assignment assumes that half of all traffic destined for
eastbound Woodside Road would use this path. The other half would turn left onto eastbound Douglas Avenue,
left onto northbound Broadway, then right onto eastbound Woodside Road. It is expected that all vehicles that
want to head west on Woodside Road will turn right onto westbound Kaynyne Street, right onto Middlefield Road,
then left onto westbound Woodside Road. The net project trips at study intersections are shown on Figure 12.

Project Condition Traffic Volumes
Project impacts were evaluated relative to both (1) existing traffic volumes and (2) background traffic volumes.
For the existing plus project scenario, projected peak-hour traffic volumes with the project were estimated by
adding the net new trips generated by the proposed project to existing traffic volumes. For the background plus
project scenario, projected peak-hour traffic volumes with the project were estimated by adding the net new trips
generated by the proposed project to background traffic volumes. The project condition traffic volumes at the
study intersections for each scenario are shown in Figures 13 and 14.

The results of the level of service calculations show that under existing plus project conditions, all study
intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of service except at the intersection at Broadway
and Woodside Road, which would continue to operate at LOS E during the AM and PM peak hours with the
project. The added project trips would not have a significant impact at this intersection based on the City’s
significant impact criteria.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the school project site at
860 Charter Street, including:

       Potential impacts to pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities
       Site access and on-site circulation
       Parking demand
       Neighborhood traffic conditions

Potential Impacts to Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit Facilities
As shown in Figure 9, residential areas within walking distance of the site are primarily located west of
Spring Street. Very few pedestrians are expected to arrive and depart from the area east of Bay Road since
the area is primarily industrial and the nearest neighborhood east of Bay Road is more than three quarters
of a mile to the south. Pedestrian facilities in the study area consist of sidewalks located on both sides of
Charter Street and Bay Road in the vicinity of the project. The intersection at Bay Road and Charter Street
provides crosswalks on all but the north leg. A crosswalk on the north leg is unnecessary since pedestrians
walking to and from school may cross Bay Road using the crosswalk on the south leg, which is immediately
adjacent to the school. In addition, the curb on the southeast corner features a bulb out, which reduces the
crossing distance for pedestrians crossing Bay Road. The project proposes to add a similar bulb out on the
southwest corner, which would further enhance pedestrian movements at the intersection. The design of
the roadway geometry is subject to San Mateo County standards and approval. The intersection at Spring
Street and Charter Street provides crosswalks on all legs. Bay Road also has uncontrolled mid-block
crosswalks located just south of Kaynyne Street and just north of Sweeney Avenue, and Spring Street has
an uncontrolled mid-block crosswalk located just north of Kaynyne Street. It is recommended that students
that need to cross Bay Road or Spring Street be encouraged to cross using crosswalks at an all-way stop-
controlled intersection rather than at an uncontrolled midblock crosswalk. Crosswalks with ADA-compliant
curb ramps should be provided at the following locations to enhance the major student walking routes to
school:

       West Willow Street approach to Bay Road
       West Sweeney Avenue approach to Bay Road
       All approaches at the Bay Road/Douglas Avenue intersection (all-way stop controlled)
       West Scott Avenue approach to Spring Street
       All approaches at the Spring Street/Douglas Avenue intersection (all-way stop controlled)




                                                                                              Page | 42
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                         September 28, 2016


No bicycle lanes are provided in the immediate vicinity of the project site. Charter Street is designated as a
Class III bike route between Broadway and Bay Road and between Spring Street and Middlefield Road. It is
recommended that sharrows be added to the segment of Charter Street between Spring Street and Bay
Road, a segment that is within unincorporated San Mateo County, to complete the bike route. Although they
do not include City-designated bicycle facilities, local roads like Spring Street, Douglas Street, and Kaynyne
Street/Flynn Avenue carry low traffic volumes and are conducive to bicyclists. The Redwood City General
Plan identifies Bay Road, Broadway, and Second and Fifth Avenues as locations where the community has
expressed a desire for future bike routes. However, these improvements are not yet planned, as further
study is needed to assess the feasibility of routes, safety, and adequate rights-of‐way. Implementation of
bike facilities on Bay Road or Broadway is beyond the scope of this project. Likewise, bicycle improvements
on Second or Fifth Avenue are not warranted by this project since the number of bicycle trips on these
streets generated by the proposed Rocketship school would be quite small given their distance from the
project site.
Transit in the study area is provided by SamTrans. The study area is served by five bus routes and a
Caltrain shuttle. The nearest bus stop on Broadway is located less than one-quarter mile from the proposed
school while the nearest bus stop on Middlefield Road is located approximately ½ mile from the project site.
Continuous sidewalks are available for pedestrians walking between the school and the nearest bus stops.
Because the proposed Rocketship School would serve students in grades K through 5, transit usage is
expected to be minimal since students would need to be accompanied by an adult. Even if the TDM
program is successful in encouraging a high percentage of staff to use transit, the number staff transit riders
is likely to be four or fewer. The limited transit usage attributable to this project does not warrant
improvements to the existing services.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
This section describes the site access, circulation, and parking for the proposed project. This review is
based on the project site plan labeled “Rocketship Redwood Academy” provide by K2A Architecture +
Interiors dated September 25, 2015.

Site Access
The site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site’s driveways with regard to the
following: traffic volume, delays, vehicle queues, geometric design, corner sight distance, and truck access.
The site plan shows that student drop off and pick up would occur in the main school parking lot located
along the eastern edge of the property. This lot would be served by two driveways, one each on Charter
Street and Bay Road. Both driveways would be 24 feet wide, which meets the minimum driveway width set
forth in the City’s zoning code. During the peak pick-up/drop-off hours, the driveway on Charter Street
would function as an inbound-only driveway, while the driveway on Bay Road would serve as outbound-
only. School staff will be positioned at each driveway to restrict traffic entering and exiting these driveways
to right turns only during these hours. During off-peak periods, the Charter Street driveway would be fenced
and the Bay Road driveway would serve both inbound and outbound traffic.
The proposed Charter Street driveway would be approximately 16 feet west of the crosswalk at Bay Road.
The driveway location complies with City guidelines, which require a minimum of 15 feet between a curb cut
and a crosswalk.
The proposed Bay Road driveway would be approximately 90 feet south of the crosswalk at Charter Street,
which meets the City’s guidelines. Field observations indicate that southbound Bay Road traffic is relatively
low volume with adequate gaps in traffic created by the all-way stop control at the Bay/Charter intersection.
Right turns out of the outbound driveway onto Bay Road are expected to experience minimal delays.
The site plan shows that the project would provide a small parking lot along the western edge of the project
site. Access to this parking lot would be provided by a two-way full-access driveway on Charter Street at the
northern end of the parking lot. Adjacent to the parking spaces, the drive aisle would be 20 feet wide.
Between the trash enclosure and Charter Street, the driveway would be 28 feet wide and would provide an


                                                                                               Page | 43
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                          September 28, 2016


unobstructed approach for collection vehicles. This driveway also provides access to a small parking area
associated with an adjacent property. Field observations have indicated that Charter Street between Spring
Street and Bay Road carries relatively low traffic volume. Vehicles accessing this parking lot would
experience minimal delays.

Sight Distance
The outbound driveway on Bay Road should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight
distance, thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other vehicles
travelling on adjacent streets. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a driver’s ability to locate a
gap in traffic and see oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists.
Sight distance generally should be provided in accordance with Caltrans standards. The minimum
acceptable sight distance is often considered the Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance
requirements vary depending on the roadway speeds. The proposed project would require the posted
speed limit on Bay Road to be reduced from 30 to 25 mph (miles per hour) when school children are
present. The associated Caltrans stopping distance is 200 feet. Thus, a driver must be able to see 200 feet
to the north on southbound Bay Road to locate sufficient gaps to turn right. There are no roadway curves or
landscaping features shown on the site plan that would obstruct the vision of exiting drivers. It is
recommended that the current prohibition of on-street parking along the project frontage on Bay Road be
maintained to ensure adequate sight distance at the outbound project driveway.
The existing speed limit on Charter Street is 25 mph. Thus, a driver must be able to see 200 feet down
Charter Street to locate a sufficient gap to turn out of the staff parking lot driveway. There are no roadway
curves or landscaping features shown on the site plan that would obstruct the vision of exiting drivers. On-
street parking is allowed along eastbound Charter Street immediately east of the driveway location. West of
the driveway, on-street parking is prohibited for a distance of 12 feet due to a fire hydrant. In order to
provide a stopping distance of 200 feet, on-street parking would need to be prohibited for a distance of 50
feet west of the driveway and 25 feet east of the driveway. The loss of on-street parking at this location
would affect adjacent businesses. Since this driveway is recommended for use only by staff and not by
parents dropping off or picking up students, the traffic volume using this driveway is expected to be similar
to existing conditions. While the existing on-street parking would hinder visibility of approaching vehicles on
Charter Street, vehicles exiting this driveway will have clear view of students approaching on the sidewalk
from either direction. It is recommended that the applicant work with the County to prohibit on-street parking
on both sides of the driveway to provide the required sight distance to remedy the existing deficiency.
Removal of on-street parking would require the approval of a majority of property owners in the vicinity.

Site Circulation
The drop-off/pick-up area (main parking lot) would have one-way circulation during the peak periods before
and after school with two travel lanes for the entire distance from the inbound driveway on Charter Street to
the outbound driveway on Bay Road. During off-peak periods, the portion of the main lot nearest Charter
Street would be fenced off for use as a student recreation area and the Bay Road driveway would serve
both inbound and outbound trips. The site plan shows a total of 28 90-degree parking spaces (2 van
accessible spaces, 5 standard spaces, 1 compact space, and 20 double stacked parking lift spaces) located
in the southern portion of the lot near the Bay Road driveway. The parking lifts would be immediately
adjacent to the proposed fence that borders the play area. It is recommended that a buffer be provided
between the fence and the end parking lift spaces in order to facilitate maneuvers to and from these
spaces. During the peak drop-off and pick-up times, on-site queuing will prevent vehicles from entering or
exiting the parking spaces in the main lot. During these brief periods, parents wishing to park would need to
use off-site parking facilities such as on-street parking on Charter Street. Most school staff are expected to
arrive and depart before or after the peak student drop-off and pick-up periods. The parking lot along the
western edge of the project site would provide eight compact parking spaces along the eastern edge of the
parking lot. Vehicles in this lot would utilize a single driveway on Charter Street to enter and exit the lot.




                                                                                                Page | 44

Access and Circulation for Emergency Vehicles and Trucks
Site access was evaluated with vehicle turning movement templates to determine the adequacy of the site
plan for truck and emergency vehicle access. SU-30 trucks, representing medium-size emergency vehicles
and delivery trucks would be able to access, circulate, and exit both the staff parking lot and the main
loading area without encroaching opposing lanes. The trash area is located at the northeast corner of the
west parking lot. Garbage trucks (modeled with SU-30 trucks) would be able to access the trash area. WB-
40 trucks, representing the large fire trucks and semi-trailer trucks, would be able to access both the staff
parking lot and the main loading area, but they would encroach onto the opposing lane. The number of
large fire trucks and semi-trailer trucks is expected to be at a minimal, so encroaching the opposing lane is
not expected to adversely affect traffic conditions.
Because the west parking lot is a dead-end at the southern end, all large vehicles entering the lot would
require backing out of the driveway. Ideally, it is desirable to provide a turn-around on site so that trucks and
emergency vehicles do not have to back out onto the street to exit the site. However, there is insufficient
space to provide a turnaround between the building and the property line on the western edge of the site.
Furthermore, the existing building extends almost the entire distance between the southern and northern
property lines making is impossible to connect the staff parking lot with the main parking lot without
demolishing a portion of the building. Therefore, it is not feasible to provide a turnaround area on site. To
reduce the potential hazards associated with trucks and emergency vehicles backing out of the staff lot, it is
recommended that the applicant work with the County to prohibit on-street parking on both sides of the
driveway to improve the sight distance at this location. Emergency vehicles accessing the main parking lot
would need to pass through the gated student recreation portion of the lot to circulate in one driveway and
out the other in order to avoid having to back out onto the street to exit the site.

Drop-off and Pick-up
The site plan proposes two continuous lanes throughout the main parking lot. During the peak periods
immediately before and after school, vehicles will enter the site via a right turn only from Charter Street and
proceed to the next available queuing lane, A or B as noted on the site plan (A being the westernmost lane).
Vehicles will traverse a serpentine double lane queue and exit the site via a right turn onto Bay Road. No
student activity will be permitted in the outdoor play area during drop off and pick up times. All students will
remain in the cafeteria. As occurs at every other Rocketship School in San Jose, student loading and
unloading will occur from both lanes with assistance from support staff. The loading zone will begin on the
south side of the crosswalk and extend for a distance of approximately 110 feet in lane A and 92 feet in lane
B. Staff will be positioned at the crosswalk to ensure pedestrian safety and to direct vehicle traffic. Vehicles
will be directed to proceed into the designated loading area in groups (5 vehicles in lane A and 4 vehicles in
lane B) when the previous vehicles have cleared the loading zone. Support staff will then escort children
between their vehicles and the designated walking path that leads to the cafeteria. The total loading area
provided would be 202 feet. On-site queuing space upstream of the loading zone measures 134 feet in lane
A and 124 feet in lane B. Downstream of the loading zone there is a total of 88 feet (46 feet in lane A and
42 feet in lane B) for exiting vehicles to queue on site after loading/unloading before turning right onto Bay
Road. The waiting area will enable student loading/unloading operations to continue even while vehicles
that have previously unloaded wait to for a sufficient gap in traffic to exit the site.
During peak drop-off/pick-up periods, Rocketship staff will monitor the inbound and outbound driveways,
and on-site loading area to ensure that vehicles do not turn left into and out of the school and obey safe
loading practices. Therefore, any vehicle queues that may develop outside the project site would be limited
to eastbound Charter Street.
School drop-off and pick-up operations and resulting queues were observed at Rocketship Mateo Sheedy
Elementary on November 27, 2012, and Rocketship Si Se Puede Academy on December 4, 2012. The
length of vehicle queues at the project site was estimated based on our observations at these existing
Rocketship schools. The estimates take into account the projected enrollment (480 students) and the length
of the student loading zone (202 feet total). It is estimated that 450 feet of queuing space would be needed
for drop-off operations and 400 feet of queue storage would be needed for pick-up operations. Including the
loading zone and queue storage space on site, available queue storage space would total 460 feet. Thus,


                                                                                                Page | 45
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                          September 28, 2016


during the peak period before and after school, drop-off and pick-up queues will be contained within the
project site and will not extend on to Charter Street.
The proposed TDM Program is expected to reduce the vehicle trips and parking demand generated by the
Rocketship Redwood Academy thereby reducing the length of queue storage needed for drop-off and pick-
up operations. The analysis of queue lengths presented in this report is conservative in that it does not
assume any trip reductions for TDM. With a successful implementation of the proposed carpooling and off-
site parking programs, vehicle queues will further reduced within the school site.

Parking Supply and Dimensions
The site plan proposes a total of 36 on-site parking spaces, including 20 spaces in double stacked parking
lifts, 5 standard spaces, 1 compact space and 2 van-accessible spaces in the main (east) parking lot, and 8
compact spaces in the west parking lot. The project site is located partially within unincorporated San Mateo
County, and partially within the City of Redwood City. The zoning regulations at both jurisdictions state that
elementary schools are required to provide 1 parking space per classroom and 1 per 100 s.f. of assembly
area. Based on this standard, the project would be required to provide 34 on-site parking spaces. The
proposed parking supply (36 spaces) fulfills the zoning code requirements and is 11 spaces more than the
projected full-time school employment.
Furthermore, the school’s TDM Program is expected to encourage school staff to carpool or use alternative
modes of transportation such that not all employees will need a parking space. Thus, there will be parking
available on site for part-time staff that arrive later in the morning, as well as parents volunteering at the
school. In addition, on-street parking is permitted on Charter Street adjacent the school site.
The existing parking area along the western edge of the site is fully occupied at times. The applicant reports
that vehicles that currently park in this location are generated by adjacent businesses (Luxury European,
850 Charter Street and Rebuilding Together Peninsula, 841 Kaynyne Street) and park there out of
convenience. The project is under no legal obligation to provide parking for any other business. Upon
construction of the proposed school, all vehicles associated with off-site uses would need to find parking
elsewhere.
The dimensions of the standard parking spaces (8.5 feet wide by 18-19 feet long including a 2-foot
overhang) meet the standards expressed in the City’s zoning code.
According to the 2013 California Building Code (CBC), the site is required to have two accessible parking
spaces, of which at least one must be a van accessible space. The proposed two van accessible spaces
would be 9 feet wide and 18 feet long, which meets the CBC requirements for the required number of
spaces and space dimensions. An 8-foot wide access aisle is shown adjacent to the passenger side of each
space, which complies with CBC requirements.
The parking lift spaces in the main lot are approximately 8 feet wide and 18 feet long (including a 2 foot
overhang at the front of the vehicle). These lift spaces meets the City’s minimum standard for length,
however, the width falls short of the City’s minimum for standard parking spaces (8.5 feet). The parking
spaces in the west lot meet the City’s minimum standard for width (8.5 feet) but are only 17 feet long, which
is one foot short of the minimum length for standard spaces. Thus, these spaces are labeled as compact
spaces. The aisle width in the main parking lot (24 feet) equals the City’s minimum standard. However, in
the west parking lot, the aisle would be only 20 feet in width, which falls short of the City’s requirement. The
substandard aisle width and parking stall length will make it somewhat more difficult to maneuver in and out
of the parking stalls. In addition, users will not be able to determine if there are any spaces available before
entering the west lot and the dead-end aisle lacks space for vehicles to turn around if the lot is full.
Therefore, it is appropriate that these spaces be reserved for staff use.
Likewise, it is recommended that the proposed parking lifts in the main lot be reserved for staff use since
these spaces will require cooperation among users parked above or below another vehicle. The high
proportion of compact parking spaces (29 of 36 spaces) may cause some staff with full-sized vehicles to

park off site. Rocketship should investigate modifications to the site plan that would replace compact
spaces with standard parking spaces.
The site plan shows bike racks located at the southeast corner of the building. The racks provide parking for
28 bikes, which equates to about six percent of the total students and staff at the school.

Neighborhood Traffic Conditions
Existing and estimated future daily traffic volumes on three neighborhood streets are presented based on
the tube count data and trip estimates for the proposed Rocketship school as well as other approved
projects in the vicinity. Since the City has not established any policies or thresholds regarding neighborhood
streets, the information is presented for information only. Table 11 presents the traffic volume data for
neighborhood streets in the vicinity of the project.

Cumulative Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under cumulative conditions both
with and without the proposed project.

Roadway Network and Traffic Volumes
The transportation network under cumulative conditions includes the improvements described in the
Mitigation Monitoring Checklist – Stanford in Redwood City Precise Plan. For the four signalized study
intersections on Woodside Road, modifications to the intersections include changes in lane configuration
and signal phasing. For the all-way stop-controlled intersections at Bay Road and Charter Street and at Bay
Road and Douglas Avenue, a traffic signal with protected phasing on Bay Road is identified in the Stanford
Mitigation Monitoring Checklist. No improvements are assumed at the remaining three unsignalized study
intersections. The cumulative lane configurations at the study intersections are shown on Figure 15
The cumulative scenarios assume a horizon year of 2020. While the Stanford in Redwood City may not be
completely built and occupied by that year, it is anticipated that the required mitigation measures would be
in place by the year 2020. Cumulative no project (or cumulative baseline) traffic volumes were estimated by
first applying a one percent growth factor per year until 2020 to the existing (2014) traffic volumes. With
compounding, this yields a factor of 1.062. The growth rate and horizon year were determined by the City of
Redwood City. The trips generated by approved projects in the vicinity were then added to obtain
cumulative no project traffic volumes. Cumulative conditions reflect the trips generated by the Stanford
University project at full buildout.
The cumulative no project traffic volumes are shown on Figure 16. The net project trip estimates were then
added to the cumulative no project traffic volumes to yield cumulative plus project traffic volumes. The
intersection turning-movement volumes under cumulative plus project conditions are depicted on Figure 17.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Cumulative Conditions
The level of service results for the study intersections under all cumulative scenarios are summarized in
Table 12. Under cumulative no project conditions, the following study intersections are expected to operate
at unacceptable levels of service during the AM and/or PM peak hours:

             Broadway & Woodside Road (#2) – AM and PM peak hours
             Middlefield Road & Woodside Road (#4) – AM and PM peak hours
             Bay Road & Charter Street (#5) – AM and PM peak hours (worst movement)
             Bay Road & Douglas Avenue (#9) – PM peak hour (worst movement)

Conclusions
The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the City of
Redwood City, the County of San Mateo, and the City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo
County (C/CAG). The C/CAG administers the San Mateo County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The traffic analysis is based on the AM and PM peak-hour levels of service for nine intersections. The traffic
analysis also included an evaluation of potential impacts to bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities and a
review of site access, on-site circulation, drop-off and pick-up operations, and parking.

Project Trip Generation Estimates
The trip generation rates for the school were based on surveys conducted at five Rocketship schools in San
Jose. Based on the observed trip generation rates, and crediting the trips generated by existing use on-site,
the project is expected to generate a net 462 trips (250 inbound and 212 outbound) during the AM peak
hour and 247 trips (101 inbound and 146 outbound) during the PM peak hour.
The Rocketship Redwood Academy will implement a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program
that will encourage students and employees to carpool, take transit, or use active modes of transport to get
to and from school. The TDM program is expected to reduce the vehicle trips and parking demand
generated by the Rocketship Redwood Academy compared to that observed at other Rocketship schools in
San Jose, which do not have similar TDM programs. However, to be conservative, this report assumes no
trip reductions for TDM measures.

Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the level of service calculations show that several study intersections would operate at
unacceptable levels of service. Based on the significance criteria established by the City of Redwood City
and the County of San Mateo, the proposed project is not expected to cause a significant impact at any of
the study intersections. Therefore, no mitigation is required.

Potential Impacts to Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit Facilities
The project proposes to add a bulb out on the southwest corner of the Bay/Charter intersection, which
would enhance pedestrian movements at the intersection. The design of the roadway geometry is subject to
San Mateo County standards and approval. Crosswalks with ADA-compliant curb ramps should be provided
at the following locations to enhance the major student walking routes to school:

       West Willow Street approach to Bay Road
       West Sweeney Avenue approach to Bay Road

                                                                                              Page | 53
Rocketship Redwood Academy – Traffic Study Report                                         September 28, 2016


       All approaches at the Bay Road/Douglas Avenue intersection (all-way stop controlled)
       West Scott Avenue approach to Spring Street
       All approaches at the Spring Street/Douglas Avenue intersection (all-way stop controlled)

It is recommended that sharrows be added to the segment of Charter Street between Spring Street and Bay
Road, a segment that is within unincorporated San Mateo County, to form a continuous bike route between
Middlefield Road and Broadway.
The study area is served by five bus routes and a Caltrain shuttle. The nearest bus stop on Broadway is
located less than one-quarter mile from the proposed school while the nearest bus stop on Middlefield Road
is located approximately ½ mile from the project site. Continuous sidewalks are available for pedestrians
walking between the school and the nearest bus stops. The limited transit usage attributable to this project
does not warrant improvements to the existing services.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
The following modifications are recommended to improve site access and on-site circulation:

       The current prohibition of on-street parking along the project frontage on Bay Road should be
        maintained to ensure adequate sight distance at the outbound project driveway.
       The applicant should work with the County of San Mateo to prohibit on-street parking on both sides
        of the staff parking lot driveway on Charter Street to remedy the existing sight distance deficiency.
        Removal of on-street parking requires the approval of a majority of property owners in the vicinity.
       A buffer should be provided between the fence that borders the play area and the end parking lift
        spaces in order to facilitate maneuvers to and from these spaces.

Drop-off and Pick-up
The site plan proposes two continuous lanes throughout the main parking lot. During the peak periods
immediately before and after school, vehicles will enter the site via a right turn only from Charter Street and
proceed to the next available queuing lane. Vehicles will traverse a serpentine double lane queue and exit
the site via a right turn onto Bay Road. Student loading and unloading will occur from both lanes with
assistance from support staff. Vehicles will be directed to proceed into the designated loading area in
groups when the previous vehicles have cleared the loading zone. Support staff will then escort children
between their vehicles and the designated walking path that leads to the cafeteria. During peak drop-
off/pick-up periods, Rocketship staff will monitor the inbound and outbound driveways, and on-site loading
area to ensure that vehicles obey safe loading practices and do not turn left into and out of the school.
Based on observations of drop-off and pick-up operations at other Rocketship schools in San Jose, drop-off
and pick-up queues are expected to be contained within the project site and will not extend on to Charter
Street.

Parking Supply and Dimensions
The site plan proposes a total of 36 on-site parking spaces. The project site is located partially within
unincorporated San Mateo County, and partially within the City of Redwood City. The proposed parking
supply fulfills the zoning code requirements of both the City and the County and is 11 spaces more than the
projected full-time school employment.
Furthermore, the school’s TDM Program is expected to encourage school staff to carpool or use alternative
modes of transportation such that not all employees will need a parking space. Thus, there will be parking
available on site for part-time staff that arrive later in the morning, as well as parents volunteering at the
school. In addition, on-street parking is permitted on Charter Street adjacent the school site.




                                                                                               Page | 54

The existing parking area along the western edge of the site is fully occupied at times. The applicant
reports that vehicles that currently park in this location are generated by adjacent businesses (Luxury
European, 850 Charter Street and Rebuilding Together Peninsula, 841 Kaynyne Street) and park there out
of convenience. The project is under no legal obligation to provide parking for any other business. Upon
construction of the proposed school, all vehicles associated with off-site uses would need to find parking
elsewhere.
The dimensions of the standard parking spaces meet the standards expressed in the City’s zoning code.
The proposed two van accessible spaces meet the 2013 California Building Code (CBC) requirements for
the required number of spaces and space dimensions. An access aisle is shown adjacent to the passenger
side of each space in compliance with CBC standards.
While the length of the parking lift spaces in the main lot meets the City’s requirement, the width of the
spaces falls short of the minimum for standard spaces. Thus, the lift spaces are best used by compact
vehicles. The parking spaces in the west lot are also designated as compact spaces.
The aisle width in the main parking lot meets the City’s minimum standard. However, in the west parking lot
the aisle falls short of the City’s requirement. The substandard aisle width and parking stall length will make
it somewhat more difficult to maneuver in and out of the parking stalls. In addition, users will not be able to
determine if there are any spaces available before entering the west lot, and the dead-end aisle lacks space
for vehicles to turn around if the lot is full. Therefore, it is appropriate that these spaces be reserved for staff
use.
Likewise, it is recommended that the proposed parking lifts in the main lot be reserved for staff use since
these spaces will require cooperation among users parked above or below another vehicle. The high
proportion of compact parking spaces (29 of 36 spaces) may cause some staff with full-sized vehicles to
park off site. Rocketship should investigate modifications to the site plan that would replace compact
