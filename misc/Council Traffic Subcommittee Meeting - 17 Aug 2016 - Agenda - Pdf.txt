TO:          Mayor & Council
FROM:        Mitch Wasserman
DATE:        August 4, 2016
RE:          STUDY SESSION – CUT THROUGH TRAFFIC POLICY
BACKGROUND:
One of the advantages of living in Clyde Hill is its location and proximity…the easy
distance to Bellevue and Seattle makes just about everything readily available.
However, this advantage can also be a problem. The same people going to and from
Bellevue/Seattle use Clyde Hill streets, especially on Monday-Friday at PM peak times
(4pm to 7pm). The lure and associated problems are centered on the 84 th interchange to
SR 520.

This is not a new issue. For years the City and its neighbors have complained about
and have attempted to make adjustments to city streets in an effort to manage evening
cut through traffic. In the 1980’s Clyde Hill developed a Transportation Committee to
discuss traffic concerns. In 1998 Clyde Hill, Hunts Point Yarrow Point and Medina hired
a traffic engineer to study the issue. The consensus at that time was to pursue the idea
of restricting access to SR-520 from 84th Avenue in the PM peak periods of the day.
The hope was that this would eliminate the lure for any cut-through traffic to go through
our communities.

Over the last few decades Clyde Hill has invested in a number of projects to address
speeding and cut through traffic. Various traffic calming methods have been used:
speed humps on 98th, safety intersection improvements on 24th, flashing stop signs,
directed patrolling, defined intersections and reduced lane width on 24th, boulevard
w/reduced lane width on 84 th, new sidewalks increasing pedestrian safety, speed trailer
usage and the 40’ truck limit.

Earlier this year Clyde Hill conducted a new traffic study with Medina. The purpose of
the study was to understand more about current traffic patterns, suggest ways to
manage problems and see if any design changes to proposed work on 24 th/84th (north of
24th) could be used to address any of the discovered problems. The final study report
was just completed and is attached. Overall, here is what they found:

       Local roads are not a problem when the 520 mainline is flowing
       When the mainline is clogged, Clyde Hill experiences city-wide implications
             -   Only M-F, pm peak times (4pm to 7pm)




                                                                                             Page 3 of 122




                                                                                                  Page 5 of 180
2016 TRAFFIC STUDY OVERVIEW:
 • Prior to study, solicited community input. The online community survey and open
 house confirmed the initial study purpose and the need to focus on the 84 th corridor to
 manage cut through traffic (p.6)

• 2016 traffic volumes are lower than they were in 2006. Minimal to moderate growth is
expected by 2030 (p.8)

• Problem: The longer there is congestion on SR 520, the greater the chance that
regional trips will divert onto city streets (p.9)

• Intersection level of service summary: The intersections at these interchange areas
can serve the 2030 traffic volumes assuming that SR 520 performs well (p.10)

• Origin-destination study and travel time study – trips that start outside of Clyde Hill
and Medina, account for 70% to 80% of the volume during weekday commute peaks
(p.11+)

• Bellevue Way is a Push - traffic studies showed that regional travelers have about an
even trade-off when considering route choices during heavy congestion on WB SR 520.
The extra travel time if they access SR 520 at Bellevue Way, is about 6 minutes during
heavy congestion and the extra time on local routes via 84th Avenue is about 5 or 6
minutes. Many regional travelers are facility agnostic, and typically will seek the shortest
time path regardless of the route (p.14)

5 Ideas to reduce cut through traffic: (p.14+)
#1 -Reduce peak hour vehicle capacity approaching 84th interchange during
weekday pm peak to make it less attractive for regional travelers. The general idea is
to extend the travel time along diversion routes as congestion builds on WB SR 520.
No preferential treatment is given to local users because the capacity reduction affects
all uses (p.14)
   Options to consider:  
   Reduce maximum green time at traffic signals NB on Bellevue Way that are making
   left-turns toward 84th…primarily at 24th
   Reduce the metering rate entering WB SR 520 on-ramp from the general purpose
   lanes. The HOV bypass lane would be unaffected  
   All-way flashing red signals at 84th/24th during the weekday PM peak hours. This
   could be triggered by the time of day, or dynamically with new signals

#2 Strengthen Traffic Calming to increase safety and reduce speeds (p.15)
   Options to consider:  
   Raised pavement crosswalks along with high visibility signage
   Radar speed signs…Excessive speeding causes the sign to flash red with the text
   “SLOW DOWN” to warn drivers to reduce speeds greatly to match the speed limit




                                                                                               Page 4 of 122




                                                                                                    Page 6 of 180
#3 Reduce Queue Impacts near Medina Circle and Hawthorne Ct (p.16)
   Options to consider:  
   Post do not block signs and add pavement markings
#4 Wait for completion of 520 improvements (p.17)
   Options to consider:  
   Wait to see the full effects of the 520 construction before making permanent or
   costly changes
#5 Coordinate w/Bellevue (p.17)
   Options to consider:
   Communicate to Bellevue commuters that Bellevue Way is a major route to SR 520
   Signal timing changes to reduce left turn volume from Bellevue Way onto 24th
Summary & Conclusions: (p.19)
 • Local conditions are greatly influenced by the operations of the freeway, when SR
 520 is operating normally, the local system works
 • Travel times on Bellevue Way tend to remain steady regardless of the freeway
 • 70% to 80% of cut through traffic during the weekday pm commute originates in
 Bellevue
 Recommended traffic management solutions:
 Educate downtown Bellevue commuters about the benefits of traveling on Bellevue
 Way. It provides direct access to SR 520 and has a travel time that remains fairly
 steady regardless of the variation of congestion along westbound SR 520.  
 Provide a continuous bike facility on 84th. A continuous bicycle facility that extends
 north would provide safety to bicyclists along the corridor.
 Install the latest traffic signal control system at the intersection of 84th/24th to take
 advantage of the advanced traffic management methods.
 Interconnect communications for the new signal with the City of Bellevue’s signal
 system or WSDOT’s detector system to adjust the local timing plans, accordingly, with
 coordination with both agencies. Conduct pilot testing of the selected management
 plan prior to permanent installation.  

COUNCIL STUDY SESSION:
In July, the Council asked the staff to set up a study session to discuss the results of the
traffic study and develop a strategy to address the associated cut through and speeding
problems. There is a recognition that some of the possible elements of a plan could be
done on a more immediate basis while others would need additional funding through the
2017 Budget, so the timing of this discussion (before the budget development) is ideal.
At 6pm on Tuesday August 9 th the staff will be prepared to skim over the above traffic
study information, share additional traffic management and traffic calming ideas then be
available for comment or further assistance. The intent of the brief presentation is to
provide the Council with some potential building blocks to consider in its discussion to
construct a cut through traffic policy.

TO:           Mayor & Council
FROM:         Mitch Wasserman
DATE:         August 5, 2016
RE:           STUDY SESSION – Nuts & Bolts
To help guide the study session discussions, the staff suggests the group reviews the most
recent traffic study and current road system condition information, articulates the problem(s)
it wants to solve/manage, agrees on a set of principles associated with the problem and
ultimately picks or begins to sift out some ideas it would like to see the City use to address
the problem.
To help the discussion get started, the staff has developed the information below:

Current Condition:
Appendix A of the Traffic Study includes traffic count data taken for the following locations:
          84th/520 Interchange:
            Peak traffic hour: 4:45 pm – 5:45 pm

          Bellevue Way/520 WB on-ramp:
            Peak traffic hour: 4:30 pm – 5:30 pm

          Bellevue Way/520 EB off-ramp:
            Peak traffic hour: 4:45 pm – 5:45 pm

          84th/24th Intersection
            Peak traffic hour: 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm

          84th/12th Intersection
            Peak traffic hour: 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm

          92nd/24th Intersection
            Peak traffic hour: 4:45 pm – 5:45 pm

          92nd/Pts Dr
            Peak traffic hour: 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm

          100th/24th Intersection
            Peak traffic hour: 4:45 pm – 5:45 pm

          92nd/8th
            Peak traffic hour: 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm

The traffic counts, along with information about an intersection’s level of service (p.10 of the
Traffic Study) provides a good quantitative start to understand the current condition of the road
system. The Introduction of the Traffic Study summarizes the current condition:
   “When SR 520 is congested, regional traffic diverts onto the local city’s street systems and
   significantly alters travel conditions in those neighborhoods. The 84th Avenue NE approach
   to SR 520 has been observed as being the most impacted city street. The purpose of this
   traffic management plan is to better understand this regional traffic diversion, which can
   vary from day-to-day, and then to develop local solutions to manage this traffic that impacts
   the safety and livability of these communities.”

Problems:
 Cut Through Traffic
 Commuters breaking traffic laws (Speeding – Stop Signs – No Left Turns…)


Policy Principle Ideas:
 What are we trying to do and why? The more focused our objectives, the easier they will
 be to implement, manage and explain. This topic covers a number of possible and
 somewhat interrelated objectives that could include one or more of the following. This list
 is used in Bellevue to help focus its neighborhood traffic management program:
    Manage Traffic Volume:
      - Reduce the number of cut-through vehicles on a residential street
    Improve Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety
      - Create a more inviting and safer place to walk and bike
    Educate the Community
      - Create awareness around traffic safety through targeted education and outreach
    Manage Neighborhood Parking
      - Address parking from businesses and schools that spillover into neighborhoods
    Heighten School Zone Awareness
       -Heighten awareness and traffic safety in and around elementary school zones

Other objectives could include reducing truck traffic, reducing noise, vibration and air
pollution, reducing accidents.


The following set of principles is the staff’s attempt to share something we believe the
Council is looking for and can use as a starting point for further discussion:

                Draft – Clyde Hill Cut Through Traffic Policy Principles:
 1. Reduce Cut through Traffic
    Focus on making it harder for traffic to cut through CH between 4pm to 7pm (m to f)
     - 70% to 80% of those using CH streets at this time are commuters going to SR 520
     - Communicate policy to the 20%-30% so they know how to adapt their travel plans

 2. Increase Police Department visibility between 4pm to 7pm (m to f)
      - Message: Don’t break traffic laws or commit crimes in CH…you will be caught
      - Make cutting through CH a higher risk if commuters disregard speed/other laws

 3. Communicate progress of any strategy to Council/community
     - Also to evaluate effectiveness – when to change/stop
     - Current perception may not be the actual reality…share information for more
       accurate perceptions and tips to keep crime low




                                                                                               Page 8 of 122




                                                                                                   Page 10 of 180
Ideas to Achieve Goals:
The following is a list of over 50 ideas generated by
the staff. There are other ideas out there that the
staff did not think of that can also be included and
discussed. Not all of these ideas are “good” ideas.
Many come with high costs or associated
implementation problems. However, all ideas are
presented at this time for further discussion, which
could include quickly eliminating them, spin off
thoughts or additional conversation about their
cost/benefit or implementation feasibility. These
ideas are grouped into cut-through traffic
management ideas and traffic calming or speeding related ideas…the ideas are not
presented in any order of preference.

                           Cut Through Traffic Management Ideas:

24th/84th Traffic Signal Related:
   New traffic signal @ 24th/84th
       - Give less priority to NB traffic between 4 to 7pm
       - Flashing red signal @ 20 th/84th…only turn on between 4 to 7pm
   Red light camera @ 24th/84th
     - Can be real and operating or fake
   Install curb or “skinny permanent cones” between lanes on NB 84 th just north of 24th

24th Ideas
   Install new traffic signals at 24th/92nd
   Install new traffic signals at 24 th/98th
   Install no right turn on red sign at WB 24 th to NB 84th
   Add more "traffic calming efforts" on 24 th
     - Need specific ideas/locations

12th/84th Ideas
   Eliminate or restrict “facilitated” right turn lane from WB 12 th to NB 84th
       - require them to make a rt turn at the intersection
       - make existing R-turn on to 84th for HOV/transit only

92nd Avenue Related:
   4-way stop or flashing red signal at 92nd/20th
      - only turn flashing on between 4 to 7pm
   4-way stop or flashing red signal at 92nd/14th
      - only turn flashing on between 4 to 7pm
   Add more "traffic calming efforts" on 92 nd
     -- Need specific ideas/locations
Reduce lane width on 92 nd (24th to 12th) from 12+’ to 11’ lanes
     - Use wider gore line stripes (4” to 6”)

Traffic Signal @ 24th/Bellevue Way
   Give less time/priority to WB left turners




                                                                                           Page 9 of 122




                                                                                               Page 11 of 180
   Put signals on 4-way flash (4 to 7pm)

Bellevue Assisted Projects
   Work w/Bellevue to communicate Bellevue Way as a good/better alternative
      - As part of their TDM plan?
   Install additional guide signs pointing folks to SR 520 via Bellevue Way
       - On Bellevue Way @ 24 th
   Work w/Bellevue to get $ for improvements where they generate the cut through traffic
     - develop a location list

92nd/Pts Dr Ideas
   Install no left turn sign (4pm to 7pm M-F) at NB 92nd to WB Pts Dr
   92nd/Pts Dr. Intersection
      - Make into a 5-way stop intersection
      - Install a Flashing signal
      - Install a new Traffic signal
      - Install a new L-turn lane from SB 92nd to Pts Dr.
      - Turn intersection into a Traffic circle
   Increase time on ramp meter at 92 nd on-ramp

86th/12th Ideas
   Close 86th @ 12th - In conjunction with any other efforts that make this route a new
   short cut. Some closure ideas include:
       - Cul-de-sac
       - Temp closure in PM only
       - Allow out but not in.
       - No right hand turns from 4 to 7

SR 520 Related Ideas
  Close the 84th on-ramp to SR 520
     - Only close between 4 to 7pm, m-f
   Increase time on 84th on-ramp metering
       - Make Bellevue Way a quicker alternative
   Close the 92nd on-ramp to SR 520
      - Only close between 4 to 7pm, m-f
   Increase time on 92nd on-ramp metering
       - Make Bellevue Way a quicker alternative

Non Location Specific Ideas
  Organize “chaos teams” to report false information to WAZE and other traffic apps
     - How to out-smart the smart apps…needs others to confirm false information
     - Have PD part of this too
   Use the construction of the 84/24 Phase II project to help re-train commuters
      - schedule that work strategically
   Do nothing right now…wait for the completion of the west side 520 improvements

                                   What Is Traffic Calming?
Traffic calming has become a more common municipal term to describe techniques used to
help slow traffic down or better manage traffic. The term means something different from
city to city but is usually understood to mean a range of methods that attempt to physically
change the look/feel of the road and the adjacent “road environment” to make the driver a
little less comfortable so they will slow down. A number of other benefits are known to be
associated with traffic calming that include enhanced aesthetics, increased safety and less
pollution. These methods can also help to frustrate cut through traffic by slowing down
drivers but traffic calming is not usually intended as the sole method for this objective. The
most effective traffic calming plans include three main elements: engineering, education
and enforcement.

Traffic calming can be tricky to talk about unless you get specific. For example, one traffic
calming method is the use of “speed bumps”. A speed bump could mean a speed hump,
speed table, raised crosswalk, raised intersection, textured pavement, speed lump, speed
cushion or a split speed hump…I probably missed a few as well. It’s just important for us to
know that the topic comes with a generally accepted broad set of terms/methods but does
not come with a defined set of specific standards used to implement these ideas. It is up to
each community to decide the right mix of ideas and the best way to implement those ideas.

We did not outline all the possible traffic calming ideas below but have attached a few
articles that help to explain what traffic calming could look like, what it is intended to do, its
effectiveness in other cities and some older cost estimates. The following references are
intended to share information about:

   • Kirkland Article – Good traffic calming pros/cons
   • TDM Encyclopedia – shows effectiveness of technique and 2011 cost estimates
   • FHWA Traffic Calming Article – p. 7 Bellevue’s speed hump evaluation
   • Bellevue Traffic Study Guidelines – Describes their traffic management program and
   the benefits of their techniques
In general, when we talk about traffic calming, the following methods are envisioned:

 Lane Narrowing
      - Intended to slow traffic down...can be done by adding bike lanes, bollards, plante rs,
         sidewalks
 Curb Extensions (bulb out or neck down)
      - Narrows the roadway width, usually in conjunction with a pedestrian crossing
 Choker
      - Narrows the road down to a single lane
 Lane Reduction (Road Diet)
      - Reduce amount of pavement…driving lanes
 Pedestrian Refuges
      - Can be small islands in the middle of the street that increase ped safety but also act to
         reduce the lane width
      - Can also be used with curb extensions
 Textured Pavement
      - A road can be stamped or colored to help it stand out and highlight things like a mid-
         block crosswalk or the entrance to a residential neighborhood
 Chicanes
      - A set of bump outs or road curves that force traffic to slow down
 Blocking or Restricting Access
      - There are many ways to accomplish this from signs to physical islands or cul-de-sacs




                                                                                                     Page 11 of 122

 Speed Bumps
       - Generally referred to as meaning the taller, more compact road impediments that
          require slower speeds or result in more violent reactions
 Speed Humps
       - A little lower and elongated speed bump…less aggressive
 Speed Cushion (speed tables)
       - Longer and flatter bumps in the road…can also be engineered to allow wider
          emergency vehicles to straddle them
 Raised Crosswalks
       - A crosswalk highlighted with textured/colored pavement and a speed cush ion
 Traffic Circles
       - Smaller roundabouts as islands in the middle of residential intersections
 Roundabouts
       - You know these…


                     Traffic Calming or Speeding Related Ideas:
Use additional traffic calming techniques to slow down traffic:
      - Lane Narrowing
      - Landscaping next to road
      - Pedestrian refuges/Curb Extensions at key intersections
      - Raised Crosswalks/Speed humps in conjunction with mid-block pedestrian crossings
Install solar speed signs that say “slow down”
       - Develop a location list
Install more/larger speed signs
       - Develop a location list
Paint speed limit on roads
      - Develop a location list
Police Related Ideas:
 Directed Police Patrols
      - Extra focus between hours of 4 to 7pm…be very visible to commuters
      - Strategic focus for speeders…develop a location list
      - Strategic focus for stop sign infractions…develop a location list
      - Strategic focus for no left turns…develop a location list

 Strategic deployment of speed trailer and traffic counters
      - Amend current location list?
      - Use to collect and communicate speeding and volume facts


Ideas to Evaluate How It’s Working:
Collect before/during/after traffic volume/speed data
       - Develop list/schedule…can’t do it all at once
       - Focus on cut thru problems first?

1.0    Introduction

       State Route 520 (SR 520) is the primary regional route for travel across the north end of Lake
       Washington. It connects the east side cities to the greater City of Seattle area. Near the east end
       of the lake bridge, SR 520 directly serves the Cities of Clyde Hill, Medina, Hunts Point and Yarrow
       Point. Access to SR 520 is provided at 84th Avenue NE and 92nd Avenue NE. When SR 520 is
       congested, regional traffic diverts onto the local city’s street systems and significantly alters
       travel conditions in those neighborhoods. The 84th Avenue NE approach to SR 520 has been
       observed as being the most impacted city street. The purpose of this traffic management plan is
       to better understand this regional traffic diversion, which can vary from day-to-day, and then to
       develop local solutions to manage this traffic that impacts the safety and livability of these
       communities.

       In 2011, under supervision of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), the
       State Route 520 (SR 520) Bridge Replacement Program started construction of the new SR 520
       bridge spanning across Lake Washington. Eastside construction began in 2011 and was
       completed in spring 2016. The new SR 520 bridge is open to traffic. Construction crews have
       started work on upgrading the west side approach to SR 520, which is expected to finish next
       summer.


2.0    Project Location and Study Area

       The project location is along 84th Avenue from just south of the SR 520 ramp roundabout to NE
       24th Street. To examine travel patterns within the surrounding area, the study area from 84th
       Avenue NE on the west to Bellevue Way NE on the east, and NE 8th Street on the south to the SR
       520 Ramps to the north. Bellevue Way NE, Lake Washington Blvd NE and 84th Avenue NE were
       corridors highlighted in the analysis as well as 11 key study intersections. Figure 1 shows the
       project location, key study intersections, as well as a summary of the functional classifications
       within the study area.

2.1    Roadway Description

       Within the study area, 84th Avenue NE is a minor arterial roadway with a three-lane cross-
       section, one lane in each direction with a center median, left turn pockets at key intersections
       and bike lanes in each direction between NE 12th Street and NE 24th Street. From NE 24th Street
       to the SR 520 roundabout, the roadway changes to a four-lane cross-section with no center
       median and no bike facilities. The speed limit along the corridor is 35 MPH.

       The remaining city streets within Clyde Hill and Medina typically are two-lane roads and they
       have a 25 MPH speed limit. There is one traffic signal in either city is at the intersection of 84th
       Avenue NE and NE 24th Street.


2.2    Existing Traffic Volume

       Intersection turning movement counts were collected during weekday PM peak hours to
       capture peak commuter activity. 24-hour tube counts and origin-destination surveys were
       collected over a week as well. Counts were conducted as follows:

       Turning Movement Counts: Wednesday March 2, 2016, 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm.

       24-Hour Tube Counts and Origin-Destination Surveys: Monday February 29, 2016 to Sunday
       March 6, 2016.

       Turning movement counts can be found in Appendix A. Peak hour traffic volumes were balanced
       to provide the basis for analyzing traffic conditions during peak hours. Pedestrians and bicyclists
       travel through the corridor sparingly during the PM peak and the corresponding volumes are
       relatively low at the intersections.


2.3    Collision Analysis

       Collision history for the past three full calendar years (2013-2015) was reviewed in the study
       area. Within the study area, no collisions resulted in a fatality. Figure 2 shows the collision
       history. Of the 72 total collisions, approximately 29% of those resulted in injury while 71% were
       property damage only collisions.

       Key causes to injury related accidents were failure to grant right-of-way and following too
       closely. Other causes included failure to yield to pedestrians, distracted driving, and disregarding
       stop and go lights. Roadways with crash rates higher than the county average include NE 24th St,
       and Bellevue Way near the SR 520 interchange.

       Accidents and injuries by time of day are shown in Figure 3. About 90% of injury accidents
       occurred during the daytime, while 10% occurred during the AM peak and 52% during the PM
       peak. Figure 4 shows the accidents by type. The three types of accidents predominantly
       occurring in the study area were angled (43%), rear ends (23%) and fixed objects (21%).

3.0    Clyde Hill Traffic Study

3.1    Online Survey and Public Feedback

       Prior to the study, an online survey was taken by residents of Clyde Hill, Medina, Hunts Point
       and Yarrow Point. The survey collected community input to help identify traffic related concerns
       within the study area. Over 550 surveys were completed and a summary can be found in
       Appendix B. The primary feedback from the community showed the following:

              Traffic queues approaching SR 520 was the biggest concern and how those queues
               affect local circulation and safety

              The worst queues occur in the afternoon peak commute hours

              Over 80% of respondents said that the critical improvement needs are on the 84th
               Avenue NE corridor and its intersection at 24th Avenue NE.

       The survey feedback from local community members confirmed the initial understanding of the
       study purpose and the need to focus on the 84th Avenue NE corridor in developing solutions.

3.2    SR 520 Phased Improvement

       SR 520 is one of four toll facilities within the state. Access to SR 520 is provided at 84th Avenue
       NE and 92nd Avenue NE for the Cities of Clyde Hill, Medina, Hunts Point and Yarrow Point. Of
       those two, only the 84th Avenue interchange provides access to westbound SR 20. The next
       interchange to the east is at Bellevue Way, which is a major arterial five-lane facility serving the
       Cities of Bellevue and Kirkland. A new SR 520 bridge with a six-lane cross-section was completed
       to replace the old four-lane facility. The new bridge provides two general-purpose lanes in each
       direction and a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane. The SR 520 Bridge Replacement has been
       broken out into phases of construction with the most recent phase resulting in the floating
       bridge being open to traffic with six lanes leading up to the west end of the floating bridge.
       Figure 5 below shows the phases for project completion for the SR 520 Bridge replacement
       project.

       Traffic growth at the SR 520 interchanges was examined to see the possible impacts to the three
       interchange areas within the study area. Data was used from the 2006 Environmental Impact
       Statement (EIS) developed for the SR 520 construction project. From the EIS, 2006 volumes and
       2030 projections at the interchanges were compared to counts done in 2016. Figure 6 below
       shows the three sets of volumes at the three interchange areas. Currently 2016 volumes are
       lower than they were in 2006. Growth between the 2006 and 2030 projects showed minimal
       growth at both the 84th Avenue NE and 92nd Avenue NE Roundabouts while the Bellevue Way
       (Lake Washington Blvd NE) and SR 520 Ramps were expected to see a more moderate amount
       of growth in 2030. With volumes currently lower than in 2006, these growths could be minimal
       by 2030.

3.3    Duration of Congestion on Westbound SR 520

       Regional traffic diversion onto city street systems occurs periodically along SR 520 in this area.
       To understand how congestion varies from day-to-day, we evaluated travel speed data on SR
       520 for three days of Tuesday March 1st, 2016 to Thursday March 3rd, 2016, which coincided
       with other system observations that were made for this study. Using loop detector data
       provided by WSDOT, travel times between 84th Avenue NE and Bellevue Way along westbound
       SR 520 were analyzed. The PM peak period was isolated (see Figure 7), which illustrates how
       congestion varies from about 1 minute, under free flow conditions, to over 6 minutes. Delays
       begin to increase at 4:00 pm during the three weekdays and grow quite large during the 5:00
       pm to 6:00 pm hour. Tuesday results show that congestion along SR 520 begins an hour earlier
       than it usually does whereas Wednesday and Thursday travel conditions follow the same
       general trend.

       We compared the data collected on the local streets and found that on days where SR 520
       Westbound congestion started earlier there was greater evidence of higher traffic volumes and
       longer delays on the city streets. In other words, the longer duration of severe congestion on SR
       520, the greater chance those regional trips will divert onto city streets.

3.4    Intersection Operations

       Existing intersection conditions operations can be found in Table 1 below. The analysis approach
       and methodology for the intersection operations can be found in Appendix C. The conditions
       reflect local operations on Wednesday, March 2nd 2016, a day where the freeway experienced
       less congestion and queues did not adversely impact local operations. On days where queues
       are present, local operations would show much worse performance than in the table of results
       below. All the intersections operate at LOS C or better outside of unsignalized intersection of
       92nd Avenue NE and NE 24th Street in the PM peak.

       The intersection control at 84th Avenue NE and NE 24th Street was analyzed for signalized,
       roundabout or unsignalized intersection control. The operations at the intersection perform
       equally well with either the traffic signal or the roundabout controls. When the intersection
       control is switched to an all-way stop for the unsignalized intersection control, the northbound
       traffic experiences delays resulting in a LOS F condition.

       Table 2 shows the intersection operations assuming the 2030 projected volumes. The
       intersections at these interchange areas can serve the 2030 traffic volumes assuming that SR
       520 performs well.

3.5    Origin-Destination and Travel Time Study

       The origin-destination (OD) study was done to understand local travel patterns and how they
       vary by time of day. Data was collected at nine locations shown in Figure 8 below for a 10 day
       period. The OD study looked at patterns and travel times between nine sampling stations and
       results varied by day of the week and time of day. The three days of Tuesday March 1st, 2016 to
       Thursday March 3rd, 2016 were highlighted within this study.

       Results showed that travel times along Bellevue Way delivered consistent travel times while
       routes through Clyde Hill and Medina (shown as dashed lines below) increased when SR 520
       westbound is slow. A summary of travel times along these routes are shown in Table 3. The
       extra time along these routes during congested freeway days is similar to the extra time
       observed on the SR 520 WB loop detectors.

       Figure 9 shows Clyde Hill traffic flow results for the origin of Bellevue Way and NE 8th Street on
       Thursday during the PM peak. The larger circles indicate a higher traffic volume at each location
       while the larger bands from origin to destination show a larger amount of traffic flow using the
       route. The results show a significant amount of diversion through Clyde Hill during the PM peak
       period.

       An examination of regional traffic using the PSRC EMME regional traffic model was done to see
       the percentage of regional traffic traveling along 84th Avenue NE. The results showed that
       regional traffic, trips that start outside of Clyde Hill and Medina, accounted for 70% to 80% of
       the volume during weekday commute peaks.

4.0    Potential Management Plan Concepts

       The following section discusses the management plan elements and resulting potential concepts
       to deal with the cut-through traffic and maintaining neighborhood safety.

       With the large amount of traffic diversion to 84th Avenue NE, the objectives for the management
       concepts looked at making diversion routes less attractive to have regional traffic users traveling
       on Bellevue Way instead, where travel times have been steadier and is a roadway that drives
       users to and from the freeway system. Other objectives included minimizing the impacts to local
       users, cost effectiveness and flexibility. The key issues to address with the management
       concepts were queues that approached SR 520, neighborhood cut-through traffic and
       pedestrian and bicycle safety within the area.

       Improvements to the intersection of 84th Avenue NE and NE 24th Street are currently in design.
       Three alternatives have been proposed and a preferred alternative will be determined at a later
       date.


4.1    Concept #1: Reduce Vehicle Capacity

       The first option looks at reducing peak hour vehicle capacity approaching the 84th Avenue
       interchange during the weekday PM peak hours to make it less attractive for regional travelers.
       Our traffic studies showed that regional travelers have about an even trade-off when
       considering routes choices during heavy congestion on westbound SR 520. The extra travel time
       if they access SR 520 at Bellevue Way is about 6 minutes during heavy congestion and the extra
       time on local routes via 84th Avenue NE is about 5 or 6 minutes. Many regional travelers are
       facility agnostic, and typically will seek the shortest time path regardless of the route.

       Multiple options were examined for this concept to influence how traffic is controlled through
       this corridor. The general idea is to extend the travel time along diversion routes as congestion
       builds on SR 520 westbound. The options included the following:

           1. Reduce maximum green time at traffic signals northbound on Bellevue Way that are
               making left-turns toward 84th Avenue. This would primarily be at 24th Avenue NE.




                                                 Page 14




                                                                                                             Page 29 of 122




                                                                                                                  Page 31 of 180
84th Avenue NE Corridor Study                                                              Clyde Hill, WA
Final Neighborhood Traffic Management Report                                                  16026-000

           2. Reduce the metering rate entering westbound SR 520 On-Ramp from the general
                purpose lanes. The HOV bypass lane would be unaffected.

           3. Trigger all-way flashing red signals at 84th Avenue NE and NE 24th Street during the
                weekday PM peak hours. This could be triggered by the time of day, or dynamically
                based on traffic inputs, such as the loop detectors used on SR 520.

       This concept addresses the objectives by making this diversion route less attractive by
       minimizing the green time that vehicles can travel through intersections. It is also flexible and
       allows for adjustments based on time of day to address the high demand during the PM peak
       hours while being easy to revert back to the existing conditions. We recommend that the any
       management option be evaluated through a pilot testing process to consider the effectiveness
       of the treatment in solving the diversions, and possible negative impacts of added delays for
       local trips.

       As in Transportation Policy 1.3 in the Clyde Hill Comprehensive Plan, designing 84th Avenue NE
       and NE 24th Street as an intersection that serves the community efficiently and effectively
       throughout the day is key. The design should not be limited to serving the community only
       during the peak periods solely because of the congestion during this time period. The design
       should address the needs of the community during the whole day to provide use and limit
       impacts to the local users who are using the facility outside the PM peak as well as during it.

       The issues that result from this concept include impacts to all vehicles, both local and regional
       traffic using the corridor. No preferential treatment is given to local users because the capacity
       reduction affects all uses. Finally, the changing of traffic signal timing may impact safety as users
       adjust to the new green times.


4.2    Concept #2: Strengthen Traffic Calming

       The second concept looks at strengthening traffic calming in locations around the study area to
       increase safety and reduce traffic speeds. Solutions include raised pavement crosswalks within
       the city or radar speed signs with the posted speed limit for the roadway.

       Raised pavement crosswalks along with high visibility signage provide pedestrians with
       pavement crossings that are above the roadway surface and let users know that a crosswalk is

                                                 Page 15




                                                                                                               Page 30 of 122




                                                                                                                    Page 32 of 180
84th Avenue NE Corridor Study                                                              Clyde Hill, WA
Final Neighborhood Traffic Management Report                                                  16026-000

       ahead. The raised surface also forces vehicles to slow down as they cross the surface to reduce
       damage to their vehicle. Radar speed signs display the current speed limit along the roadway as
       well as let users know how fast they are traveling. The sign flashes with their current speed as
       vehicles exceed the speed limit, letting the driver know to slow down. Excessive speeding causes
       the sign to flash red with the text “SLOW DOWN” to warn drivers to reduce speeds greatly to
       match the speed limit.

       The concept has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing speeds due to the physical nature of
       the infrastructure. It also improves pedestrian crossings and safety. Issues with the concept
       include the solutions being less effective in reducing volumes, the infrastructure being more
       permanent and the higher constructions costs.


4.3    Concept #3: Reduce Queue Impacts

       The third concept looks at reducing queue impacts from recurring blockages. Two areas for this
       improvement are in Medina Circle and Hawthorne Court. The solution looks at posting DO NOT
       BLOCK signs (as seen in Figure 10) and adding pavement markings to delineate the area that
       needs to be vacated from blockages. Figure 11 below shows an example layout for the
       pavement markings and signage that would be put into place. The benefits to this solution allow
       for vehicles to turn into residential areas during times when queuing is an issue on local streets,
       benefiting the local user. It does not address the queuing issues directly and could have safety
       concerns of drivers fail to yield as local vehicles are making turns into and out of residential
       areas.

4.4    Concept #4: Completion of SR 520 Improvements

       Another concept is to hold off on temporary solutions until the SR 520 improvements are
       completed. Because SR 520 drives much of the local system during the PM peak period, waiting
       to see the full effects from the SR 520 improvements could help drive other solutions while
       reducing the construction costs for temporary fixes that may not be beneficial or necessary
       when SR 520 is complete.


4.5    Concept #5: Coordinate with City and State Agencies

       The last concept highlights Transportation Policy 1.1 in the Clyde Hill Comprehensive Plan, which
       would be to coordinate with surrounding agencies. Coordination with the City of Bellevue on
       strategies to manage turning volume from Bellevue Way could help. Examples include an
       emphasis on Bellevue Way as a major route to SR 520 in traffic demand management (TDM)

       goals, as opposed to drivers using other alternative routes through Clyde Hill, or signal timing
       changes to reduce left turn volume from Bellevue Way onto 24th Street NE. Coordination with
       the City of Bellevue and WSDOT will be necessary to obtain data, procedures and methodology
       which can provide necessary information along key roadways surrounding the 84th Avenue NE
       corridor. Real-time data and the ability to connect it to the 84th Avenue NE/24th Street NE
       intersection would be key components to a management concept that would rely on conditions
       in surrounding areas that can vary greatly.

5.0    Summary and Conclusions

       From the study, it can be seen that the local system conditions are greatly influenced by the
       operations of the freeway system. When SR 520 is operating normally, the local system works.
       When freeway congestion occurs along westbound SR 520, the queuing along nearby blocks and
       driveways start to build up and more traffic diverts to 84th Avenue NE. Throughout the different
       conditions along SR 520, travel times on Bellevue Way tend to remain steady. Results show a
       large diversion onto 84th Avenue NE and regional traffic accounts for approximately 70% to 80%
       of traffic along 84th Avenue NE during the weekday commute periods.

       The suggested traffic management solutions listed in the management plan concepts section are
       solutions that are temporary and provide partial fixes. Moving forward, the following is
       recommended:

           1. Educating downtown Bellevue commuters about the benefits of traveling on Bellevue
               Way. It provides direct access to SR 520 and has a travel time that remains fairly steady
               regardless of the variation of congestion along westbound SR 520.

           2. Providing a continuous bike facility on 84th Avenue NE. A bike facility currently extends
               north along 84th Avenue NE between NE 12th Street and just south of NE 24th Street in
               both directions. A continuous bicycle facility that extends north would provide safety to
               bicyclists along the corridor.

           3. Install latest traffic signal control system at the intersection of 84th Avenue NE and NE
               24th Street to take advantage of the advanced traffic management methods mentioned
               in Concept #1. This intersection would be operated as a stand-alone location during
               most hours of the day.

           4. Interconnect communications for the new signal with the City of Bellevue’s signal
               system or WSDOT’s detector system to adjust the local timing plans, accordingly, with
               coordination with both agencies as mentioned in Concept #5. Conduct pilot testing of
               the selected management plan prior to permanent installation.

Level of service (LOS) is the term used to denote the different operating conditions which occur
on a given roadway segment under various traffic volume loads and operating conditions. It is a
qualitative measure used to describe a quantitative analysis taking into account factors such as
roadway geometrics, signal phasing, speed, travel delay, freedom to maneuver, and safety. LOS
provides an index to the operational qualities of a roadway segment or an intersection. LOS
designations range from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F
representing the worst operating conditions. LOS designation is reported differently for
signalized, roundabout and unsignalized intersections.

Signalized intersections were analyzed under PM peak hour conditions. Average vehicle delay
and LOS were determined utilizing the methodology found in Chapter 18 of the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM), with the assistance of the Synchro (version 9.1) traffic simulation
software.

Unsignalized intersections were analyzed under PM peak hour conditions. Average vehicle delay
and LOS were determined based upon the procedures found in Chapter 19 of the 2010 HCM,
with the assistance of the Synchro (version 9.1) traffic simulation software. Typically, the LOS for
an unsignalized intersection is reported for the approach that has the highest average delay per
vehicle.
