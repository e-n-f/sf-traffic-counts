MEMORANDUM
DATE:       April 3, 2017

TO:         Michael Houston, Seattle DCI
            Marijana Cvenček, Baylis Architects

FROM:       Michael Read, PE, Principal, TENW

SUBJECT:     Greenwood Phase 3 Mixed Use (MUP 3026306) ă Traffic and Parking Impact Analysis
             TENW Project No. 3499
This memorandum summarizes the results of a traffic impact and parking demand analysis
associated with a proposed development of a mixed use project known as the Greenwood Phase
3 Mixed Use project in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle, WA. Upon completion, the
proposed project would construct a multi-story complex with up to 154 apartment units and
approximately 4,000 square-feet of ground floor commercial retail uses. In addition to review of
traffic and parking demand, traffic operational impacts at the vicinity intersections that would serve
as site access to the project are also included.

Project Description
The proposed project is located at 8612 Palentine Avenue N (MUP 3026306). A project site
vicinity map is provided in Figure 1. A ground-floor conceptual site plan is provided in Figure 2.
The proposed project would include 154 apartment units and approximately 4,000 square-feet of
ground floor specialty retail uses fronting along a mid-block alleyway that has been developed
between Greenwood Avenue N and Palentine Avenue N. The site is currently undeveloped, and
as such, there is no formal vehicle access. On-site parking for 105 vehicles would be provided
within a 2-level underground level garage. A single site access driveway onto Palentine Avenue N
is proposed. Project completion and full occupancy is expected by 2020.


Project Trip Generation Analysis
Published trip rate equations compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation, 9th Edition, 2012, were used to estimate daily, a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic that
would be generated by the proposed development assuming new Mid-Rise Apartment uses (ITE
Land Use Code 223) and Specialty Retail Uses (ITE Land Use Code 826), with consideration for
removal of existing land uses (residential apartment units only).

As shown in Table 1, an estimated net increase of approximately 1,192 daily, 57 a.m. (19
entering and 38 exiting), and 74 p.m. peak hour vehicular trips (41 entering and 33 exiting)
would be generated with redevelopment of the site when applying standard ITE trip generation

rates. However, given the siteÊs proximity to the vicinity retail, banking, entertainment, civic, and
restaurant uses and the frequent fixed route transit service on Greenwood Avenue and N 85th
Street, a mode share adjustment is warranted to refine standard trip generation rates. Applying a
moderate access mode shares adjustment from other similar studies completed by TENW, a 10
percent reduction in residential trips would result in a net increase of approximately 1,090 new
daily, 52 new a.m. peak hour trips, and 67 p.m. peak hour trips. A detailed summary of trip
generation calculations is provided in Attachment A.

Parking Demand Analysis
A parking impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the removal of existing supply/demand
generated by the proposed project. The parking impact analysis reviewed:
     City of Seattle parking requirements.
     Parking demand of proposed commercial development using ITE rates.


City of Seattle Parking Requirements

Based upon City of Seattle off-street parking standards (Seattle Municipal Code Title 23.54.015 ă
Chart A Parking), Table 2 summarizes minimum off-street parking stalls required. As shown the
project is within a designated Urban Village of Greenwood, the City of Seattle would require no
off-street parking for either proposed residential use given the frequent transit service available
along Greenwood Avenue and N 85th Street that is within 500 feet of the subject property (less
than the required 1,320 feet). As the project is proposing 105 stalls, the on-site parking would
exceed this minimum requirement.

Project Parking Demand

For the project, the Institute of Transportation Engineers Parking Generation, Fourth Edition, 2010,
transit availability, walkability factors, and the size/location of office use were all considered to
determine parking demand for the proposed mixed use project at 8612 Palentine Avenue. Based
upon Land Use Code 221 for Low/Mid-Rise Apartments and Shopping Center (LUC 820) for
specialty retail uses, direct application of published rates in Parking Generation, 4th Edition,
estimate the peak development parking demand at a total of 156 parking stalls (see Table 3).

Given transit service availability immediately adjacent to the site on Greenwood Avenue and N
85th Street (within 50 feet of the site), a 20 percent reduction in parking demand is expected for
these factors. In addition, with a high Walk Score of 95, this particular project site and vicinity
demonstrates that many typical trips can be achieved via nonmotorized modes. Given the location

40 percent reduction in residential parking demand is estimated in ITE parking generation rates.
This finding is nearly equivalent to the King County Right Size Parking model (see Attachment B),
which recommends a „built‰ parking stall ratio of 0.61 stalls per unit or 94 stalls when charging for
parking that is charged separately than the lease rate itself.

The parking demand analysis above does not consider time of day factors, when during typical
weekday days residential demand decreases down to 75 percent of peak when specialty retail
peak occurs, and evening hours when residential uses peak and no retail demand is generated.
Based upon the proposed on-site supply of 105 stalls, no on-street parking during peak evening
hours or during typical daytime periods is expected.

Traffic Operational Impacts and Site Access Evaluation

Baseline Traffic Volumes and Trip Distribution

Peak hour traffic volumes represent the highest hourly volume of vehicles passing through an
intersection during a typical 4-6 p.m. weekday peak period. Peak period turning movement counts
at study intersections were conducted in October 2016 by IDAX Data Solutions, and are provided
in Attachment C and shown on Figure 3. Based on existing traffic patterns and routes to/from the
vicinity arterials, a general distribution of 20 percent north on Greenwood Avenue N, 5 percent
west on N 87th Street, 15 percent west and 35 percent east on N 85th Street, and 25 percent
south on Greenwood Avenue N was applied (Figure 4). Intersection level of service (LOS)
analyses were conducted at the study intersections during the weekday PM peak hour of existing
conditions and with project traffic generated at full buildout of the Greenwood Phase 3 Mixed Use
project. 2020 baseline traffic volumes were estimated by applying a 1 percent per year
background growth factor and additional project traffic generated by pipeline projects:

   9002 Greenwood Ave N (28 residential units)
   9038 Greenwood Avenue N (78 apartments and 6 live-work units)
   308 N 90th Street (37 efficiency dwelling units)

Attachment D summarizes 2016, pipeline project trips, and 2020 forecasts with and without the
proposed Greenwood Phase 3 Mixed Use project, while Figure 5 overviews p.m. peak hour
turning movement impacts of the project.


Intersection Level of Service (LOS) Impacts

LOS refers to the degree of congestion on a roadway or intersection. It is a measure of vehicle
operating speed, travel time, travel delays, and driving comfort. A letter scale from A to F
generally describes LOS. At signalized intersections, LOS A represents free-flow conditions-
motorists experience little or no delays, and LOS F represents forced-flow conditions-motorists
experience an average delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. The LOS reported for
signalized intersections represents the average control delay for all vehicles entering the
intersection. The LOS reported at stop-controlled intersections is also based on the average control
delay (sec/veh), but is reported for stop controlled and yield movements only. Table 4 outlines the
LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections based on these methodologies.

Estimated project intersection LOS impacts during the p.m. peak hour in 2020 are summarized in
Table 5. As shown, the proposed redevelopment results in negligible level of service impacts at the
study intersections (operating at LOS c or better). As such, no significant adverse traffic impacts would
occur as a result of the project. Detailed LOS summary worksheets for existing conditions and in
2020 with and without the project are included in Attachment E.

Site Access and Safety Issues

Vehicular site access is proposed via one site access driveway onto Palentine Avenue N. Entering
sight distance along this is in excess of 300 feet in either direction. Existing and future „roadway
friction‰ factors that would be present along this local street (street trees, landscape strip, on-street
parking) limit vehicle speeds, and as such, no site access, safety, or circulation issues are expected
to occur with the distribution of the proposed parking garages onto Palentine Avenue N.

An existing alleyway that serves the subject property and adjacent/adjoining properties to the north
ends in a dead-end near the southeast quadrant of the subject property and ranges between 14
and 16 feet wide where paved. Per Table C in SMC 23.53.030, Required Minimum Right-of-
Way Widths for Existing Alleys, the current alleyway does not have the minimum width for the
underlying land use NC2 zone to be considered as „improved‰. In addition, given the existing
width and the lack of property control along its entire length, the code required alleyway access is
not feasible as safe and adequate two-way circulation for garage access/egress via the alleyway
would not be provided. Furthermore, per Figure 4-26, Seattle Right-of-Way Manual and

     TENW                                                                                                   April 3, 2017

23.53.025, Access easement standards D, the minimum paved width for 2-way circulation of 10
or more residential units is 20 feet, which canÊt be met along the entire alleyway length to NE 87th
Street.

The proposed driveway location onto Palentine Avenue N is offset by approximately 35 feet
(measured centerline-to-centerline) from an opposing driveway that serves a surface parking lot
behind a commercial retail mixed use building. Given this off-set is less than 50 feet, driver
alignment and sight distance between exiting volumes from either driveway while not ideal would
be adequate to avoid turning conflicts of exiting vehicles.

Given the level of residential density added in comparison to „built‰ conditions within the
neighborhood, no significant impacts are expected given high levels of transit service and
nonmotorized facilities already present and in use within the Greenwood neighborhood.

Transportation Concurrency

Prior to development approval, a transportation concurrency analysis is conducted based on the
City of SeattleÊs DirectorÊs Rule 5-2009. Transportation concurrency standards are used to
determine the acceptable balance between the demand for use of the arterial systems and the
capacity of the transportation system. Total capacity is based not only on the facilities currently in
existence, but also on known future projects.

Transportation concurrency review in the City of Seattle is evaluated first by determining applicable
screenlines. A screenline is an imaginary line drawn across several arterials at a particular location
where the volume to-capacity ratio (v/c) is calculated. The following screenlines were evaluated:
            1.11 North City Limit ă 3rd Avenue NW to Aurora Avenue N
            6.12 South of NE 80th Street ă 8th Avenue NW to Greenwood Avenue N

Baseline traffic volumes for the screenline were obtained from the DirectorÊs Rule 5-2009. Project-
generated traffic was then added to baseline traffic volumes at the screenline. The total traffic
volume, including the proposed developments trips, was then divided by the capacity of all
roadways crossing the screenline to obtain a volume to capacity (v/c) ratio. This ratio was then
compared to the LOS standard. Table 6 summarizes the transportation concurrency review results
for the Greenwood Phase 3 Mixed Use development. As shown, the v/c ratios with the
development were less than the LOS standard for all screenlines. Therefore, no system concurrency
mitigation is required.

Conclusions
The proposed Greenwood Phase 3 Mixed Use development at 8612 Palentine Avenue N was
evaluated for increased traffic demands, traffic operational impacts, and parking demands. A net
increase of approximately 1,090 new daily, 52 new a.m. peak hour trips, and 67 new p.m.
peak hour vehicular trips are estimated, and are not expected to generate any significant adverse
traffic impacts. No off-site traffic operational impacts are expected to occur as a result of the
proposed project at the study intersections that serve the immediate site vicinity.

With the proposed on-site supply of 105 stalls, the project is expected to generate demand no
new demand for on-street parking during peak evening hours or during typical daytime periods.
