                     Application of Criteria for a Project of Air Quality Concern
Project Title: Laurel Access to Mills, Maxwell Park and Seminary (LAMMPS) Streetscape Project
Project Summary for Air Quality Conformity Task Force Meeting: April 28th 2016


Description
  −   Project will reconfigure the existing traffic lanes along MacArthur Boulevard to add bicycle lanes
      and multi-use pathway/sidewalks to improve safety, appearance, and access for pedestrians,
      bicycles and vehicular traffic.
  −   There are minimal changes to the number of lanes; elimination only and with new traffic signals
      and signal timing optimization, the project will reduce vehicle delay compared to the no-build
      condition with the corridor operating better (less delay and same or better LOS) as the no build
      conditions

Background
  −   NEPA process for Categorical Exemption is almost complete
  −   No comments received on air quality thus far
  −   Seeking air quality conformity determination by April 30, 2016.
  −   Schedule based on deadline for ATP funding allocation through CT DLA/CTC

Not a Project of Air Quality Concern (40 CFR 93.123(b)(1))
(i) New or expanded highway projects with significant number/increase in diesel vehicles?
   − Not a new or expanded highway project
   − AADT (20,832 opening year 2018 and 27,016 horizon year 2040) is well under the 125,000
      threshold and truck traffic is relatively low (4%), and will not increase due to the project changes.

(ii) Affects intersections at LOS D, E, or F with a significant number of diesel vehicles?
   − Diesel vehicles represent less than 4% of intersection traffic volume
   − Intersections at LOS D, E, or F remain the same or improve, and delays decrease (2040)
   − No project changes to land use that would affect diesel traffic percentage

(iii) New bus and rail terminals and transfer points?—Not Applicable

(iv) Expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer points?—Not Applicable

(v) Affects areas identified in PM10 or PM2.5 implementation plan as site of violation?
  − No state implementation plan for PM2.5
  − Therefore, not identified in plan as an area of potential violation

Project Description (clearly describe project)

   The objective of the Project is to improve safety, appearance, and access for pedestrian, bicycle, and
   vehicular traffic along a 0.6-mile segment of MacArthur Boulevard between High Street and Richards
   Road. The improvements will include the replacement of existing pavement, sidewalks, curbs, medians,
   islands, traffic signals, streetlights and crosswalks. Traffic lanes will be reconfigured and bike lanes
   and a multi-use path trail will be added. Two new traffic signals at the intersections of MacArthur
   Boulevard/Calaveras Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard/Pierson Street will be installed. Landscaping
   and streetscape improvements will also be included.

   The project will not include additional traffic lanes. The project will not require any additional right-of-
   way or temporary construction easements.

Project Purpose and Need (Summary): (please be brief)
The existing pedestrian paths and bike lanes are discontinuous, and street configurations at several
locations are in conflict with pedestrians and bicyclists path of travel, creating unsafe conditions. The
purpose of the project is to improve bicycle and pedestrian safety and encourage active transportation by
providing continuous and safe paths of travel for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians along the MacArthur
corridor. The goal of the project is to provide safe access for pedestrians and bicyclists accessing Mills
College, public transit and nearby destinations of variety of services; beautify the area; and, improve traffic
flow for pedestrian, bicyclists, and vehicles. (City Project No.: C478810)

Surrounding Land Use/Traffic Generators (especially effect on diesel traffic)
The project is located on MacArthur Boulevard between High Street and Richards Road.
The surrounding area consists of mix land use including retail, services, residential, public transit,
commercial, and school. MacArthur Boulevard provides access to and from I-580, and although trucks are
not prohibited, it is not part of the City of Oakland’s Truck Route network.

Brief summary of assumptions and methodology used for conducting analysis (please keep this concise –
specifics may include date of when traffic counts were conducted, studies where truck percentages were derived)
The following is a summary of the assumptions and methodologies used for conducting a traffic
analysis on the proposed streetscape project on MacArthur Boulevard:
    •   Intersection turn movement counts were collected for the AM (7 – 9 AM) and PM (4 – 6 PM) peak periods
        in November 2015. A total of 7 intersections were selected for analysis.
    •   Vehicle classification and count data were collected at one location over a one week period, 24-hours per
        day in order to estimate AADT and truck percentages.
    •   Intersection LOS was analyzed using both microsimulation (implemented via SimTraffic) and the
        methodologies outlined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (implemented via Synchro 8). LOS findings
        presented in this form are based on the microsimulation as it was better able to model the interaction
        between the closely spaced intersections within the project boundaries.
    •   Cumulative volumes were developed using incremental growth from the latest version of the Alameda
        County Travel Demand Model. For roadways not in the model, percent growth of the nearest centroid
        connector was used to estimate growth on the minor side street approaches.
    •   Truck percentages under cumulative conditions were assumed to stay the same as they are under existing
        conditions.

Describe potential traffic redistribution effects of congestion relief (impact on other facilities)
This project is anticipated to have only minimal redistributive effects. There are minimal changes
to the number of lanes; elimination only. The project will also substantially improve signal timing
on the corridor reducing vehicle delay compared to the no build condition as shown above.
Therefore, the corridor is expected to operate better than the no build condition reducing the
probability of diversion.
                   Project Assessment Form for PM2.5 Interagency Consultation


Comments/Explanation/Details (please be brief)
Section 93.116(a) of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) states that a Federal Highway Administration/Federal
Transit Agency (FHWA/FTA) project must not cause or contribute to any new localized PM2.5 violations or increase
the frequency or severity of any existing PM10 and PM2.5 violations in non-attainment or maintenance areas. The
regulations further state that projects may satisfy this requirement without an analysis of their potential to create PM
hot-spots provided they do not meet the following criteria:
         1) New or expanded highway projects that have a significant number of or significant increase in diesel
         vehicles (significant number is defined as greater than 125,000 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and
         8% or more of such AADT is diesel truck traffic, or in practice 10,000 truck AADT or more regardless of
         total AADT; significant increase is defined in practice as a 10% increase in heavy duty truck traffic);

         2) Projects affecting intersections that are at a Level of Service D, E, F, with a significant number of diesel
         vehicles, or that that will change to Level of Service D, E, or F because of increased traffic volumes from a
         significant number of diesel vehicles related to the project;

         3) New bus and rail terminals and transfer points that have a significant number of diesel vehicles
         congregating at a single location;

         4) Expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer points that significantly increase the number of diesel
         vehicles congregating at a single location; or

         5) Projects in or affecting locations, areas, or categories of sites which are identified in the PM2.5 or PM10
         implementation plan or implementation plan submission, as appropriate, as sites of possible violation.

The project does not meet any of these criteria as outlined below:
The project is limited to the reconfiguration of the existing roadway and intersections and will not create additional
vehicular travel lanes; bicycle and pedestrian facilities will be integrated, including Class II bicycle lanes, multi-use
pathways and sidewalks. Parking will be removed and vehicular travel lanes will be reconfigured to include class II
bicycle lanes. There will be no added or expanded bus or rail stations. No increase in truck traffic is anticipated due
to the project changes. Based on available traffic data estimates, the project is below criteria for Project of Air
Quality Concern (POAQC).
Traffic data has been assessed for existing and horizon years for the build and no-build condition for MacArthur
Boulevard and the 7 study intersections. The traffic data shows that the project will not result in increased traffic
based on the existing or horizon year models. Further, there will be no increase in the percentage of truck traffic
and the delay and Level of Service (LOS) will improve within the project limits.
Criteria 1 is not met since this project does not involve a new or expanded highway. The truck traffic is relatively
low (4%), and will not increase due to the project changes.
Although several intersections are projected to operate at LOS D, E, and F in the horizon year (2040) no-build and
build conditions, the degraded LOS would not be the result of the project. In fact, in year 2040, the project will
reduce delay and improve LOS along the corridor, as compared to no build conditions. Bottom line, Criteria 2 is
not met since the project will not result in increased traffic volumes from a significant number of diesel vehicles.
Criteria 3 and 4 do not apply to this project since the project does not involve bus or rail terminals or transfer
points that have a large number of diesel vehicles at one location.
Criteria 5 is not met since the project is not in, nor affecting locations, areas, or categories of sites identified in the
PM 2.5 or PM 10 implementation plan or implementation plan submission. Further, the project would have no effect
on the number of trucks using MacArthur Boulevard.
Since none of the criteria apply, the project is not a POAQC.

Subject:        East Palo Alto US 101/University Avenue Interchange Improvement Project-
                Traffic Operations Analysis



Introduction
This report has been prepared to present the results of the traffic operations analysis for the East Palo Alto
US 101/University Avenue Interchange Improvement Project.
The City of East Palo Alto is proposing to make improvements to the existing US 101/University Avenue
interchange by modifying the US 101 southbound loop off-ramp and by constructing bicycle and pedestrian
facilities across US 101 along University Avenue. The improvements would consist of widening the existing
intersection of the southbound off-ramp at University Avenue to accommodate dual left-turn lanes and dual
right-turn lanes. The number of lanes on the off-ramp exiting the freeway would remain the same. The
improvements also include reconfiguring the northbound loop off-ramp to bring it closer to the intersection of
University Avenue and Donohoe Street to enhance bicycle and pedestrian safety. Also, an acceleration lane
measuring approximately 200 feet in length is proposed on University Avenue, just south of Donohoe Street
so that vehicles from the northbound loop off-ramp can accelerate before merging into the through traffic on
University Avenue. Currently, the northbound loop-off ramp merges with University Avenue approximately 100
feet south of the intersection of University Avenue and Donohoe Street without any acceleration lane.
An alternative design concept that includes "squaring" the northbound loop off-ramp intersection with
University Avenue so that it would be controlled by the Donohoe Street signal, to enhance bicycle and
pedestrian safety was also analyzed.
The traffic operations analyses were performed under existing conditions as well as with forecast traffic
volumes. Future traffic operations were analyzed under the No Project scenario (No Build) and the scenario
with the proposed interchange improvement (Build alternative).

Intersections
In coordination with Caltrans, the following intersections were selected for analysis:
            1. US 101 NB Ramps and Donohoe Street,
            2. University Avenue and Donohoe Street,
            3. University Avenue and US 101 SB Ramps, and

            4. University Avenue and Woodland Avenue.
Note:- Because of the orientation of University Avenue and Donohoe Street in the study area, University
Avenue is referred to as a north/south roadway and Donohoe Street as an east/west roadway throughout this
report.
The proposed interchange improvements were analyzed using Synchro/SimTraffic (Version 8) software
developed by Trafficware.
Traffic operations analyses were conducted for the following scenarios:
Existing Conditions Analysis – A representation of the existing roadway network was prepared using
Synchro. The Synchro model was calibrated to existing conditions based on existing AM and PM peak hour
traffic volumes, existing lane geometries, existing signal timings/phasings and observed peak hour vehicular
queues.
Year 2040 No Project Conditions – Year 2040 no project conditions were analyzed using existing lane
configurations at the study intersections and using the Year 2040 AM and PM peak hour volumes. Year 2040
traffic forecasts were obtained from the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). These forecasts
were used in conjunction with the existing intersection counts to develop intersection turning movement
forecasts for all study intersections.
Year 2040 Plus Project Conditions – The project conditions refer to the proposed roadway improvements at
the US 101/University Avenue interchange. The proposed improvements include widening the US 101
southbound loop off-ramp to include dual left-turn lanes and dual-right turn lanes and reconfiguring the US
101 northbound loop-off ramp to bring it closer to the intersection of University Avenue and Donohoe Street to
enhance bicycle and pedestrian safety. Year 2040 plus project conditions were analyzed using Year 2040
intersection turning movements with the proposed US 101/University Avenue interchange improvements. The
2040 traffic forecasts are the same with or without the project because the improvements are not enough to
change the travel model network or to influence traffic patterns.
Project Opening Year Analysis – It is assumed that the proposed project would be completed by Year 2020.
The opening year analysis was conducted for the No Project Alternative and Plus Project Alternative. Year
2020 traffic volumes were interpolated based on existing counts and Year 2040 forecasts derived from the
model.
These scenarios are discussed in detail in the following sections of this report.

Existing Conditions
AM and PM peak hour field observations were conducted in January 2015. In general, during the AM peak
hour, southbound University Avenue and westbound Donohoe Street are heavily congested. During the PM
peak hour, northbound University Avenue and eastbound Donohoe Street (east of University Avenue) are
congested.
US 101 NB Ramp/Donohoe Street – This is an unsignalized intersection, where the westbound left-turns
should yield to the eastbound traffic. During the AM peak hour long queues develop in the westbound left-turn
lane. During the AM peak hour, there is a demand of 800 to 900 vehicles on the US 101 northbound on-ramp
from Donohoe Street and E. Bayshore Road. This ramp is metered during the AM peak hour, and
occasionally vehicular queues from the ramp meter extend all the way to Donohoe Street. Since the
westbound left-turning vehicles from Donohoe Street have to find gaps in the eastbound through traffic,
queues are developed in the westbound left-turn lane on Donohoe Street that extend past the upstream
intersection of University Avenue. Vehicles would frequently use the through lane adjacent to the left-turn lane
to merge into the left-turn lane blocking the westbound through traffic. Also, long queues exist in the
eastbound through lane. The long queues in the eastbound through lane develop because occasionally the
right-turning traffic onto the US 101 northbound ramp blocks the through traffic. Occasionally the eastbound
through traffic could not enter the intersection because of downstream queuing in the eastbound right-turn
lane at the intersection of University Avenue and Donohoe Street that extends past the intersection of US 101
northbound ramp and Donohoe Street thus blocking the right-turn traffic.

During the PM peak hour, no significant traffic related issues occur at this intersection. The westbound left-
turn traffic queue is contained within the left-turn lane and does not block the through traffic. The westbound
left-turning traffic onto the US 101 northbound ramp can easily find gaps in the eastbound through traffic.
During the PM peak hour, there is no ramp metering at the US 101 northbound ramps and as such there are
no long queues on the ramp.
University Avenue/Donohoe Street– This is a signalized intersection that operates with split phasing for the
eastbound and westbound approaches with a cycle length of 140 seconds during both the AM and PM peak
hours. During the AM peak hour, long queues occur on southbound University Avenue that extend to Bell
Street. Long queues also occur in the eastbound right-turn lane and in the westbound inner through lane,
which is a trap lane for the downstream left-turn lane onto the US 101 northbound ramp. Although there is a
“Do Not Block Intersection” sign posted on all approaches at this intersection, vehicles occasionally block the
intersection as a result of queuing on downstream Donohoe Street to access the US 101 northbound ramp.
Vehicles that block the intersection conflict with pedestrians during the ped-crossing phase of the west leg.
During the PM peak hour, the peak direction of traffic is northbound University Avenue. Vehicular queues on
northbound University Avenue ocassionally extend back to the upstream intersection of University Avenue
and US 101 southbound ramps.
University Avenue/US 101 SB Ramps – This intersection currently operates in close coordination with the
intersection of University Avenue and Woodland Avenue with a cycle length of 120 seconds in the AM and
PM peak hours. During the AM peak hour this intersection operates without any significant traffic related
issues. Occasionally, long queues develop in the southbound left-turn lane towards the US 101 southbound
on-ramp that spill into the inner through lane on University Avenue. However, most of the time, these queues
are able to clear in one signal cycle length.
During the PM peak hour, vehicular queues on northbound University Avenue extend past the upstream
intersection of Woodland Avenue. Vehicular queues on the US 101 southbound off-ramp are able to clear in
one signal cycle.
University Avenue/Woodland Avenue - This intersection currently operates in close coordination with the
intersection of University Avenue and US 101 southbound ramps with a cycle length of 120 seconds in the
AM and PM peak hours. The eastbound and westbound approaches on Woodland Avenue operate with split
phasing. During the AM peak hour this intersection operates without any significant traffic related issues.
Occasionally the southbound traffic on University Avenue extends upstream up to the intersection of the US
101 southbound ramps.
During the PM peak hour, long vehicular queues occur on northbound University Avenue that extend all the
way back to the upstream intersection of Lincoln Avenue.

Existing Conditions Calibration
A representation of the existing roadway network was prepared using Synchro/SimTraffic (Version 8) software
developed by Trafficware. The study area included the following intersections:

               US 101 NB Ramps and Donohoe Street

               University Avenue and Donohoe Street

               University Avenue and US 101 SB Ramps

               University Avenue and Woodland Avenue
In addition, the intersection of University Avenue and Bell Street was coded in the network in order to include
the queues on the University Avenue north approach (University Avenue between Donohoe Street and Bell
Street) in the evaluation of traffic operations. Existing AM and PM peak hour volumes for the University
Avenue and Bell Street intersection were based on a 2012 count that was conducted for a previous traffic
study. The count was adjusted to reflect growth in traffic based on the new counts at the University Avenue &
Donohoe Street intersection. Traffic operations were analyzed for a two hour duration during the morning
peak (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and a two hour duration during the evening peak (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) in order to

                                                                                                     Page |3

capture the total demand rather than only the demand served at the intersections. A seeding time of 45
minutes was assumed for each evaluation run so that the demand was taken into account before recording
the runs for 2 hours. The existing network was calibrated to represent existing conditions based on existing
AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes, existing lane geometries, existing signal timing/phasing and observed
peak hour vehicular queues. The exising AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections are
shown on Figure 1. At least 10 simulation runs were conducted for each scenario using SimTraffic. Table 1
below shows a comparison of input volume versus the served volume based on the SimTraffic performance
report. As shown in Table 1, at all four study intersections the volume served is 97% or higher during both the
AM and PM peak hour existing conditions. Also shown in the table is the Geoffrey E. Havers (GEH) statistic.
The GEH Statistic is a formula used in traffic engineering and traffic modeling to compare two sets of traffic
volumes. The input volume is compared against the served volume in the simulation model. A GEH value of
less than 5.0 is considered a good match between the input volume and volume served. As shown in Table 1,
the GEH statistic for all four intersections was calculated to be less than 2.0 indicating that the volume served
at each intersection matched closely to the turning movement counts collected in the field.

In order to further validate existing conditions, the average queues on all approaches at each intersection
were analyzed. In general, at all study intersections, the average queues based on the existing conditions
Simtraffic model were found to match closely with the queues that were observed in the field.
Table 2 below shows the weighted average intersection delays at all four study intersections based on
SimTraffic reports and also the delay based on HCM 2000 Methodology.
Based on the microscopic simulation model, the intersection of US 101 northbound ramp and Donohoe Street
currently operates at LOS D during the AM peak hour and at LOS A during the PM peak hour period. The
intersection of University Avenue and Donohoe Street currently operates at LOS F during the AM peak hour
and LOS D during the PM peak hour. The poor LOS during the AM peak hour is attributed to the long
vehicular queues on southbound University Avenue and westbound Donohoe Street. The intersection of
University Avenue and US 101 southbound ramps currently operates at LOS D during the AM peak hour and
LOS C during the PM peak hour. The intersection of University Avenue and Woodland Avenue currently
operates at LOS D during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour. The poor LOS during the
PM peak hour is attributed to the long vehicular queues on northbound University, along with traffic on
Woodland Avenue heading towards northbound University Avenue.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
Project conditions refer to the following improvements at the interchange:
US 101 Northbound Off-ramp: The improvement is to reconfigure the US 101 northbound loop off-ramp to
provide, an acceleration lane approximately 200 feet in length to southbound University Avenue. This would
allow vehicular traffic coming from the northbound off-ramp to accelerate and merge onto southbound
University Avenue and would provide much better visibility for vehicles to see and yield to pedestrians and
bicycles. Currently, the northbound off-ramp merges at a 30 degree angle approximately 75 feet south of the
Donohoe Street/University Avenue intersection with no acceleration lane.
Because this realigned ramp is a very subtle change to vehicular operations, it does not produce a change in
the Simtraffic model. However, we believe that the realignment of the northbound off-ramp would allow
vehicles coming from the US 101 northbound loop-off ramp to accelerate before merging onto southbound
University Avenue. This would potentially reduce queuing on the northbound loop-off ramp.
US 101 Southbound Off-Ramp: The improvement consists of adding a fourth lane to the off-ramp as it
approaches University Avenue such that there would be dual left turn lanes and dual right turn lanes at the
intersection. Currently, the southbound off-ramp includes a left-turn lane, a shared left-right lane and a
separate right turn lane. This improvement was evaluated under existing and future traffic volume conditions.
The project improvements are shown on Figure 2.
The proposed improvements were coded on top of the calibrated existing conditions AM and PM peak hour
models and the traffic operations were analyzed using SimTraffic. The Simtraffic model was not able to show
any significant changes in traffic operations within the system with the improvements. The improvements only
affect the University Avenue/US 101 southbound off-ramp intersection, and this intersection is not really
experiencing any problems under existing conditions.

The intersection delay was analyzed using Synchro based on HCM 2000 methodology. Table 3 below
shows a comparison of existing and existing plus project AM and PM peak hour weighted average delay and
LOS at the US101 Southbound off-ramp intersection, which is the only intersection that would be affected by

VTA provided traffic volume plots derived from their year 2040 travel demand model. The model plots
displayed 4-hour morning and afternoon peak period volumes. Hexagon derived AM and PM peak-hour
volumes from the plots using factors derived from the Palo Alto General Plan Study. The AM and PM peak

Alternative Design Concept
An alternative design concept that includes "squaring" the northbound loop off-ramp intersection with
University Avenue so that it would be controlled by the Donohoe Street signal, to enhance bicycle and
pedestrian safety was also analyzed with existing traffic volumes. With this design, by having the vehicles
from the US 101 northbound loop-off ramp controlled by the signal at University Avenue and Donohoe Street,
it was found that the traffic operations at the University Avenue/Donohoe Street intersection would further
degrade, especially during the AM peak hour period. This would result in long vehicular queues on the off-
ramp, extending onto the US 101 freeway mainline. Therefore this design concept was rejected and no further
analysis was conducted.

Conclusions
Based on the traffic operations analysis presented in this report, the improvement at the intersection of
University Avenue/US 101 southbound off-ramp intersection which includes dual left-turn lanes and dual right-
turn lanes would result in a slight improvement in traffic operations in the study area. Although the
improvements proposed for the northbound US 101 off-ramp, which include reconfiguring the northbound loop
off-ramp to provide an acceleration lane could not be effectively evaluated with the Synchro/Simtraffic
