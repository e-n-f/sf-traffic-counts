Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Rocketship
School at 1700 Cavallo Road in Antioch, California. The proposed project would replace the existing
building with a new 24,357-square foot K-5 charter elementary school with an enrollment of 600
students and 32 full-time staff. Access to the project site would be provided via three on-site driveways,
one with full-access and two with partial-access (entry-only and exit-only), as well as a one-way access
easement through the adjacent County parcel.

This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the City of Antioch and the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA), which
serves as the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for Contra Costa County. A County Congestion
Management Program (CMP) analysis was not required because none of the study intersections are
part of the CMP network. However, many of the study area roadways are considered routes of regional
significance. The suburban arterial routes within the study area were evaluated in accordance with the
East County Action Plan (ECAP). The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic
conditions for nine signalized intersections and two unsignalized intersection in the vicinity of the project
site.

Project Trip Generation
The trip generation rates for the proposed school are based on counts Hexagon Transportation
Consultants, Inc. conducted at existing Rocketship Schools in San Jose between 2012 and 2014. The
trip generation rates at Rocketship Schools in San Jose are significantly higher than the elementary
school trip rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition. The magnitude of traffic generated by the proposed school was estimated by multiplying the
observed Rocketship School trip generation rates by the proposed enrollment (600 students). Given
that the existing building on the site is currently vacant, no credits or reductions were assumed for the
trips generated from the previous use.

Based on the surveyed trip generation rates and an enrollment of 600 students, the project would
generate 1,650 daily trips, 578 trips (314 inbound and 264 outbound) during the AM peak hour, and 314
trips (128 inbound and 186 outbound) during the PM peak hour.

Project Impacts
The results of the intersection level of service analysis are shown in Table ES-1. The analysis
determined that under all scenarios with and without the project, when measured against the City of


                                                                                               Page | i

Antioch and ECAP level of service standards, all of the signalized study intersections are expected to
operate at acceptable levels (high-level LOS D or better). In addition, under all scenarios with and
without the project, the worst stop-controlled approaches at the unsignalized study intersections would
operate at LOS C or better during one or both peak hours, which complies with the City’s mid-level LOS
D standard for intersections not on a Route of Regional Significance. Therefore, the project would not
result in a significant impact on intersection levels of service.
Other Transportation Issues
According to the 2013 Contra Costa County CMP Technical Procedures, the proposed project would
not have an adverse effect on the existing transit, pedestrian, or bicycle facilities in the study area.

Based on a review of the project site plan, Hexagon has provided the following recommendations to
improve site access, and on-site circulation.
Recommendations
      The northern parking lot should be reserved for staff parking only, given that there is not
       sufficient space at the end of the aisle for vehicles to turn around if the lot is full.

      The four 90-degree tandem spaces within the northern parking lot should be converted to
       standard 90-degree spaces with two spaces accessed via the adjacent county parcel and two
       spaces accessed via the project driveway.

      During student unloading/loading periods, school staff or volunteers should direct traffic and
       place cones in the drive aisles while students unload/load. After all students have cleared the
       loading zone, staff should remove the cones and allow traffic to move again so that the next 10
       vehicles can enter the loading zone. Staff members or parent volunteers should be stationed
       along the length of the student loading zone to assist students in and out of vehicles and ensure
       they safely walk to the school. Staff or volunteers should also ensure that parents do not leave
       their vehicles unattended in the loading zone while they visit the school and direct parents to
       unload/load students in a timely manner and then exit the loading zone. Parents that need
       additional time, for example to complete a phone call or to communicate with students before
       leaving the site should be directed to park in the designated on-site parking spaces to ensure
       the loading zone is available for its intended purpose.

      During the student unloading/loading periods, the entry-only driveway at the southern on-site
       parking lot should be monitored by staff or volunteers to prevent parents from using the parking
       area as a student unloading/loading zone and to avoid conflicts with vehicles exiting the
       designated student loading/unloading zone. Staff and/or traffic cones should be positioned
       adjacent to the exit gate at the end of the student loading/unloading zone to instruct vehicles to
       merge into one lane and direct traffic flow toward the exit-only driveway.

      At the Cavallo Road/East 18th Street intersection, the additional trips added by the proposed
       Rocketship School would increase the eastbound 95th percentile left-turn queue by 75 feet and
       50 feet, or three vehicles and two vehicles, during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The
       increase in queue length would exceed the existing turn pocket storage, possibly causing some
       left-turn vehicles to queue in the adjacent through lane while waiting to enter the left-turn pocket.
       Because East 18th Street has two through lanes in each direction, through traffic could continue
       to proceed in the curb lane if the inner through lane is blocked by left-turn traffic. The queue
       spillover would have an insignificant effect on traffic operations at this intersection because the
       spillover would occur for only a few seconds during only some signal cycles during the peak
       hours before and after school, and the left-turn queue is expected to completely dissipate during

                                                                                             Page | ii
Antioch Rocketship School – Transportation Impact Analysis                              August 1, 2017

       each signal cycle. Furthermore, the intersection would continue to operate at LOS C even if
       eastbound through traffic were reduced to the use of a single lane for the entire hour.
       Nevertheless, median striping modifications are recommended to encourage eastbound left-turn
       queues to extend into the center turn lane if necessary. The modification would remove the left-
       turn pocket taper striping to increase the queue storage available for use by eastbound left-turn
       traffic while still accommodating the existing left turns to and from adjacent driveways and
       Woodland Drive.

Antioch Rocketship School – Transportation Impact Analysis                                August 1, 2017




1. Introduction
This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed
Rocketship School at 1700 Cavallo Road in Antioch, California. The project site is located on the west
side of Cavallo Road just north of East 18th Street. The existing building on the project site contains
approximately 24,900 square feet and is currently vacant. The proposed project would replace the
existing building with a new 24,357-square foot K-5 charter elementary school with an enrollment of
600 students and 32 full-time staff. Access to the project site would be provided via three on-site
driveways, one full-access and two partial-access (entry-only and exit-only), as well as a one-way
access easement through the adjacent County parcel. The project site and the surrounding study area
are shown on Figure 1. The proposed site plan is shown on Figure 2.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the City of Antioch and the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA), which
serves as the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for Contra Costa County. A County Congestion
Management Program (CMP) analysis is not required because none of the study intersections are part
of the CMP network. However, many of the study area roadways are considered routes of regional
significance. The suburban arterial routes within the study area were evaluated in accordance with the
East County Action Plan (ECAP). The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic
conditions for nine signalized intersections and two unsignalized intersections in the vicinity of the
project site. The analysis focuses on the peak commute periods from 7-9 AM and from 4-6 PM given
that classes are primarily held between 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM and because it is during these hours that
traffic conditions on the surrounding roadways are generally the most congested. The study also
includes an analysis of student drop-off/pick-up circulation, and transit, bicycle, and pedestrian access.

Per CCTA’s Technical Procedures, a freeway segment level of service analysis is required when a
project adds 50 trips or greater to a freeway segment. Because the proposed project is expected to
generate less than 50 trips on any freeway segment, freeway segments were not evaluated.
Analysis Time Periods
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak commute
hours of traffic. Rocketship School activities would occur between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM, with classes
held between 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Thursdays,
school start time would remain the same but dismissal would occur earlier at 2:15 PM, in order for
teachers to have time for professional development after the students leave. On all school days, the
morning student drop-off period would occur between 7:00 AM and 7:45 AM for all grades, while the
afternoon pick-up periods would occur between 3:45 PM and 3:55 PM for TK and Kindergarten,
between 4:00 PM and 4:10 PM for grades 1 and 2, and between 4:10 PM to 4:20 PM for grades 3, 4,
and 5. Student pick-up for students in after-school programs would occur between 5:50 PM and 6:05
PM.

The peak hour of school traffic in the morning would coincide with the AM peak hour of commute traffic
(generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM). The peak hour of school traffic in the afternoon would coincide
with the PM peak hour of commute traffic (typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM). In addition, trips
associated with after school programming would be added to the PM peak commute hour. It is during
these peak commute periods that traffic is busiest and the impact on the roadway system by traffic from
the school would be greatest.
Analysis Scenarios
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
    Scenario 1: Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes at study intersections were based on traffic
                counts conducted in April 2017. The study intersections were evaluated with a level of
                service analysis using Synchro software in accordance with the 2010 Highway
                Capacity Manual methodology1.

    Scenario 2: Existing plus Project Conditions. Existing traffic volumes with the project were
                estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                project. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                order to determine the effects the project would have on the existing roadway network.

    Scenario 3: Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative traffic volumes represent traffic growth through the
                year 2040. Cumulative traffic volumes were estimated based on the available year
                2040 forecasts from the CCTA travel demand forecast model.

    Scenario 4: Cumulative plus Project Conditions. Cumulative plus project conditions were estimated
                by adding to the cumulative traffic volumes the additional traffic estimated to be
                generated by the proposed project. Cumulative plus project conditions were evaluated
                relative to cumulative conditions to determine potential project impacts.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.
Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, previous traffic studies,
CCTA, and field observations. The following data were collected from these sources:

       Existing traffic volumes,
       Existing lane configurations,
       Signal timing and phasing, and
       Year 2040 traffic volumes from the CCTA travel demand forecast model.
Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of
Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions
with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis
methods are described below.
Signalized Intersections
The City of Antioch evaluates level of service at signalized intersections based on the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) level of service methodology using Synchro software2. The 2010 HCM method
evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time for all vehicles
at the intersection. The City of Antioch level of service standard for signalized study intersections is
mid-level LOS D or better (average delay of 50 seconds or less), except on routes of regional
significance, where the standard is high-level LOS D or better (average delay of 55 seconds or less).
Wilbur Avenue, West 10th Street, and East 18th Street are all routes of regional significance. Thus, all of
the signalized study intersections are subject to the high-level LOS D standard.

According to the East County Action Plan (ECAP), the multi-modal transportation service objective
(MTSO) for suburban arterial routes is to maintain LOS D or better (average delay of 55 seconds or
less) at all signalized intersections. The correlation between average control delay and level of service
is shown in Table 1.

Unsignalized Intersections
Level of service at the unsignalized study intersections was based on the 2010 Highway Capacity
Manual (2010 HCM) method using the Synchro software. This method is applicable for both two-way
and all-way stop-controlled intersections. The two unsignalized study intersections have stop control on
the minor street (East 13th Street) and no control on the major street (“A” Street and Cavallo Road). The
levels of service reported for these intersections are based on the average delay of the worst stop-
controlled approach. The unsignalized study intersections are not on a Route of Regional Significance,
and are therefore subject to the mid-level LOS D standard (average delay of 30 seconds or less). The
correlation between average control delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections is shown in Table 2.

Intersection Operations
For selected high-demand movements at key intersections, the estimated maximum vehicle queues
were compared to the existing or planned storage capacity. The queuing analysis is presented for
informational purposes only, since neither the City of Antioch nor the CMP have defined any policies
related to queuing. Vehicle queues were calculated using a Poisson probability distribution, which
estimates the probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

         P (x n)    n e – ()
                            n!
Where:
         P (x n)  probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n  number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
             per hour)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the
95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25
feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement.

Significance Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. Impacts on signalized
intersections are based on the significance criteria and level of service standards of the jurisdiction in
which the intersection is located. For this analysis, significance criteria for impacts on signalized


                                                                                              Page | 7
Antioch Rocketship School – Transportation Impact Analysis                                  August 1, 2017


intersections are based on the City of Antioch and the ECAP level of service standards. As mentioned
in the previous section, the City of Antioch and the ECAP level of service standard for intersections on
routes of regional significance, is high-level LOS D or better (average delay of 55 seconds or less for
signalized intersections and 35 seconds or less for unsignalized intersections). Intersections that are
not on a route of regional significance are subject to the City’s mid-level LOS D standard (average
delay of 50 seconds or less for signalized intersections and 30 seconds or less for unsignalized
intersections).

According to the City of Antioch, a development is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic
conditions at a study intersection if for either peak hour, any of the following conditions occurs:

    1. The level of service at a signalized intersection on a route of regional significance degrades
        from an acceptable level (high-level LOS D or better with an average delay of 55 seconds or
        less) under no-project conditions to an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) under project
        conditions, or
    2. The project will add traffic to a signalized intersection on a route of regional significance that
        operates at an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) under no-project conditions, or
    3. The level of service at an unsignalized intersection that is not on a route of regional significance
        degrades from an acceptable level (mid-level LOS D or better with average delay of 30 seconds
        or less) under no-project conditions to an unacceptable level (high LOS D, or LOS E or F) under
        project conditions, and the intersection warrants a traffic signal based on the California Manual
        of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD) Peak-Hour Signal Warrant (Warrant 3).
A significant impact is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are implemented that would
restore intersection conditions to its level of service standard or to an average intersection delay that is
equal or better than no-project conditions.

2. Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for transportation facilities in the vicinity of the site,
including the roadway network, transit service, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via State Route 4 (SR 4).

SR 4 is an east/west freeway that extends from Hercules in Contra Costa County through San Joaquin,
Calaveras, and Alpine Counties. In Antioch, SR 4 was recently widened to eight lanes, including two
HOV lanes (one in each direction). SR 4 would provide access to and from the project site via
interchanges at “A” Street and Hillcrest Avenue.

Local access within the study area is provided on “A” Street, East 18th Street, Cavallo Road, West 9th
Street/Wilbur Avenue, West 10th Street/Beede Way, East 13th Street, Evergreen Avenue, and Hillcrest
Avenue. These roadways are described below.

“A” Street is a north/south arterial roadway that extends from SR 4 to West 3rd Street, where it
transitions into West 2nd Street. “A” Street is a designated route of regional significance south of East
18th Street. In the vicinity of the project site, “A” Street is a four-lane roadway with on-street parking.

East 18th Street is an east/west arterial roadway that extends from “L” Street to SR 160. East 18th
Street is a designated route of regional significance between “A” Street and SR 160. In the vicinity of
the project site, East 18th Street is a four-lane roadway with a center turn lane.

Cavallo Road is a north/south collector that extends from Wilbur Avenue south to East Tregallas Road,
where it transitions into Garrow Drive. In the vicinity of the project site, Cavallo Road is a three-lane
roadway with one lane in each direction of travel and a center turn lane. On-street parking and bike
lanes exist intermittently along both sides of the street. Cavallo Road runs along the eastern project
boundary and provides direct access to the Rocketship School site.

West 9th Street/Wilbur Avenue is an east/west arterial roadway that extends from “O” Street to the
eastern city limits east of SR 160. West 9th Street/Wilbur Avenue is a designated route of regional
significance west of SR 160. In the vicinity of the project site, Wilbur Avenue is a four-lane roadway
while West 9th Street is a two-lane roadway.

West 10th Street/Beede Way is an east/west arterial roadway that extends from Shady Lane to the
western city limits, where it transitions into Pittsburg-Antioch Highway. West 10th Street is a designated


                                                                                                 Page | 9
Antioch Rocketship School – Transportation Impact Analysis                                       August 1, 2017


route of regional significance. In the vicinity of the project site, West 10th Street/Beede Way is a two-
lane roadway with on-street parking.

East 13th Street is an east/west local collector that extends from “A” Street to Cavallo Road. East 13th
Street primarily serves the immediate residential neighborhoods surrounding the Kimball Elementary
School. East 13th Street is a two-lane roadway with on-street parking.

Evergreen Avenue is a two-lane north/south local street with on street parking on both sides. It
extends from East 18th Street south to Belshaw Street.

Hillcrest Avenue is primarily a four-lane north/south arterial roadway that extends from Prewett Ranch
Drive north to Jacobsen Street. Hillcrest Avenue is a designated route of regional significance south of
SR 4.

Existing Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist of sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals at signalized intersections.
In the project vicinity, sidewalks exist along both sides of “A” Street, East 18th Street, Cavallo Road,
West 9th Street/Wilbur Avenue, West 10th Street/Beede Way, East 13th Street, Evergreen Avenue, and
Hillcrest Avenue, providing pedestrian access to and from the project site. Marked crosswalks with
pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are provided at all approaches of the signalized study
intersections, except on the west leg of the East 18th Street Street/Evergreen Avenue intersection. At
the unsignalized study intersections, marked crosswalks are provided along all stop-controlled
approaches. Although one crosswalk connection is missing on East 18th Street at Evergreen Avenue,
the overall network of sidewalks and crosswalks in the study area has good connectivity and provides
students, parents, and staff with safe routes to the proposed school, nearby transit stops, and other
points of interest in the vicinity of the project site.

There are several bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the project site. The existing bicycle facilities within
the study area are described below, and are shown on Figure 3.

Class I Bikeway/Trail is an off-street path with exclusive right-of-way for non-motorized transportation
used for commuting as well as recreation. The Delta de Anza Regional Trail is a paved, multi-use trail
approximately two miles south of the project site that currently spans over 15 miles of the planned 25-
mile length. The trail generally follows the East Bay Municipal Utility District's corridor and the Contra
Costa Water District's canal, and once completed, will connect the Cities of Concord, Bay Point,
Pittsburg, Antioch, and Oakley as well as provide access to Contra Loma Regional Park. Access to the
Delta de Anza Regional Trail from the project site is provided via Hillcrest Avenue.

Class II Bike Lanes are preferential use areas within a roadway designated for bicycles. Within the
vicinity of the project, Class II bikeways are present along both sides Wilbur Avenue between “A” Street
and Wilbur Lane, Cavallo Road between Wilbur Avenue and East 18th Street, and Hillcrest Avenue
between East 18th Street and Prewett Ranch Drive. There is also a bike lane on one side of Lake Drive
and Hillcrest Avenue that facilitates bike travel in clockwise loop around Lake Alhambra.

Class III Bike Routes are signed bike routes that provide a connection through residential, downtown,
and rural/hillside areas to Class I and Class II facilities. Bike routes serve as transportation routes within
neighborhoods to parks, schools, and other community amenities. Although none of the residential
streets near the project site (e.g., East 13th Street, Noia Avenue, and East 14th Street) are designated
as bike routes, due to their low traffic volumes, many of them are conducive to bicycle usage.

Local Route 391 operates on Hillcrest Avenue in the vicinity of the project, and runs between the
Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station and the Brentwood Park & Ride lot. The closest stops are located at
the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and East 18th Street, which is about 0.6 miles from the project site.
Weekday service is provided from approximately 6 AM to 1 AM (next day), with 35- to-40-minute
headways during commute hours.

Local Route 392 operates on “A” Street in the vicinity of the project, and runs between the
Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station and the Antioch Park & Ride lot. The closest bus stops are located
on “A” Street at the East 13th Street and East 16th Street intersections, which are about one half-mile
from the project site. Service is provided only on weekends from approximately 5 AM to 2 AM (next
day) with about 60-minute headways.

Local Route 393 operates on Hillcrest Avenue in the vicinity of the project, and runs between Mariners
Cove/Pacifica and the Brentwood Park & Ride lot. The closest stops are located at the intersection of
Hillcrest Avenue and East 18th Street, which is about 0.6 miles from the project site. This route operates
on weekends only from approximately 5 AM to 2 AM (next day), with about 60-minute headways.

Local Route 394 operates east-west on Hillcrest Avenue in the vicinity of the project, and runs
between the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station and the Antioch Park & Ride lot. The closest stops are
located at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and East 18th Street, which is about 0.6 miles from the
project site. This route operates on weekends only from approximately 7 AM to 9 PM, with about 60-
minute headways.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the field
and are shown on Figure 5.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes at nine study intersections were obtained from peak-hour counts collected on
April 6th, 2017. AM peak-hour traffic volumes at two study intersections (“G” Street/10th Street and the
“G” Street/18th Street) are based on Spring 2016 counts conducted for the Antioch High School Street
Closure Traffic Study. However, the previous traffic analysis did not analyze the PM peak commute
hours from 4 to 6 PM. Therefore, new turning-movements counts were conducted at these intersections
in June 2017 and seasonally adjusted to reflect typical traffic volumes when Antioch schools are in
session. The existing peak-hour intersection volumes are shown in Figure 6. It should be noted that at
the intersection of “A” Street and East 13th Street, the traffic counts recorded vehicles illegally turning
left into the outbound-only driveway of the Higgins Chapel property. Intersection turning-movement
counts conducted for this analysis are presented in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against the City of Antioch and ECAP standards. The
results of the analysis show that all of the signalized study intersections currently operate at an
acceptable level of service (high-level LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours.

The stop-controlled East 13th Street approaches to “A” Street and Cavallo Road currently operate at
LOS B during both peak hours, which complies with the City’s mid-level LOS D standard for
intersections not on a Route of Regional Significance. The favorable level of service at the “A” Street
intersection can be attributed to the relatively low left-turn volumes and the four-lane cross section on
“A” Street. At the Cavallo Road intersection, a left-turn lane on northbound Cavallo Road allows turning
vehicles to wait for a gap in on-coming traffic without disrupting the flow of northbound through traffic.
Furthermore, the center turn lane in the median of Cavallo Road allows the left turn from eastbound
East 13th Street to northbound Cavallo Road to be completed in two stages. Vehicles can cross
southbound Cavallo Road and then stop in the center turn lane while waiting for a gap in the
northbound traffic flow.

Results of the intersection LOS analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 4. The
intersection levels of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to
confirm the accuracy of calculated intersection levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to
identify any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to
identify any locations where the level of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing traffic
conditions.

Overall, most study intersections operated adequately during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic,
and the level of service analysis appears to accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.
However, field observations showed that some operational problems currently occur during the PM
peak commute hour. These issues are described below.
“A” Street and East 18th Street
During the PM peak hour, congestion on northbound “A” Street extends to the upstream intersection of
Belshaw Street, causing vehicles to wait through at least two signal cycles to clear the intersection.
Queues in both the eastbound and westbound through lanes occasionally extend beyond the end of
their respective left-turn pocket, causing minor delays for vehicles trying to turn access the left-turn
pockets. However, the signal’s split phase allows all vehicles on these approaches to clear within one
signal cycle. During the AM peak hour, there were no observed operational issues.

3. Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes traffic conditions with the project. It begins with a description of the
transportation system under existing plus project conditions and the method by which project traffic is
estimated. A summary of levels of service under existing plus project traffic conditions is presented in
this chapter. Existing plus project conditions are represented by existing traffic conditions with the
addition of traffic generated by the project.

Transportation Network under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions
would be the same as the existing transportation network.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear were estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic traveling to and from the
project was estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, the
directions to and from which the project trips would travel were estimated. In the project trip
assignment, the project trips were assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures are
described below.
Trip Generation
The trip generation rates for the proposed school are based on counts Hexagon Transportation
Consultants, Inc. conducted at existing Rocketship Schools in San Jose between 2012 and 2014. All of
the surveyed schools have similar enrollment size and school hours as the proposed new Rocketship
school in Antioch. The observed trip generation rates are presented in Table 5. The trip generation
rates at Rocketship Schools in San Jose are significantly higher than the elementary school trip rates
published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. The
magnitude of traffic generated by the proposed school was estimated by multiplying the observed
Rocketship School trip generation rates by the proposed enrollment (600 students). Given that the
existing building on the site is currently vacant, no credits or reductions were assumed for the trips
generated from the previous use.

The proposed Rocketship school will implement a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Program that will encourage students and employees to carpool, take transit, or use active modes of
transport to get to and from school. Proposed TDM measures include carpool matching, financial
incentives for parents who carpool, and a ride-share allowance for staff members who live within two

miles of the project site. The TDM program is expected to reduce the vehicle trips and parking demand
generated by the proposed school compared to that observed at other Rocketship schools in San Jose,
which do not have similar TDM programs. To be conservative, this report assumes no trip reductions
for TDM measures. It should also be noted that while the trips generated by the proposed school would
be new to the roadways immediately adjacent to the project site, in a regional context, the Rocketship
school trips would be merely reassigned trips from other schools in the area where the students would
have otherwise attended. However, to be conservative, project trips were added to the roadway
network without reassigning existing vehicle trips associated with the nearby elementary schools (i.e.
Kimball Elementary School, Fremont Elementary School, Belshaw Elementary School).

surrounding roadway network and the school’s anticipated attendance area. It is anticipated that

Rocketship will draw some students from other public elementary schools in the vicinity including
Kimball Elementary School, Fremont Elementary School, and Belshaw Elementary School. However,
as previously stated, the traffic analysis is conservative in that Rocketship trips were merely added to
existing traffic volumes without any reassignment of existing elementary school trips. The trip
distribution pattern for the project is shown on Figure 7. Project trips were assigned based on the
directions of approach and departure, as well as the roadway network connections in accordance with
the project trip distribution pattern. The project trip assignment at each study intersection is shown
graphically on Figure 8.

Notes
1
    Peak hour trip rates (per student) based on Hexagon Transportation Consultants surveys conducted in 2012 through 2014 at five
    Rocketship elementary schools in San Jose.
2
    PM peak hour trip generation reflects 4 PM - 5 PM, which is when peak project traffic and peak background traffic overlap.
3
    Daily trip rate was derived by multiplying the AM peak hour rate by the ratio of daily trip rate to the AM trip rate (1.29/.45) available in
    the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition for Elementary School (ITE Land Use #520).



Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips, as represented in the above project trip assignment, were added to existing traffic
volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated
relative to existing conditions in order to determine potential project impacts. The existing plus project
traffic volumes are shown on Figure 9. A tabular summary of project traffic at each study intersection is
contained in Appendix B.

Existing Plus Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are
summarized in Table 7. The results show that all of the signalized study intersections would continue to
operate at acceptable levels of service (high-level LOS D or better).

The worst stop-controlled approaches at both unsignalized study intersections would operate at LOS C
or better under existing plus project conditions during both peak hours, which complies with the City’s
mid-level LOS D standard for intersections not on a route of regional significance.

4. Cumulative Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under cumulative conditions
with the proposed project. Cumulative conditions represent future traffic conditions with expected
growth in the area. Cumulative traffic volumes were estimated using forecasts developed from Contra
Costa County’s travel demand forecast model. Cumulative conditions reflect a horizon year of 2040.

Roadway Network and Traffic Volumes
The intersection lane configurations under cumulative conditions were assumed to be the same as
described under existing conditions.

Cumulative volumes at the study intersections were estimated based on year 2040 traffic volumes from
the County’s travel demand forecast model. The County’s travel demand forecast model assumes the
completion of the upcoming East Contra Costa Bay Area Rapid Transit (eBART) extension, which will
add 10 miles of eBART track from the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station to a new Antioch station at
Hillcrest Avenue. As a result, the travel demand forecast model assumes a shift in mode choice within
the Pittsburg/Antioch areas. Trips that currently use arterials streets or SR 4 are expected to access the
Hillcrest Avenue eBART station. This shift in mode choice is reflected in the decrease of traffic volumes
on selected study area roadways, particularly along “A” Street and West 10th Street/Wilbur Avenue. To
be conservative, for the intersection approaches where the model estimates traffic volumes to be lower
than the existing traffic count, traffic volumes for that approach were assumed to remain the same as
under existing conditions.

Cumulative plus project traffic volumes were estimated by adding to the cumulative traffic volumes the
additional traffic estimated to be generated by the project. Cumulative plus project conditions were
evaluated relative to cumulative conditions to determine potential project impacts. Figures 10 and 11
show the intersection turning-movement volumes under cumulative conditions without and with the
project. A tabular summary of project traffic at each study intersection is contained in Appendix B.

Intersection Levels of Service Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under cumulative conditions are summarized in Table 8. The
results show that, when measured against the City of Antioch and ECAP level of service standards, all
of the signalized study intersections are expected to operate at an acceptable level (high-level LOS D
or better) both with and without the proposed project. The intersection level of service calculation
sheets are included in Appendix C.

The worst stop-controlled approaches at both unsignalized study intersections would operate at LOS C
or better under cumulative plus project conditions during one or both peak hours, which complies with
the City’s mid-level LOS D standard for intersections not on a route of regional significance.

5. Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents other transportation issues associated with the project. These transportation
issues include an analysis of:

      Site access and circulation
      Vehicle queuing
      Potential impacts to transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities

Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in
this chapter are based on professional judgement in accordance with the standards and methods
employed by the traffic engineering community.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
This section describes the site access, circulation, and parking for the proposed project. Site access
and on-site circulation were evaluated using commonly accepted traffic engineering principles. This
review is based on the project site plan labeled “Rocketship Antioch Site Plan” provided by Swift Lee
Office on January 17, 2017 (See Figure 2).
Project Driveway Operations
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site’s driveways with regard to the
following: traffic volume, delays, vehicle queues, geometric design, and corner sight distance. Vehicular
access to the project site would be provided via one full-access driveway and two one-way driveways
on Cavallo Road. In addition, the project will have access via the adjacent county parcel. During the
peak drop-off and pick-up periods before and after school, parents will enter the northern driveway on
the adjacent county parcel and circulate along the western edge of the property before exiting from the
one-way, exit-only driveway at the southeastern edge of the project site.
The full-access driveway would be located along the northeastern edge of the project site, and provide
access to the northern parking lot. The full-access driveway would have a width of 26 feet. The one-
way driveways would be located along the southeastern edge of the project site and provide access to
the southern parking lot and egress for vehicles exiting the student loading zone along the western
edge of the site. While the entry-only driveway would allow both right and left turns into the site, the
exit-only driveway would be restricted to right turns only. Because the traffic volumes on Cavallo Road
are moderate and the exit driveway will be restricted to right turns only, delay and queues for exiting
vehicles are expected to be minimal. An analysis of the inbound left-turn queue length is provided
below. The entry-only and exit-only driveway would have a width of 20 feet and 17 feet, respectively.
The City of Antioch requires a minimum of 15 feet for a one-way driveway, and 26 feet for a two-way
driveway. Therefore, the project would meet the City’s design standards for driveway widths.



                                                                                         Page | 30

Adequate sight distance should be provided at the project driveways. Adjacent to the project site, there
are no roadway curves, on-street parking, or landscaping features that obstruct the vision of exiting
drivers. The site plans do not show any landscaping features that would interfere with the sight distance
at any of the site driveways. In order to ensure the safety of the students, no objects should be placed
within the sight distance triangle that would obstruct the vision of exiting drivers.
On-Site Circulation
The on-site circulation was reviewed in accordance with the City of Antioch Zoning Code and generally
accepted traffic engineering standards. Generally, the proposed plan would provide vehicle traffic with
adequate connectivity through the parking areas. During school hours, when the gates to the outdoor
play area west of the school building will be closed, the northern parking lot would have a single two-
way dead-end drive aisle with 90-degree perpendicular parking spaces. The drive aisle width (26 feet)
provides sufficient space for vehicles to back out of the parking stalls. Because there is not sufficient
space at the end of the aisle for vehicles to turn around if the lot is full, it is recommended that these
parking spaces be reserved for staff parking only. There is four feet between the last parking space at
the end of the aisle and the gate, which will facilitate vehicle maneuvers in and out of these parking
spaces. The northern parking lot also includes 45-degree angled parking spaces adjacent to a 20-foot
drive aisle that would be accessed via the easement through the adjacent county parcel. The site plan
also shows four 90-degree tandem spaces within the northern parking lot. It is recommended that these
tandem spaces be converted to standard 90-degree spaces with two spaces accessed via the adjacent
county parcel and two spaces accessed via the two-way project driveway.

Vehicles traveling within the southern parking area would circulate in a counterclockwise manner from
the entrance-only driveway at the northern edge of the lot to the exit-only driveway at the southern edge
of the lot. The southern parking lot would provide 45-degree parking adjacent to one-way drive aisles
that range from 18 to 25 feet wide. The proposed aisle width meets the City's standards.

The project site also would provide 90-degree parking spaces near the southwest corner of the site
adjacent to the student loading zone. Gates will block access to these spaces during the school day,
thus they will be used only for overflow parking during events outside regular school hours.
Student Drop-off and Pick-up
Student unloading/loading and queue storage of vehicles waiting to drop-off/pick-up students will occur
in the one-way drive aisle along the western edge of the project site. During the peak periods before
and after school, parents will access the student loading/unloading zone via the northern driveway on
the adjacent county property. Parents will then proceed in a single lane west and then south through
the County parking lot before entering the project site via a gate near the basketball court at the
northwest corner of the project site. Within the project site, vehicles will be permitted to proceed in
either of two lanes along the western edge of the site (See Figure 12). The student loading zone would
begin adjacent to the covered lunch area and extend approximately 125 feet in length to the southern
exit gate adjacent to the trash enclosure. The student loading zone would allow up to five vehicles in
each lane to load simultaneously. School staff or volunteers should direct traffic and place cones in the
drive aisles while students unload/load. After all students have cleared the loading zone, staff should
remove the cones and allow traffic to move again so that the next 10 vehicles can enter the loading
zone. Staff members or parent volunteers should be stationed along the length of the student loading
zone to assist students in and out of vehicles and ensure they safely walk to the school. Staff or
volunteers should also ensure that parents do not leave their vehicles unattended in the loading zone
while they visit the school and direct parents to unload/load students in a timely manner and then exit
the loading zone. Parents that need additional time, for example to complete a phone call or to
communicate with students before leaving the site should be directed to park in the designated on-site
parking spaces to ensure the loading zone is available for its intended purpose.

Furthermore, during the peak student unloading/loading periods, the entry-only driveway at the
southern on-site parking lot should be monitored by staff or volunteers to prevent parents from using
the parking area as a student unloading/loading zone and to avoid conflicts with vehicles exiting the
designated student loading/unloading zone. Staff and/or traffic cones should be positioned adjacent to
the exit gate at the end of the student loading/unloading zone to instruct vehicles to merge into one lane
and direct traffic flow toward the exit-only driveway. There is approximately 175 feet of space for
vehicles to queue in the southern parking lot after exiting the loading zone while waiting to turn out onto
Cavallo Road. The queue storage space for outbound vehicle would be sufficient to prevent queues
from backing up into the student loading/unloading zone.

School drop-off and pick-up operations and resulting queues were observed at Rocketship Mateo
Sheedy Elementary and Rocketship Si Se Puede Academy in San Jose. The length of vehicle queues
at the project site was estimated based on our observations at these existing Rocketship schools. The
estimates take into account the projected enrollment (600 students) and the length of the student
loading zone (125 feet in each of two lanes). It is estimated that 525 feet of queuing space would be
needed for drop-off operations and 450 feet of queue storage would be needed for pick-up operations.
Longer queues were observed during the morning drop-off period than the afternoon pick-up period
because all grades start at the same time in the morning, whereas dismissal times in the afternoon vary
by grade level and some students remain on site to participate in after school programs. Including the
storage space within and upstream of the student loading/unloading zone and excluding the vehicle
stacking space downstream of the loading zone, the site plan shows that on-site queue storage usable
for drop-off and pick-up operations would total 650 feet. Thus, drop-off and pick-up queues during the
peak periods before and after school are expected to be contained within the project site and not
extend onto the County parcel. Nevertheless, approximately 450 of additional queue storage space is
available within the easement on the adjacent County property. Thus, queues associated with
Rocketship School would not extend on to Cavallo Road.
The drive aisles on the County site range from approximately 30 feet at the northern driveway to 21 feet
behind the County building. Given the drive aisle width on the County property and that vehicle queues
are not expected to extend beyond the project site, use of the access easement is not expected to
substantially affect on-site circulation within the County property.

Queuing Analysis
The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand movements at intersections.
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability
of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

         P (x=n) =      n e – (
                          n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
         per hour)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the
95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25


                                                                                           Page | 33
Antioch Rocketship School – Transportation Impact Analysis                                   August 1, 2017

feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement.

The following ten left-turn movements were examined as part of the queuing analysis for this project:

      Southbound and westbound left turn at “A” Street and West 9th Street/Wilbur Avenue
      Northbound left turn at Cavallo Road and Wilbur Avenue
      Northbound left turn at “A” Street and West 10th Street/Beede Way
      Northbound left turn at Cavallo Road and East 13th Street
      Westbound left-turn/through movement at “A” Street and East 18th Street
      Eastbound and southbound left turn at Cavallo Road and East 18th Street
      Northbound left-turn/through movement at Hillcrest Avenue and East 18th Street
      Northbound left turn at Cavallo Road and County Driveway

At the intersection of “A” Street and East 18th Street, the westbound left-turn movement consists of one
left-turn lane and one shared left-turn/through lane. Given that the left-turn and through movements are
combined in a shared lane, the queue analysis on this approach reflects both the left-turn and through
movements. Similarly, the queuing analysis on the northbound Hillcrest Avenue approach to East 18th
Street reflects both the left-turn and through movements as they share a travel lane. The estimated
queue lengths based on the Poisson numerical calculations show queuing deficiencies at two locations
(see Table 9).
“A” Street and West 10th Street/Beede Way
At the “A” Street and West 10th Street/Beede Way intersection, the 95th percentile queue for the
northbound left turn currently exceeds the existing turn pocket storage capacity by 60 feet, or two
vehicles during the AM peak hour, and by 10 feet (less than one vehicle) during the PM peak hour.
Field observations, however, did not show any instances where this queue exceeded the available
storage. Under cumulative conditions, the 95th percentile queue is expected to continue to exceed the
storage capacity by 60 feet and 10 feet during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. With the
additional trips added by the Rocketship School project, the 95th percentile queue would increase by
one vehicle during both peak hours. The small increase in queue length would have a negligible effect
on traffic operations at this intersection because the left-turn spillback would be expected to last for only
a few seconds during only one signal cycle in the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no improvements
are recommended.
Cavallo Road and East 18th Street
The eastbound left-turn pocket at the Cavallo Road and East 18th Street intersection currently provides
sufficient storage for the existing queues during both the AM and PM peak hours. With the additional
trips added by the Rocketship School project, the 95th percentile queue will increase by 75 feet and 50
feet, or three vehicles and two vehicles, during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The increase
in queue length would exceed the existing turn pocket storage, possibly causing some left-turn vehicles
to queue in the adjacent through lane while waiting to enter the left-turn pocket. Because East 18th
Street has two through lanes in each direction, through traffic could continue to proceed in the curb lane
if the inner through lane is blocked by left-turn traffic. The queue spillover would have an insignificant
effect on traffic operations at this intersection because the spillover would occur for only a few seconds
during only some signal cycles during the peak hours before and after school, and the left-turn queue is
expected to completely dissipate during each signal cycle. Furthermore, the intersection would
continue to operate at LOS C even if eastbound through traffic were reduced to the use of a single lane
for the entire hour. Nevertheless, median striping modifications are recommended to encourage
eastbound left-turn queues to extend into the center turn lane if necessary (see Figure 13). The


                                                                                             Page | 34
Antioch Rocketship School – Transportation Impact Analysis                               August 1, 2017

modification would remove the left-turn pocket taper striping to increase the queue storage available for
use by eastbound left-turn traffic while still accommodating the existing left turns to and from adjacent
driveways and Woodland Drive.
Hillcrest Avenue and East 18th Street
At the Hillcrest Avenue and East 18th Street intersection, the 95th percentile queue for the northbound
left-turn/through movements is expected to exceed the existing turn pocket storage capacity by 90 feet
during the PM peak hour under cumulative conditions. The additional trips added by the Rocketship
School project are not expected to increase the 95th percentile queue. Therefore, the project is not
required to implement improvements at this intersection.

The existing turn storage is expected to be sufficient to accommodate the 95th percentile queue length
for all other locations including the left-turn movement from northbound Cavallo Road into the adjacent
County property, which would be used by parents dropping off and picking up students during the peak
hours before and after school.

Transit, Pedestrian, and Bicycle Analysis
Transit in the study area is provided by Tri Delta Transit. The study area is served directly by eight local
bus routes, three of which provide service within a ½ mile of the project site: Local Route 380, Local
Route 387, and Local Route 388. Combined, these routes provide service between the Pittsburg/Bay
Point BART Station, Deer Valley Kaiser Medical Center, and the Tri Delta Transit Station (see Chapter
2 for detailed discussion). The 2015 U.S. Census reports that bus trips comprise approximately 7.5% of
the total commute mode share in the City of Antioch. Assuming the same mode split for the proposed
project, this would equate to 43 transit trips during the AM and 24 transit trips during the PM peak
commute hours. According to the Tri Delta Short Range Transit Plan, the capacity of their bus fleet
ranges between 44 and 56 seats per vehicle. With one or two bus trips in each direction on every route
during commute hours, and given that the estimated transit volume of riders would be dispersed among
the different routes, the project-generated riders would not exceed the carrying capacity of the existing
bus service near the project site.

Pedestrian facilities in the study area consist of sidewalks located on both sides of Cavallo Road and
other nearby neighborhood roadways (e.g., East 13th Street, Noia Avenue, East 14th Street) in the
vicinity of the project. Pedestrian travel to and from the project site is also aided by marked crosswalks
with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons at all but one approach at the signalized study
intersections, and marked crosswalks along all stop-controlled approaches at unsignalized study
intersections. Although one crosswalk connection is missing, the overall network of sidewalks and
crosswalks in the study area has good connectivity and provides pedestrians with safe routes to the
proposed school, nearby transit stops, and other points of interest in the vicinity of the project site.

Bicycle lanes are present on portions of Wilbur Avenue, on Cavallo Road, Hillcrest Avenue, and Lake
Drive. Although none of the adjacent residential streets have striped bike lanes, the low traffic volumes
make these roadways conducive to bicycle traffic. In addition, bikes and pedestrians could also use the
Delta de Anza Regional Trail, which connects to Hillcrest Avenue. The sidewalks and bikeways in the
school vicinity are adequate to serve students who may walk or bike to school.

6. Conclusions
The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the
City of Antioch, Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) Congestion Management Program
(CMP), and the East County Action Plan (ECAP). The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM
peak hour traffic conditions for nine signalized intersections and two unsignalized intersection in the
vicinity of the project site. The analysis focuses on the peak commute periods between 7:00 and 9:00
AM and between 4:00 and 6:00 PM, because it is during these hours that traffic conditions on the
surrounding roadways are generally the most congested.

Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The analysis determined that under all scenarios with and without the project, when measured against
the City of Antioch and ECAP level of service standards, all of the study intersections are expected to
operate at acceptable levels (high-level LOS D or better). In addition, under all scenarios with and
without the project, the worst stop-controlled approaches at the unsignalized study intersections would
operate at LOS C or better during one or both peak hours, which complies with the City’s mid-level LOS
D standard for intersections not on a route of regional significance. Therefore, the project would not
result in a significant impact on intersection levels of service.

Other Transportation Issues
According to the 2013 Contra Costa County CMP Technical Procedures, the proposed project would
not have an adverse effect on the existing transit, pedestrian, or bicycle facilities in the study area.

Based on a review of the project site plan, Hexagon has provided the following recommendations to
improve site access, and on-site circulation.
Recommendations
      The northern parking lot should be reserved for staff parking only, given that there is not
       sufficient space at the end of the aisle for vehicles to turn around if the lot is full.

      The four 90-degree tandem spaces within the northern parking lot should be converted to
       standard 90-degree spaces with two spaces accessed via the adjacent county parcel and two
       spaces accessed via the project driveway.

      During student unloading/loading periods, school staff or volunteers should direct traffic and
       place cones in the drive aisles while students unload/load. After all students have cleared the
       loading zone, staff should remove the cones and allow traffic to move again so that the next 10


                                                                                           Page | 39

       vehicles can enter the loading zone. Staff members or parent volunteers should be stationed
       along the length of the student loading zone to assist students in and out of vehicles and ensure
       they safely walk to the school. Staff or volunteers should also ensure that parents do not leave
       their vehicles unattended in the loading zone while they visit the school and direct parents to
       unload/load students in a timely manner and then exit the loading zone. Parents that need
       additional time, for example to complete a phone call or to communicate with students before
       leaving the site should be directed to park in the designated on-site parking spaces to ensure
       the loading zone is available for its intended purpose.

      During the student unloading/loading periods, the entry-only driveway at the southern on-site
       parking lot should be monitored by staff or volunteers to prevent parents from using the parking
       area as a student unloading/loading zone and to avoid conflicts with vehicles exiting the
       designated student loading/unloading zone. Staff and/or traffic cones should be positioned
       adjacent to the exit gate at the end of the student loading/unloading zone to instruct vehicles to
       merge into one lane and direct traffic flow toward the exit-only driveway.

      At the Cavallo Road/East 18th Street intersection, the additional trips added by the proposed
       Rocketship School would increase the eastbound 95th percentile left-turn queue by 75 feet and
       50 feet, or three vehicles and two vehicles, during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The
       increase in queue length would exceed the existing turn pocket storage, possibly causing some
       left-turn vehicles to queue in the adjacent through lane while waiting to enter the left-turn pocket.
       Because East 18th Street has two through lanes in each direction, through traffic could continue
       to proceed in the curb lane if the inner through lane is blocked by left-turn traffic. The queue
       spillover would have an insignificant effect on traffic operations at this intersection because the
       spillover would occur for only a few seconds during only some signal cycles during the peak
       hours before and after school, and the left-turn queue is expected to completely dissipate during
       each signal cycle. Furthermore, the intersection would continue to operate at LOS C even if
       eastbound through traffic were reduced to the use of a single lane for the entire hour.
       Nevertheless, median striping modifications are recommended to encourage eastbound left-turn
       queues to extend into the center turn lane if necessary. The modification would remove the left-
       turn pocket taper striping to increase the queue storage available for use by eastbound left-turn
       traffic while still accommodating the existing left turns to and from adjacent driveways and
       Woodland Drive.
