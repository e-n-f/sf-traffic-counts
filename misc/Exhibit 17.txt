Subject:        Final Mercer Island Plat Site Access Analysis

This memorandum provides a summary of the forecast traffic-related impacts associated with the
proposed residential development located east of 78th Avenue SE and south of SE 72nd Street on
Mercer Island, Washington. A description of the proposed single-family home development is
provided below and is followed by sections that summarize background conditions within the
project vicinity, forecast project-generated traffic, analysis of the proposed site access at the 80th
Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street intersection, evaluation of parking and provide a summary of this
analysis. This study evaluated weekday AM and PM peak conditions.

Project Description
The proposed project is located east of 78th Avenue SE and south of SE 72nd Street in southwest
Mercer Island and includes development of 6 single-family homes. Figure 1 illustrates the project
site and surrounding vicinity. Figure 2 provides a preliminary site plan and as shown, vehicular
access would be provided via 80th Avenue SE north to SE 72nd Street. The project would also
improve the 80th Avenue SE private access and construct the east-west on-site roadway to
provide a 26-foot pavement section.

Background Conditions
Several roadways within the project vicinity provide access to the project site or are located
adjacent to the project site. 80th Avenue SE is a private access south of SE 72nd Street, is
located northeast of the site, and connects the site to the broader arterial street system. 80th
Avenue SE is a private ingress/egress with no designated parking. SE 72nd Street, located north
of the project site, is classified as a Collector Arterial with a speed limit of 30 mph, no bicycle
facilities, and sidewalks along both sides of the street. The 80th Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street
intersection operates as a two-way stop-controlled intersection.

Project Traffic
Vehicular traffic generated by the proposed project was forecast based on average trip generation
rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th
Edition). The estimated vehicular trip generation is summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, the proposed project is anticipated to generate a total of 58 weekday daily
trips with 5 occurring during the AM peak hour and 6 occurring during the PM peak hour. The City
of Mercer Island General Traffic Impact Analysis Requirement, July 2015 states that a traffic
impact analysis is required for proposed developments that generates 10 or more peak hour trips.
As described above, the proposed project generates 5 weekday AM peak hour trips and 6



                                                                                                                  2
weekday PM peak hour trips, which is less than the 10-trip threshold established by the City for
triggering traffic impact analyses. The scope of this study is based on coordination with City staff.

Project trips were distributed and assigned to the adjacent roadway network and site access
intersection based on existing observed traffic volumes and are illustrated in Figure 3.




                  Figure 3 – Weekday Peak Hour Project Trip Distribution & Assignment

As shown in Figure 3, 40 percent of project trips are distributed to the west along SE 72nd Street,
and 60 percent of project trips are distributed to the east along SE 72nd Street.


Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected at the 80th
Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street intersection in August 2016. A detailed data worksheet is provided in
Attachment A.

Future without-project traffic volumes were forecast by applying a 0.5 percent annual growth rate,
based on City of Mercer Island requirements. Although the project is anticipated to be constructed
and occupied by 2018, growing existing volumes does not result in volumes that are differ from
existing conditions.



                                                                                                        3
Forecast project trips were added to background traffic volumes to estimate future with-project
traffic volumes. Figure 4 illustrates the existing, forecast without-project, and forecast with-project
traffic volumes at the 80th Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street intersection.

Site Access Evaluation
The following sections summarize the traffic operations analysis at the site access intersection,
and review sight-distance at the existing site access intersection that will serve the proposed
project.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are evaluated by calculating the average delay
and associated level of service (LOS). Traffic operations were evaluated based on the procedures
identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (2010), and evaluated using Synchro version 9.1. At
side-street stop-controlled intersections such as the SE 72nd Street/80th Avenue SE intersection,
LOS and delay per vehicle are reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection.
Traffic operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of
service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme



                                                                                                          4
congestion and long vehicle delays. Attachment B contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria
and definitions. Detailed LOS/delay calculation worksheets are provided in Attachment C.

The proposed site access at the 80th Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street intersection is anticipated to
operate at LOS B with an average delay of 11 seconds per vehicle or less during either the
weekday AM or PM peak hours. These results demonstrate delays would be minimal in the vicinity
of the proposed project.

Sight Distance
Intersection and stopping sight distance were measured at the 80th Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street
site access intersection consistent with the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. With a 30 mile per hour (mph) posted speed limit,
the design speed along SE 72nd Street is 35 mph. Note that SE 72nd Street slopes approximately
11 percent downward west of the 80th Avenue SE intersection and is reflected in the identification
of required stopping sight-distance; major street grades do not affect intersection/entering sight-
distance values.

Stopping sight distance is the distance a driver needs to see in order to come to a complete stop
after recognizing an object in the roadway. Intersection sight distance is the distance a driver
needs to see in order to be able to identify an acceptable gap in major street traffic and enter
major street traffic without slowing oncoming vehicle speeds by more the approximately
15 percent. The sight distance requirements (based on AASHTO) and field measured sight
distances are shown in Table 2. Attachment D shows the stopping sight lines and intersection
sight distance triangles.

2. 217 feet required with adjustment for 11% (6 degree) grade.


As shown in Table 2, the measured stopping sight distance exceeds the requirements in both the
eastbound and westbound directions and demonstrates that vehicles can observe and come to a
stop before striking a roadway obstruction at the site access intersection. The measured
intersection sight distance east of the intersection also exceeds sight distance requirements;
however, west of the intersection the intersection sight distance is obstructed at 225 feet by a bank
of mailboxes and street trees along the south side of SE 72nd Street. Although this indicates that
drivers on SE 72nd Street may need to slow should vehicles pull out from 80th Avenue SE, drivers
on SE 72nd Street are provided enough site distance to stop if necessary. Attachment D shows
the stopping and intersection sight distance triangles.

Parking
The following provides an evaluation of the proposed project parking supply and anticipated
parking demand.

Supply
The City of Mercer Island Municipal Code Chapter 19.02 Residential outlines that for single-family
dwelling units in Zone R9.6 3 parking spaces are required per dwelling unit with at least 2 stalls



                                                                                                                           5
being covered. The proposed project would provide 3 covered stalls and would accommodate 3 to
4 vehicles within the driveways for typical parking conditions. This results in a total of 6 to 7
parking spaces per dwelling unit for typical parking conditions or a total of 36 to 42 parking spaces
for the proposed project. One additional vehicle could be accommodated within each driveway
under special circumstances where vehicles are parked closer together to accommodate
additional guests; this results in 7 to 8 parking spaces per dwelling unit for a total of 42 to 48
parking spaces for the proposed project. There is no existing or planned designated on-street
parking along the 80th Avenue SE. The existing residential uses are occasionally using 80th
Avenue SE for guest parking; however, this is not a permitted existing or future use. Under non-
typical circumstances, where additional parking is needed to accommodate guests, property
owners would need to coordinate with adjacent owners for parking.

Demand
Parking demand for the proposed single-family homes was reviewed based on available data
including the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Parking Generation, 4th Edition and
vehicle ownership data from the US Census Bureau American Community Survey for the census
tract in which the proposed project resides. Table 3 provides a summary of the estimated parking
demand for the proposed project based on the available data.

3. US Census Bureau 2011-2015 American Community Survey Census Tract 246.02 for owner occupied homes.


As shown in the table, the total parking demand for the proposed project ranges from 11 to 14
vehicles or approximately 2 to 3 vehicles per dwelling unit. The proposed project would have a
maximum of 7 to 8 parking spaces per dwelling unit, which would fully accommodate the
anticipated parking demand for the proposed project. There may be occasions where residents
entertain guests in their homes. The proposal would accommodate up to 15 to 16 people within
the home assuming 2 guests per vehicle; this would be considered a larger gathering and is not
anticipated under typical conditions.

80th Avenue SE On-Street Parking
80th Avenue SE is a private access providing ingress/egress providing access to 4 existing single-
family homes. Parking is not a designated use along this existing private access easement and all
existing homes have driveways. Traffic along this road is limited and occasionally the existing
residents use 80th Avenue SE informally for guest parking. With the proposed project, 80th
Avenue SE would be improved to 26-feet with no parking (consistent with existing conditions) per
the City's Fire Code requirements. It is not possible to provide parking along the easement and
meet the Fire Code requirements of a 26-foot width.

The existing residence have sufficient space within their garages and driveways to meet parking
requirements and do not need to use the easement area to meet typical parking needs. Under
non-typical circumstances, where additional parking is needed to accommodate guests, property




                                                                                                                                            6
owners would need to coordinate with adjacent owners for parking. This is consistent with current
conditions where parking is not a designated use along 80th Avenue SE.

Construction Parking
Parking would be provided on-site during construction and would not impact the existing trees to
be protected as part of the project.

Analysis Summary
    •   Traffic volumes in the site vicinity are low during peak periods and the propose project
        would result in an increase of less than 10 vehicles, which is below the threshold
        established by the City of Mercer Island for conducting traffic impact analyses.

    •   The site access at 80th Avenue SE/ SE 72nd Street is anticipated to operate at LOS B
        with minimal delay to drivers.

    •   With low traffic volumes, vehicle conflicts would be infrequent. Stopping sight-distance is
        provided at the existing site access road intersection and no adverse impacts are
        anticipated.

    •   Parking demand associated with the proposed project is anticipated to be fully
        accommodated within the proposed garages and driveways of each single-family home.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
