Project Description
1. Project Scope
   The project is a roadway reconﬁguration and streetscape project on N 21st Street between N
   Adams and N Pearl Streets. The project will include new sidewalks, ADA compliant curb
   ramps, bicycle facilities, new energy eﬃcient lighting, updated traﬃc signals, landscaping,
   and road rehabilitation with new concrete pavement and revised channelization. This grant
   application is for the preliminary design and right of way phases of the project.
2. Project Justiﬁcation, Need, or Purpose
   N 21st Street is one of the main arterials through the City of Tacoma, connecting downtown
   and the northern portion of the City. It serves regional commuter traﬃc generated from 3
   major areas: Downtown Tacoma and Major Medical Centers, University of Puget Sound, and
   Commercial Areas along N Proctor and N Pearl Streets. It is also an access route to State
   Route (SR) 16 with access via N Orchard and N Pearl Streets. For most of its length within the
   project area, N 21st Street is mostly surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The Westgate
   Business District is located adjacent to N 21st Street at N Pearl Street and the Proctor
   Business District can be accessed oﬀ of N21st Street by N Proctor Street.
   There are currently bike lanes and sidewalks on N 21st Street east of N Proctor Street that
   connect to the Downtown Regional Growth Center. The road conﬁguration of N 21st Street
   connect to the Downtown Regional Growth Center. The road conﬁguration of N 21st Street
   between N Adams and N Proctor Streets is two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane
   with bike lanes each direction (Picture 1). Starting at N Proctor Street heading west, N21st
   Street is currently a 4-lane arterial with a center median occupied by Tacoma Power
   transmission towers. The street does not have bike lanes and does not have continuous
   sidewalks and curb and gutter (Picture 2). As part of an electrical system upgrade, Tacoma
   Power is replacing their towers (Pictures 3,4) with new single power poles (Picture 5) which
   will allow the median to be eliminated except at pole locations. N 21st Street west of N Proctor
   Street will be reconﬁgured to include two travel lanes westbound and one travel lane
   eastbound, and a center turn lane. Bike lanes and sidewalks with ADA accessible curb ramps,
   the latter separated from the roadway by curb and gutter and planter strip, will be provided for
   the entire length of the project increasing non-motorized access and safety.
   The project will also upgrade/replace three traﬃc signals which will be interconnected with
   other signals in the vicinity. The addition of this feature will increase traﬃc ﬂow, manage traﬃc
   speed, and reduce vehicular idle time emissions. Energy eﬃcient (LED) street lights will be
   installed along the length of the project.
   The project will incorporate new trees in the planter strip between the curb line and sidewalk
   and new stormwater treatment techniques where feasible.

   with two travel lanes in the westbound direction and one travel lane in the eastbound
   direction. The attached cross section represents the ﬁrst option while the attached plan view
   reﬂects the second option. Both include bike lanes, new sidewalks, and new street lights.
   The second option is described in this application; however, the ﬁnal decision on the
   roadway conﬁguration will be made during Preliminary Engineering.

1. Introduction:

    1.1. Project Site Description
The N 21st St. between Pearl to Proctor is a two-lane east-west arterial roadway located at the
north quadrant of the City. It is one of the major northern east-west corridors which serve both
regional and local trips. Four (4)
signalized and Nineteen (19) un-
signalized intersections are located
between Pearl and Proctor. Three
(3) signalized intersections run
under a coordinated signal timing
plan and one (1) runs
independently. The 21st St. between                                                            
Pearl and Proctor is mostly               Figure 1: Project Vicinity Map
surrounded by residential
neighborhoods and common neighborhoods components such as parks, schools and small
retail shops. Sidewalks are located either on both sides or one side of the corridor between
Pearl and Proctor. A 12-24 FT raised median is located along this corridor, trees have been
planted in the median, and electric transmission towers are also located on the raised median.
See the Figure 1: Project Vicinity Map

    1.2. Problem Statement
The N 21st St. is a four-lane roadway with 2 lanes in each direction between Pearl and Proctor.
The electric transmission towers are located on the raised median (12-24 FT, varies along the
corridor). The existing electric transmission towers are planned to be removed, and replace by
underground service or by other possible means. Once the electric transmissions are removed
the 12-24 FT raised median will be available for multi-modal facilities to support non-motorized
traffic along N 21st St and for an
extention of the existing bicycle path
from west of Proctor to Pearl. The                                        3
objective of this project is to analyze
the impact on the key intersections
operations for the existing baseline
conditions, assess the different                                              2 
alternatives that will provide additional                                                  1
right-of-way for multipurpose
sidewalks within the existing roadway
right-of-way, and document any
negative impacts that may occur on
the intersection level of service (LOS),
queues.

          1.3. Function of N 21st St.
The N 21st St. is one of the main arterials through the City of Tacoma. It connects north-east
downtown and the northern part of the City. It is one of the primary corridors for both commuters
and local trips. It serves regional commuter traffic generated from 3 major areas (i.e. 1.
Downtown Tacoma & Major Medical Centers, 2. University of Puget Sound and, 3. Commercial
Area) within the City of Tacoma as identified in Figure 2: Function of N 21st St. It is a major
access to highway State Route (SR) 16, an important north-south highway that serves regional
traffic in the Pierce County. Commuter traffic traveling on N 21st St. can access to SR-16 via
Pearl and Orchard (See Figure 2: Function of N 21st St.). N Pearl St. is the most attractive route
for the commuter trips traveling on n 21st St. to access SR-16. The 21st St. between Pearl and
Proctor is mostly surrounded by residential neighborhoods and very little retail or commercial
activities. The absence of roadside conflicts and frictions on N 21st St and makes it a very
attractive route for both commuters and longer local trips. Commuter traffic traveling on N 21st
St. cannot access SR-16 via Proctor or Stevens.


2. Traffic Data Collection:
Three different types of traffic data were collected to assess the existing baseline conditions.

          2.1. 24 Hours Traffic Counts:
The 24 hours traffic count was conducted at three (3) different locations between Pearl and
Union to investigate the directional (east-west) traffic demand variations over a 24 hour time
period along N 21st St. See the Figure 3: Location Traffic Counts. Find the details in Appendix.

                                                              N 21st ST. – Pearl to Proctor TRAFFIC STUDY
                                                                                                             
    2.2. Peak Hour Traffic Counts:
Peak hour traffic counts were conducted for PM peak hour time period. The objective of the
traffic counts was to assess the peak hour traffic operational conditions. P.M. Peak hour was
considered for traffic analysis due to higher traffic volume. Find the details in Appendix.

    2.3. Lane Utilization
In addition to the peak hour traffic counts a limited hour (1/2 hour) traffic counts during the peak
period was conducted to estimate the eastbound and westbound lane utilization at 2 different
locations, 1. At west leg of the N Proctor St., 2. At east leg of the N Pearl St. for eastbound
traffic. The limited duration traffic counts were recorded by lane to estimate the lane utilization.
The objective of this count was to understand how existing traffic is distributed on the EB and
WB two lanes.


3. Scenario Development:
Two (2) different alternatives were developed and evaluated to identify the preferred solution
that will facilitate acceptable multi-modal traffic operation between Pearl and Proctor. The
recommendations from the “Tacoma Traffic Calming Simulation Study” for the N 21st St.
between Union and Proctor was (i.e. 2 through westbound lane and one eastbound lane
between Union and Proctor) were also considered while developing scenarios to ensure
consistency and continuity of the existing corridor lane configurations. The traffic operational
analysis was conducted for the 5 key intersections for these two scenarios, two (2) key
intersections (i.e. Union and Pearl) are located outside of the study area and three (3) key
intersections (Orchard, Steven and Proctor) are located within the project boundary. The two
outside intersections were considered to ensure acceptable traffic operation between Union and
Pearl, and no alternative was developed for these two outside key intersections. The existing
baseline conditions along with another alternative are described below:

    3.1. Scenario 1 – Existing/Baseline:
The N 21st St consists of 2 through lanes at Orchard and Steven and one eastbound through
lane and two westbound through lanes at Proctor. The cross street at these three (3)
intersections consist of 1 through lane and a left turn pocket. The 3 key intersection lane
configurations are shown in Figure 4 Scenario 1

       3.2. Scenario 2 – One Westbound (WB) Continuous through lane (CTL):
  This alternative would reduce EB-WB through lane to one through lane between west of Proctor
  and east of Winnifred St. This alternative would reduce the WB CTL (i.e. an approach through
  lane that runs continuous for at least one-half mile upstream and downstream of the intersection
  are called CTL) to one lane at Proctor. The N 21st St. would become a three-lane roadway with
  one EB and WB lane, and a TWLTL in the middle. The intersection lane configuration is shown
  in Figure 5: Scenario 2

  4. Traffic Operational Analysis:

       4.1. 24 Hours Traffic Analysis:
  24 hours traffic counts were conducted during three (3) weekdays at three different locations
  and the three days average traffic data is graphically represented for each location in Figure 6: 24 
  Hours Directional Traffic Counts. 2 traffic count locations were between Pearl and Proctor, the
  other was between Proctor and Union. The 3rd traffic data collection location was considered for
  two reasons, 1st,
  to understand the
  existing traffic
  demand between
  Proctor and
  Union, and 2nd to
  assess the
  potential impacts
  due to propose
  changes between
  Pearl and
  Proctor. The EB
  and WB averages
  weekday traffic
  were 4,744 and
  5,231
  respectively          Figure 6: 24 Hours Directional Traffic Counts

between Pearl and Proctor. In general WB lanes carry more traffic than EB lanes. Two peak
periods were identified using the 24 HR traffic counts, A.M. Peak Period and P.M. Peak Period.

A.M. Peak Period:
The A.M. peak period identified was from 6 A.M. to 10 A.M. when 27% of the EB traffic and 17%
of the WB traffic travel along N 21st St. between Pearl and Proctor. EB lanes carry
approximately 10% more traffic than WB lanes during the morning peak period.

P.M. Peak Period:
The P.M. peak period identified was from 3 P.M. to 7 P.M., when almost 38% of the WB traffic
and 29% of the EB traffic travel along N 21st St. between Pearl and Proctor. WB through traffic

was approximately 9% higher than EB through traffic during this peak period.

Vehicles speed and vehicle classifications data were also collected and the findings are
summarized below.

Speed:
The average 85th percentile speeds (i.e. the speed at or below which 85% of all vehicles were
observed to travel under free flowing conditions past a nominated point) for EB and WB were 38
mph and 36.7 mph respectively along N 21st St. between Pearl and Proctor. The posted speed
limit is 35 mph. The average 85th percentile speeds are little higher than posted speed limit for
the EB and WB which conforms to the general driver travel behavior. The observed 85th
percentile speeds for EB and WB were 39.1 mph and 37.4 mph respectively between Orchard
and Proctor, which is almost 3-4 mph higher than posted speed limit, and it demonstrates the
necessity of implementing traffic calming measures between Pearl and Proctor.

Vehicle Classification:
We observed that 1.25% and 3.7% for EB and WB respectively were heavy vehicles between
Pearl and Proctor. The WB lanes carry a little bit more heavy vehicles than EB lanes do.
However, the difference is insignificant and lane reduction on either direction will have almost
similar impacts.

The WB lanes serve more traffic during the afternoon peak period than EB lanes during the
morning perk period. Therefore, the WB through lane reduction will have a more detrimental
impact on the overall intersection traffic operation than the EB though lane reduction.

    4.2. Intersection Traffic Operational Analysis:
P.M. Peak hour Traffic operational analysis was conducted using SYNCHRO. The following is a
summary of the SYNCHRO output. Here is the output for the 3 key intersections between Pearl
and Proctor. The N Pearl St. intersection was not analyzed for two reasons. First, the
intersection lane configurations will not be modified; second the lane merging and diverging at
the east leg of the intersection will occur approximately 400-600 FT. east of the intersection and
will not impacts the approach capacity of the overall intersection.

TABLE 1 TRAFFIC OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS USING SYNCHRO

Notes:

    1. Cycle Length: Intersection Splits were optimized using existing 90 sec cycle length.
    2. Blue Color: 0.5% compound growth rates (or 1.14 Growth Factor) were considered estimating
       the future traffic volumes over 20 years. Growth Rate was estimated using the traffic volumes
       predicted by the City of Tacoma Travel Demand Model.
    3. Traffic re-distribution was not considered estimating the future traffic volumes.
    4. ATL: Auxiliary Through Lane
    5. Phasing at Proctor was modified.

The Transportation Element of the Tacoma Comprehensive Plan sets LOS (i.e. Level of
Service) standards citywide, and currently requires LOS E on arterial corridors and LOS D on all
other arterials and connectors. N 21st St. is a connecting corridor therefore LOS D is the LOS
standard for intersection study. Any intersection that has an LOS worse than LOS D is a
deficient intersection. The intersection LOS criteria were defined based on control delay in
seconds (sec) according to the HCM 2000.

LOS/Control Delay (Delay/Vehicle) Summary:
The intersection LOS results were summarized for Scenario 1 and 2 in TABLE 1 TRAFFIC
OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS USING SYNCHRO. The 3 key intersections (Orchard, Steven, and
Proctor) are operating at acceptable LOS, and will be operated at acceptable LOS for scenarios
1 and 2. The EB-WB lane reduction for Scenario 2 will not have significant affects the overall
intersection LOS.

95th Percentile Queue Length Summary:
The estimated 95th percentile queue length for the Scenario 1 and 2 are acceptable and no
major impact was identified. However, the WB queue length at these three (3) intersections was
increased significantly.

 V/C (Volume to Capacity) Ratio Summary:
 The estimated V/C ratio for Scenario 1 and 2 are acceptable and no major impact was
 identified. However the highest V/C ratio that was observed is 0.7 for WB through lane for 2040
 scenario at N Steven St.

 Summary:
 Overall, intersection and approach LOS, 95th percentile queue length and V/C ratio is not critical
 for scenarios 1 and 2. Scenario 2 which proposes 3 lane section roadways (one EB-WB CTL
 and a TWLTL) with separate left turn bay at the three signalized key intersections between
 Proctor and Pearl. There are two WB through lanes and one EB through lane at the east leg of
 Proctor. To build Scenario 2 the curbside WB CTL at the east leg of N Proctor St. needs to be
 converted into a partial ATL (i.e. a limited-length through lane continuous at the upstream of the
 intersection but tapered and reduced to one lane several hundred feet at the downstream of the
 intersection); see the Figure 9: Lane Merge at the Proctor End. There are two EB-WB through
 lanes at the east leg of N Pearl St. To accommodate the modifications that are recommended
 by Scenario 2, the curbside EB CTL at the east leg of N Pearl St. needs to be converted to a
 partial ATL between Pearl and Highland, and WB through lane needs to be converted to two
 lanes, see the Figure 10: Lane Transition at the Pearl End. These two possible land transitions
 would possibly take place between Pearl and Winnifred.

 The intersection traffic operational MOE’s (i.e. measure of effectiveness) will remain the same at
 Pearl and Proctor. However, due to conversion of the curbside CTL to a partial ATL, the traffic
 operational impact will occur at the downstream of the both intersections where the possible
 lane transitions would take place. The possible impacts are listed below:

                                                                 The potential “Lane Merge”

     1. The through travelers will be discouraged to use either northerly/southerly curbside lane
        due to lane reduction at the downstream of the Proctor and Pearl intersections. It would
        hamper on the overall curbside approach lane utilization.
     2. The traffic from the curbside lane will be competing with the traffic from the inside
        through lane in order to merge into the inside lane to go straight. The lane change would
        create additional weaving.

An in-depth analysis was conducted to assess the possible impacts of the partial ATL and
downstream/upstream ATL length.

5. Partial Auxiliary through Lane Analysis:

     5.1. Auxiliary Lane Traffic Volume Analysis\Lane Utilization:
The proposed alternative Scenario 2 would convert the EB and WB curbside CTL to a partial
ATL at Pearl and Proctor respectively to build 3 lane section roadways between Winnifred and
Proctor. Therefore, the amount of traffic that is using the curbside EB-WB through lane may
decrease in order to avoid the downstream weaving to merge to the inside CTL to go straight. It
may affect the EB-WB approach capacity and the overall intersection traffic operation at Pearl
and Proctor.

A limited hour (1/2 hour) traffic count during the peak period was conducted to estimate the
eastbound lane utilization at the west leg of the Pearl intersection. 37% of the EB traffic use the
curbside EB lane, and 63% use the inside EB lane. The EB curbside lane utilization is a lot
lower than expected (as there are no immediate downstream intersections that are causing the
traffic to use the inside lane) and is almost half when compared to the EB inside lane usage. A
similar land utilization was estimated based on the field observed traffic counts at east leg of the
Proctor intersection. 53% of the WB traffic use the curbside WB lane, and 47% use the inside

WB lane. The WB curbside lane utilization is higher than expected and is almost equal lane
usage.

The guidelines, numerical procedures and suggestions from the NCHRP (National Cooperative
Highway Research Program) report 707 “Guidelines on the Use of Auxiliary Through Lanes
at Signalized Intersections” was consulted to estimate the potential lane utilization after the
EB-WB curbside CTL is converted to partial ATL.

Step 1: Estimate the though-movement demand to capacity (                       ) using Equation 3-2 at N
Proctor St. (Ref: NCHRP Report 707)

          --------Equation 3-2 (Ref: NCHRP Report 707)

Where:
V = 15 - minute through-movement demand flow rate on the approach, expressed in vehicles
per hour;
S = Adjusted through saturation flow rate per lane on the approach, in vehicles per hour;
g= Effective green time for the approach, in seconds; and
c= Intersection cycle length, in seconds.
                   = 0.56
           .



Step 2: Estimate the predicted through-movement flow rate in the ATL (in vehicles per hour)
using Equation 3-3 at N Proctor St. (Ref: NCHRP Report 707)

       20.226        81.791          1.65             --------Equation 3-3 (Ref: NCHRP Report 707)
                                              ,


       20.226        81.791   0.56     1.65              - = 108
                                                  ,

    = 618-108 = 510

The ATL utilization =         = 18%

The existing field estimated lane utilization was 53% at Proctor, and the predicted lane
utilization would be 18%. The lane utilization impacts due to lane conversation of WB curbside
CTL to partial ATL would be significant, and may affect the WB approach level capacity and
overall intersection traffic operations. A similar estimation was conducted for Pearl intersection.
The existing field estimated lane utilization was 37% at Pearl, and the predicted lane utilization
is 31%. The lane utilization impact due to lane conversation of EB curbside CTL to partial ATL
would be minimal, and would not affect the EB approach level capacity and overall intersection
traffic operations at Pearl. However, as it is mentioned earlier due to conversion of the curbside
CTL to a partial ATL the traffic operational impact will also occur at the downstream of the study

intersection. Therefore, the length of downstream ATL is very critical. The downstream ATL
length is analyzed below.

    5.2. Auxiliary Travel Lane (ATL) Length Analysis:
The EB-WB curbside lane at Proctor and Pearl may become a trap lane for the through
travelers if adequate downstream ALT length is not provided. If the downstream ATL length is
too short then drivers might feel the distance is too short to safely merge into the CTL
downstream. Drivers may merge while accelerating on the short downstream lane and accident
risks will increase. The long downstream lanes increase the exposure area for conflicts and may
result in unexpected merges beyond the intersection. In order to maintain safe and efficient
traffic operation downstream of the intersection and the overall intersection traffic operation, the
length of the ATL must be thoroughly calculated.

National resource documents provided limited guidance in determining downstream ATL length.
NCHRP report 707 provided a theoretical model determining the downstream ATL length. It
provided a planning tool determining downstream ATL length, see the Figure 11: Exhibit 5-14
Planning Tool Determining ATL Length (Ref: NCHRP Report 707). The downstream ATL length
was determined based on two different concepts:

DSL1: The downstream length is estimated based on storage of vehicles at the desired spacing
in the downstream length (Ref: NCHRP Report 707). The estimated DSL1 is 160 ft. and 165 ft.
at Proctor and Pearl respectively.

DSL2: The 2nd criterion the gap availability and acceptance under uninterrupted flow conditions,
especially on high-speed approaches (Ref: NCHRP Report 707). The estimated DSL2 is 250 ft.
and 265 ft. at Proctor and Pearl respectively.

The potential downstream ATL length lies between 160 and 250 ft. and between 165 and 265 ft. at Proctor and Pearl
respectively. However, the ATL length is derived from calculations using a planning tool provided in the NCHRP
Report 707. The ATL length was further investigated and we observed the traffic lane changing behavior in a micro-
simulation environment below.

    investigated in a traffic micro simulation environment. No major issue was observed at the Pearl
    end. Scenario 2 at the Proctor end was simulated for an hour with different ATL lengths. The
    SIM-Traffic software allows for only 100 ft taper length models. According to MUTCD standard
    guidelines the taper length should be 245 ft (Ref Formula:                              	           = w, ATL lane Width, V,
    Posted Speed Limit). The default simulation model parameters were adjusted to model field
    observed lane utilization (almost equal lane usage) at the Proctor End for both cases.

Observation 1: The traffic operation at the downstream ATL lane and upstream were observed.
We found that traffic at the upstream of Proctor was using both lanes and as the traffic
approaching to the Proctor, traffic from the curbside ATL were finding safe gap to merge into
the inside CTL to go straight. The merging was mostly occurring between Adams and Proctor,
which may affect the Proctor’s WB approach capacity. The traffic simulation observations from
the two consecutive time (1 & 2) step simulation were captured. See the Figure 14: Sim-Traffic

Observation 2: The traffic operation at the downstream ATL lane and upstream were observed.
We found that traffic at the upstream of Proctor and at the Proctor was using both lanes and as
the traffic cross Proctor traffic from the curbside ATL were finding safe gap to merge into the
inside CTL to go straight. The merging was mostly occurring between Proctor and Madison,
which will not affect the Proctor’s WB approach capacity. The traffic simulation observations
from the three consecutive time (1, 2 & 3) steps simulation were captured. See the Figure 15:

       5.4. Possible Implementation Challenges:

  Short Block Length:
  The required ATL length is between 160 and 265 ft. According to MUTCD standard guidelines
  the estimated taper length should be 245 ft. (Ref Formula:                                                       	     V = w, ATL lane Width, V,
  Posted Speed Limit). The proposed ATL length should be between 405 and 510 ft. (including a
  245 ft. Taper) from the stop bar. The block length (the average length between two consecutive
  intersections) at the Proctor end is approximately 300 ft. (See the Figure 16: Available Area to
  Build ATL). To build the ATL more than one block length is required. Therefore, intersection will
  be located within the ATL lane area. This additional access will develop additional side frictions
  and hamper safe traffic operations.

Figure 16: Available Area to Build ATL
Presence of Driveways/Access
There are several driveways and accesses are located on both sides of N 21st St. The presence
of these driveways and accesses within the proposed ATL will hamper safe and efficient lane
transition and overall traffic operations.

Roadway Alignments (Vertical):
The N 21st St. vertical alignment at the Proctor end can be compared with the waves because of
the undulation roadway topography (See Figure 17: Roadway Topography at Proctor End).
Because of the short block length the lane transition from two lanes to one lane would need to
take place over two blocks traveling through a mid-block intersection, because of this undulation
vertical alignment the vertical sight distance (See Figure 17: Roadway Topography at Proctor
End) may be hampered.

6. 80’ Right of Way:
80’ right of way is available between Proctor and Pearl. Once the electric transmissions is
removed the 12-24 FT raised median will be no longer needed. In addition if the through lane is
reduced, a wide area would be available to improve the overall existing roadway section. The
potential different roadway features such as wide/multiuse side walk, bike path, roadside
parking, green alley/space, transit bay etc. can be built within the additional available right of
way.

7. Findings and Recommendations:
The Findings and recommendations are summarized below:

    1. WB through lanes carries approximately 6% more traffic than EB through lanes during
        an average weekday and 9% (38% VS 29%) during PM Peak period (3-7 PM). The WB
        through lanes carries almost 40% of total traffic during PM peak period.
    2. The EB-WB lane reduction for Scenario 2 will not affect the overall intersection traffic
        operations.
    3. The existing field estimated lane utilization was 53% at Proctor, and the predicted lane
        utilization would be 18%. The lane utilization impact due to lane conversion of WB
        curbside CTL to partial ATL would be significant and may affect the WB approach level
        capacity and overall intersection traffic operations. The impact due to lane conversion of
        EB curbside CTL to partial ATL at the Pearl end would be minimal, and would not affect
        the EB approach level capacity and overall intersection traffic operations.
    4. Intersection/drive way (located within the ATL lane area) access may need to be limited
        to right in/out only to ensure safety traffic operation within the ATL lane area. If the
        intersection/drive way traffic increases in future the intersection/drive way function may
        need to be re-evaluated to ensure safe traffic operations
    5. The proposed downstream ATL length should be between 410 and 510 ft (including a
        245 ft taper) from the stop bar. However existing slopes, drainage areas, rights-of-way,
        utilities, and other infrastructure need to be evaluated.
    6. The travel time and corridor LOS between Pearl and Proctor was not evaluated as the
        study was limited to intersection traffic operations only.
    7. Proper signing, striping and pavement marking need to be provided to effectively
        communicate to the drivers that an ATL is ending at a specific distance beyond the
        intersection.
    8. The average 85th percentile speed is 37 mph which is little bit higher than posted speed
        limit. Appropriate traffic calming measures need to be installed to maintain the safe
        speed.
    9. Proper assessment needs to be conducted before adding any transit stops within the
        close proximity of the ATL.
    10. EB-WB lane reductions would not affect the study area intersection traffic operations. It
        serves regional commuter traffic (generated within the City of Tacoma) to avoid
        congested SR-16 route especially during the two (AM & PM) peak periods. The WB
        through lanes carries almost 40% WB traffic during PM peak period. The lane reduction
        at the WB would significantly reduce the WB traffic carrying capacity and overall
        attractiveness of these major arterials. Based on the above findings as well as
        considering the significance and role of N 21st St. it is recommended to reduce EB lane
        (from 2 to 1) and keep two WB lanes. The potential right of way that would be available
        removing electric transmissions and reducing EB lane can be used to build multi-modal
        roadway features between Pearl and Proctor.
