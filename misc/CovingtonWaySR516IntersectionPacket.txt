Project Description
1. Project Scope
   We are seeking funding for the design of additional turn lanes, channelization, and signal
   modiﬁcations at the intersection of SR 516 and Covington Way. This project will also require
   modiﬁcations to the existing stream crossing at the intersection. The total project length is
   ~1000 feet. Design will be tasked with developing a street section consistent with the
   existing SR 516 section including illumination, landscaping, sidewalk, signal, ITS, and planter
   strip buﬀers with street trees.
   This project is inline with the Covington Comprehensive Plan's transportation goals and
   policies.
2. Project Justiﬁcation, Need, or Purpose
   Our City Council, engineering, parks, and development review team are quite concerned over
   the projected 2035 unmitigated LOS through this corridor, with Covington Way being the
   largest bang for the buck. It is ranked as our #3 priority unfunded project in our 6-Year TIP
   and is very important for future Downtown development and densiﬁcation. We have collected
   impact fees for this intersection for some time and we believe it is time to move forward with
   design.
  design.
  Lack of ADA pedestrian push buttons, ADA/truncated domes, lack of concrete bus stop pads,
  and lack of landscaped buﬀered sidewalks, all while ~30,000 vehicles a day traveling around
  43mph, within a curb width away, is concerning.

  This is an important non-motorized corridor, as it leads to the library, schools, and the
  downtown core. There are only three locations in the City to pass over/under SR 18. Of these,
  this segment would serve two of them. On SR 516 under SR 18, and on Covington Way over
  SR 18.
  SR 516 is an urban principal arterial that experiences around 30,000 vehicles a day around
  156th Avenue SE, and 38,000 vehicles a day at the eastbound ramps of SR 18. The posted
  speed is 35 miles per hour. This road is the spine of Covington. It connects with the King
  County Covington Library, the Downtown core, two hospitals, many higher density
  apartments, Maple Valley, and Kent.
  King County Metro bus route #159 begins its morning route at the library on 164th Avenue
  SE. After completing a route through lower income neighborhoods, the route circles back and
  has a westbound stop slightly to the west of 164th Avenue SE. Although this bus stop has a
  far-side pull out lane, it has no concrete pad and riders block the sidewalk. King County Metro
  bus route #168 (30 min headways) also includes this King County Covington Library bus stop
  as well.
  The #159 and #168 also have return trips and stops for eastbound lanes. This stop also has
  a far-side bus pull out lane, but not concrete pad and transit riders block the sidewalk here as
  well.
  In the King County Metro Long Range Plan this route is identiﬁed as one that will become
  Frequent Service. Frequent Service is deﬁned as service that will come every 5 to 15 minutes
  or better all day.

  Express Service has also been included in the Metro Long Range Plan for the adjacent
  westbound SR 18 ramps and SR 516.

  274 accidents have occurred along this identiﬁed project segment between 2010 and 2015.
  Of these 274 accidents occurring within the limits, 4 of them involved bicycles being struck
  by vehicles. One at milepost 11.13 in 2011, one at milepost 11.37 in 2012, and two at
  milepost 11.26 in 2014.

  One pedestrian accident occurred in 2011 at milepost 11.58.
  The desired outcome is clearly non-motorized mobility and safety, as well as preventing rear
  ends with LOS service improvements.

Support for Centers
1. Designated center(s) supported
   This project is located within the City of Covington's designated Downtown Area. The
   Downtown is one of the two centers in the city where we are focusing mixed use commercial
   growth to maintain the quality and character of existing residential neighborhoods while
   meeting the community’s changing needs for housing variety and commercial uses and
   oﬀering more pedestrian amenities and making our community more interconnected and
   walkable.

   In 2009, Covington completed a Downtown Plan and zoning study with widespread
   community input to set a new course and vision for the community. The plan addresses core
   economic development and land use goals including improvements to vehicular linkages,
   providing greater pedestrian connections, development that has a scale and form that is
   walkable and comfortable for pedestrians, establishing new street and building design
   standards and supporting Covington as a regional transportation focal point. The Downtown
   is envisioned to grow as the “heart” of Covington. It is intended to provide the majority of
   retail commercial and oﬃce opportunities within the city, as well as incorporating various civic,
   social, residential and recreational uses. The Downtown will accommodate economic growth
   in a compact form with a mix of uses that lessens automobile trip lengths and promotes travel
   modes other than single-occupancy vehicles.
   More speciﬁcally this project is located near the “gateways” to Downtown Covington. This
   area is intended to accommodate a diverse mix of uses, emphasizing retail and employment,
   with increased walkability and access for all modes of travel. New development is expected to
   be compatible with the area’s pedestrian oriented scale and character. These proposed
   projects will help support this goal.

   Applicable Comprehensive Plan Goals and Policies supported by these projects:
   Framework Goal-X. Mobility: Ensure all residents, regardless of age, mode, or ability, can ﬁnd
   safe comfortable ways to travel through the city and welcoming destinations when they arrive.
   Land Use Element Goal LU-VI. Covington is a walkable community with access to healthy local
   foods, active living facilities, and well-designed and accessible multi- modal connections
   between and within neighborhoods and commercial areas.

   Land Use Policy LU-34. Provide for a sense of gateway and entry to the downtown area
   through the development of key distinctive focal points, such as special signs, architectural,
   water and/or landscaping features.
   water and/or landscaping features.
   Transportation Element Goal T-I. Provide and maintain a complete transportation network that
   safely and eﬃciently accommodates all users.
   Transportation Element Goal T-II. Promote the development of safe and convenient
   pedestrian and bicycle networks that encourage multi-modal access to and from residential
   neighborhoods, parks, schools, civic buildings and the Town Center and Lakepointe Urban
   Village.

   Transportation Element Policy T-22. Address pedestrian safety and access across Kent-
   Kangley Road and SR 18.

Criteria: Center Development
1. Describe how the project will support the existing and planned
   housing/employment densities in the center.
   Covington is a family-oriented community with a predominance of single family homes, a
   larger household size, and a higher percentage of children than King County as a whole.
   Covington’s share of senior citizens is expected to quadruple over the life of the
   Comprehensive Plan; to accommodate this population segment, opportunities for seniors to
   age in place, quality apartments and condominiums, assisted living and day health, and other
   services will be needed. Covington is and will need to be a place for both the young and the
   elderly.
   Covington oﬀers a high quality place to live with homes typically aﬀordable for households at
   moderate and middle incomes. While most households are living in homes aﬀordable to
   them, about one third of households are cost-burdened. Oﬀering a variety of housing
   choices aﬀordable to all economic segments would allow Covington’s current and next
   generation to have a place in the community.
   Today, Covington’s housing pattern is largely single family. Over time, the mixed use nature of
   the Town Center and the new Lakepointe Urban Village will mean a greater share of housing
   styles and variety for families and households.
   Residents value Covington because of its location in southeast King County, its housing
   stock oﬀering relatively aﬀordable homeownership, and its quality schools. Presently, most
   residents commute to work in other locations. While continuing to oﬀer a high quality of life in
   its residential neighborhoods, Covington will also continue its transformation from a bedroom
   community to a community with a commercial and employment core, a trail and park network,
   and a variety of housing choices.
   Covington’s projected increase in jobs will not only provide more opportunities for working
   and shopping in the community, but it may also improve the community’s jobs-housing
   balance and reduce transportation costs, allowing more home and recreation time in
   Covington. While changes in travel patterns will depend on attracting jobs that match the
   community’s education and oﬀer living wages, some residents may continue choosing to
   commute.

   Essentially, to attract more densiﬁcation to our Downtown core, we must mitigate the
   intersection that has been partially paid towards with traﬃc impact fees, and address the
   larger denser more aﬀordable apartments and senior living that is being built in Downtown.
   This project not only mitigates the corrects and most burdened intersection in the city, it
   allows us to continue to have people move into an area where they may have alternative
   commutes to automobiles.
2. Describe how the project will support the development/redevelopment plans and
   activities (objectives and aims) of the center. Please provide a citation of the
   corresponding policies and/or speciﬁc project references in a subarea plan or in
   the comprehensive plan.
   The City experienced a compound annual growth rate of 2.5% between 2000 and 2010,
   slowing to 0.5% between 2010 and 2015. Covington’s growth rate was higher than King
   County’s compound annual growth rate of 1.4% between 2000 and 2010, and is similar now
   to the County’s rate of 0.6% between 2010 and 2015.
   Covington also realized strong employment growth from 2003 to 2013. See Exhibit LU-4.
   Local-serving industries such as services, retail, and government/education make up the
   largest share of the City’s employment base. Retail sector employment has grown the most
   and the fastest from 2003 to 2013.

   Covington is forecast to grow nearly 50% to approximately 27,645 residents by 2035. See
   Exhibit LU-5. Currently, there are approximately 6,374 dwellings (OFM 2015) and most are
   occupied with 5,957 households (ACS 2013). Based on a market demand study (BERK
   2012), it is anticipated that there will be 3,920 added dwellings. This will result in a total of
   9,826 households and 10,294 dwellings by 2035.
  The City has a solid base of jobs, largely retail and service oriented, equaling 4,753 jobs.
  (ESD, 2013). Based on a market analysis (BERK, 2012), the City would add over 1.6 million
  square feet of commercial space by 2035, which would support over 3,700 jobs. That would
  mean a total of 8,459 jobs by 2035. See Exhibit LU-5. The Economic Development Element
  discusses jobs and the economic outlook in more detail.
  Covington now contains an urgent care facility, and is becoming a hub for medical services in
  the southeast King County area. A hospital is planned.
  Continuing to attract professional services, medical services, and other jobs that have the
  potential to support living wages is important to the City’s overall economic development
  goals and would promote sustainable living by helping reduce single occupancy vehicle
  driving.
  The predominant land use within Covington’s city limits is single family residential. While this
  will remain Covington’s predominant land use, there is limited vacant land left to develop for
  single family residential uses. Covington’s population is growing and changing, with more
  senior citizens and with households that are cost-burdened, meaning they are spending
  more than 30% of their income on housing and utilities and earning below the County median
  income. Thus, Covington is in need of greater housing variety such as townhomes and
  mixed-use residential, as noted in the Housing Element.

  Similarly with Covington striving to become a commercial, professional, and medical services
  hub for southeast King County, more jobs are expected, and the City’s suburban commercial
  areas are expected to experience new development and redevelopment over the next 20
  years.
  The City is actively planning for well-designed, high quality mixed-use development focused in
  the Town Center zone and within portions of the Lakepointe Urban Village.
  By focusing most growth in these two areas, the City can maintain the quality and character of
  existing residential neighborhoods while meeting the community’s changing needs for
  housing variety and oﬀering more pedestrian amenities, public gathering spaces, and
  gridded streets. New development, whether it locates in the downtown, the Lakepointe
  Urban Village or within the community’s established neighborhoods, must be compatible with
  its surroundings and enhance Covington’s community identity and the character of the
  neighborhood in which it is located.

  Downtown and Town Center
  Covington’s Downtown area is presently in a low rise development pattern, with commercial
  shopping centers predominating. See Exhibit LU-8 on prior page.
  In 2009, Covington completed a Downtown Plan and zoning study to set a new course and
  vision for the community. The plan addresses core economic development and land use
  goals:
  Identify a new town center site
  Make strategic town center investments
  Improve vehicular linkages
  Develop a parking study
  Provide greater pedestrian connections
  Establish new street and building design standards
  Consider and support Covington as a regional transportation focal point
  The proposed land use pattern is based on a dense, pedestrian-friendly core surrounded by
  several districts:
  The future downtown area should consist of a central Town Center District developed around
  a central civic plaza and open space, a new City Hall and/or other community facilities, and a
  public parking facility/transit center. Surrounding this Town Center core should be other Mixed
  Commercial and/or General Commercial districts permitting a wide variety of retail, residential,
  oﬃce, service, and public uses. Surrounding the retail, residential, oﬃce, service and public
  uses should be a less intensive Mixed Housing and Oﬃce district with a variety of housing
  and oﬃce uses at various levels of density and height. These four inter-related but discreet
  land use districts are described below. They are (a) Town Center; (b) Mixed Commercial; (c)
  Mixed Housing and Oﬃce; and (d) General Commercial.
  Downtown Vision
  The vision is to create a dynamic Town Center that includes retail, oﬃce, residential, and
  communal gathering spaces, and provides for development-friendly zoning and
  transportation requirements as well as improved surrounding areas. See Exhibit LU-9.

3. Describe how the project will support the establishment of new jobs/businesses
   or the retention of existing jobs/businesses including those in the industry
   clusters identiﬁed in the adopted Regional Economic Strategy.
   Freight Mobility
   Freight Mobility

   SR 18 carries more than 10 million tons of freight per year, and is thus designated by WSDOT
   as a T-1 freight corridor.

   SE 272nd Street (SR 516) carries between 4 and 10 million tons of freight per year, and is
   designated as a T-2 freight corridor. All T-1 and T-2 corridors are included in the Washington
   State Freight and Goods Transportation System (FGTS) network. The FGTS is used to support
   statewide freight planning, to establish funding eligibility for freight improvements, and to plan
   for pavement needs and upgrades.

   No other streets in Covington are included in the FGTS network, but the following streets are
   categorized as T-3 freight corridors, meaning that they carry between 300 thousand and 4
   million tons of freight per year.
   SE 256th Street
   Covington Way SE (between 165th Place and SE 272nd Street)
   168th Place SE (between Covington Way SE and SE 272nd Street)
   164th Avenue SE
   180th Avenue SE
   SE Wax Road

   These streets are all classiﬁed as arterials or major collectors, except for 168th Place SE
   which has been identiﬁed by the City to be upgraded to a major collector.

   In general, City design standards for arterials and collectors support freight movement by
   accommodating large vehicles and higher traﬃc volumes.

   In summary, this project gives beneﬁt to a T1 freight corridor, where it intersects a T2 freight
   corridor, by making improvements at a T2/T3 freight corridor intersection.

Criteria: Beneﬁt to the Center
1. Describe how the project remedies a current or anticipated problem (e.g.
   congestion, incomplete sidewalk system, inadequate transit service/facilities,
   modal conﬂicts and/or the preservation of essential freight movement)?
   The project will address the most congested intersection within the city, it will correct and
   improve the sidewalk system, it will address inadequate transit service facilities such as
   installing concrete bus pads, it will accommodate newer ADA standards, and it will continue to
   provide reliable operations for our T1, T2, and T3 corridors all meeting in one interchange.

   Freight is absolutely critical.
2. Identify the diﬀerent user groups being served by the project, including
   commuters, residents, commercial users, minority and low-income populations
   as identiﬁed in the President’s Order for Environmental Justice, seniors, people
   with disabilities, those located in highly impacted communities, and/or areas
   experiencing high levels of unemployment or chronic underemployment; please
   be speciﬁc and provide data where applicable.
   The City seeks to provide a multi-modal transportation network within a balanced ﬁnancial
   strategy, improving travel choices and the travel experience for all community members.

   Completing the non-ideal link sidewalk supports Covington and regional policies that
   encourage local and regional agencies to enhance non-motorized transportation by
   improving accessibility and safety and an attractive alternate modes of transportation to the
   single-occupancy vehicle. One of the major beneﬁts of this project is to improve safety for
   pedestrian travel with the installation of a missing link sidewalk separated from the travel
   lanes by a vegetated buﬀer and current ADA pedestrian ramps.

   This project is located adjacent to the city’s designated Downtown Area. The Downtown is
   one of the two centers in the city where we are focusing mixed use commercial growth to
   maintain the quality and character of existing residential neighborhoods while meeting the
   community’s changing needs for housing variety and commercial uses and oﬀering more
   pedestrian amenities and making our community more interconnected and walkable.

   The project completes a missing non-ideal pedestrian link in the sidewalk network,
   connecting neighborhoods to crucial downtown services. Improving sidewalks on the north
   and south sides of SR 516 will contribute to the creation and completion of an active
   transportation network, that connects neighborhoods with the rest of the community,
   improves pedestrian access to transit (King County Metro Routes #159 and #168), and
   provides a route to the library and schools that are accessible to people of all ages, abilities,
   races, and income groups.
3. Describe how the project will beneﬁt the user groups identiﬁed above.
   Our walkway improvement needs and policy requirements are identiﬁed in our
   Comprehensive Plan pages T-13 through T-14, and attached as "Walkway needs Trans
   Element". Our existing transit routes are identiﬁed in the attachment "Transit Trans Element".
   Future Transit policies and goals are identiﬁed in the attached "Transit Improvements Trans
   Element". As part of the High and Medium Priority Bike Facility needs, Covington Way will need
   to maintain its existing bike lanes.
   To summarize the comp plan, these facilities must exist at the existing LOS or higher.

   King County Metro bus route #159 begins its morning route at the library on 164th Avenue
   SE. After completing a route through lower income neighborhoods, the route circles back and
   has a westbound stop slightly to the west of 164th Avenue SE. Although this bus stop has a
   far-side pull out lane, it has no concrete pad and riders block the sidewalk. King County Metro
   bus route #168 (30 min headways) also includes this King County Covington Library bus stop
   as well.

   The #159 and #168 also have return trips and stops for eastbound lanes. This stop also has
   a far-side bus pull out lane, but not concrete pad and transit riders block the sidewalk here as
   well.
   In the King County Metro Long Range Plan this route is identiﬁed as one that will become
   Frequent Service. Frequent Service is deﬁned as service that will come every 5 to 15 minutes
   or better all day.

   Express Service has also been included in the Metro Long Range Plan for the adjacent
   westbound SR 18 ramps and SR 516.

Criteria: Circulation Within the Center
1. Describe how the project improves safe & convenient access to major
   destinations within the center, such as by completing a physical gap or providing
   an essential link in the transportation network for people and/or goods.
   This project will complete inadequate gaps in the sidewalk network by providing a vegetative
   buﬀer between ~43mph vehicles with volumes exceeding 30,000 vehicles a day. By
   expanding the pedestrian safety footprint, this section of SR 516 will become more appealing
   to pedestrians and transit riders. The King County Covington Library will draw quite a few non-
   motorized trips to this area. Establishing proper Metro Bus Stop Facilities will not only induce
   non-motorized travel, but it will be perfectly inline with King County Metro's Long Range Plan
   of providing frequent bus service to this segment of road, as well as providing a new Express
   Bus Route on SR 18 passing adjacent to this project.
2. Describe how the project will improve circulation within the center and enhance
   opportunities for active transportation that can provide public health beneﬁts
   through the following relevant areas: walkability, public transit access, public
   transit speed and reliability, safety & security, bicycle mobility, bicycle facilities,
   streetscape improvements, traﬃc calming, etc. Describe how the project
   provides users (e.g. employees, residents, customers) a range of travel modes
   or provides a “missing” mode.
   Yes, vehicles and truck deliveries heading from the west to the Downtown core will travel less
   miles when the eastbound right turn at Covington Way is no longer blocked by eastbound
   thru vehicles. Creating a double northbound left turn at SR 516 and Covington Way will allow
   vehicles to slip past the SR 18 / SR 516 interchange un-impeded. It will also allow vehicles to
   take un-impeded right turns from Covington Way to eastbound SR 516, then take an un-
   impeded eastbound right turn onto the westbound SR 18 on ramps. This will the time empty
   freight vehicles idle at these intersections within the interchange.

   The primary traﬃc generators in the Downtown core are Costco, Fred Meyer, Valley Medical,
   the new Polaris apartments, and soon the Covington Town Center. Providing signalized
   intersection improvements at Covington Way will make the under-capacity 5-lane roadway
   quite a bit more appealing, all while reducing the lengths of trips.
3. If the project has a parking component, describe how it has been designed to be
   compatible with a pedestrian oriented environment, including any innovative
   parking management tools.
   Parking is not provided on this project. We do hope that less of existing parking remains
   utilized.

Air Quality and Climate Change: Element Selection
1. Please select one or more elements in the list below that are included in the
   project’s scope of work, and provide the requested information in the pages to
   follow.
    Roadway Improvement, Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities, Intelligent Transportation Systems

Air Quality and Climate Change: Roadway Improvement
 1. What is the length of the project?
    ~1000 feet
 2. What is the average daily traﬃc before and after the project?
    In a segment of SR 516 just to the west of this intersection, at 156th Avenue SE which is the
    western limits of this project, the average daily traﬃc last fall was approximately 30,000
    vehicles. Vehicle classiﬁcation of this same location last fall was approximately 10.2% trucks.
    See attached documents "Volume SR 516 and 156th" as well as "Classiﬁcation SR 516 and
    156th Ave SE".
    The ADT taken around 750' to the east of the eastern limits of this project, was approximately
    38,000 vehicles. This is the eastbound ramps of SR 18 where it meets SR 516. At this same
    location last fall, the vehicle truck classiﬁcation registered approximately 6.4% trucks. See
    attached documents "Volume 7-day SR 516 east of EB Ramps" and "Classiﬁcation SR 516
    east of EB Ramps".
    The ADT and vehicle classiﬁcations were also taken along Covington Way just south of SR 18
    last fall. The volume of Covington Way was approximately 13,000 vehicles a day. The vehicle
    classiﬁcation counted approximately 8% of vehicles as trucks. See attached documents
    "Volume Covington Way south of SR 18" and "Classiﬁcation Covington Way south of SR 18".
    These volume trends and vehicle classiﬁcation counts hint at Covington Way being an ideal
    delivery route for our Downtown Commercial zone.

    After the project is complete we imagine the average daily traﬃc will increase in the new
    eastbound right turn (slip lane) to westbound SR 18. We hope this draws more vehicles to
    use the Covington Way northbound right turn lane, skirting around the busier portions of
    downtown. We also hope an eastbound right turn at Covington Way increases in volume,
    having local downtown travelers skirt around the fringes of downtown, rather than pass
    through the SR 18 Freeway to SR 516 Highway Interchange. In all instances, giving vehicles
    these free right turns will keep them from being blocked by through movements, will reduce
    queue lengths, and will allow more volume to be processed in the same amount of green
    time.
 3. What is the average speed before and after the project?
    The last average speed along this section of SR 516, taken on the eastern limits of this
    project, was conducted in 2011. The average speed of westbound vehicles was 44mph. The
    average speed of eastbound vehicles was 42mph.

    I do not see this increasing with this project.
 4. What is the average daily transit ridership along the corridor?
    No BAT or HOV lanes
 5. How many daily peak period transit trips serve the corridor?
    No BAT or HOV lanes
 6. What is the expected increase in transit speed due to the BAT/HOV lanes?
    No BAT or HOV lanes
 7. What is the expected increase in transit ridership due to the BAT/HOV lanes?
    No BAT or HOV lanes
 8. What is the percentage of freight truck traﬃc on the facility?
    As discussed above, western portion is 10.2%, eastern portion is 6.4%, southern portion is
    8%
 9. Will the project result in shorter trips and reduced VMT? If so, please explain.
    Yes, vehicles and truck deliveries heading from the west to the Downtown core will travel less
    miles when the eastbound right turn at Covington Way is no longer blocked by eastbound
    thru vehicles. Creating a double northbound left turn at SR 516 and Covington Way will allow
    vehicles to slip past the SR 18 / SR 516 interchange un-impeded. It will also allow vehicles to
    take un-impeded right turns from Covington Way to eastbound SR 516, then take an un-
    impeded eastbound right turn onto the westbound SR 18 on ramps. This will the time empty
    freight vehicles idle at these intersections within the interchange.

    The primary traﬃc generators in the Downtown core are Costco, Fred Meyer, Valley Medical,
    the new Polaris apartments, and soon the Covington Town Center. Providing signalized
    intersection improvements at Covington Way will make the under-capacity 5-lane roadway
    quite a bit more appealing, all while reducing the lengths of trips.

    "Under the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA), concurrency is the
    requirement that adequate infrastructure be planned and ﬁnanced to support the City’s
    adopted future land use plan. Level of service (LOS) standards are used to evaluate the
    roadway impacts of long-term development growth. To monitor concurrency, Covington has
    deﬁned LOS standards for City streets under Policy T-2 that reﬂect the acceptable level of
    vehicular operating conditions. If a street’s operation is worse than the City’s adopted
    standard, a deﬁciency is identiﬁed.

    The City has developed a travel demand forecasting model to analyze future travel demand
    and traﬃc patterns that would result from buildout of the Future Land Use Map in the Land
    Use Element. Projections were completed for the long-range planning year of 2035, taking
    into account additional traﬃc resulting from regional development growth. Analysis was
    completed for traﬃc conditions during the weekday PM peak hour, which is the hour in which
    the highest level of traﬃc typically occurs and is the time period in which concurrency
    assessment is based." -Covington 2015-2035 Comprehensive Plan
    Please see attached Exhibit T-7 from our Comprehensive Plan, titled "Covington Way
    Intersection the worst LOS in 2035." The intersection has been modeled to show a 2035 LOS
    of F, with 103 seconds of intersection delay per vehicle. By far, the worst case future
    intersection LOS within the city.

Air Quality and Climate Change: Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
 1. Describe the facilities being added or improved
    We are seeking funding for the design of additional turn lanes, channelization, and signal
    modiﬁcations at the intersection of SR 516 and Covington Way. This project will also require
    modiﬁcations to the existing stream crossing at the intersection. The total project length is
    ~1000 feet. Design will be tasked with developing a street section consistent with the
    existing SR 516 section including illumination, landscaping, sidewalk, signal, ITS, and planter
    strip buﬀers with street trees.

    The key pedestrian facilities being the sidewalk, ADA ramps, ADA push buttons, landscaping,
    and planter strip buﬀers with street trees.

    Please see the attached photos to recognize the deﬁciencies in sidewalks, as well as King
    County Metro Bus stops along the corridor. We believe these can easily be improved, while
    making them appealing, and drawing more use of transit facilities. These two bus stop
    locations act as the primary stops for the King County Covington Library. The attached photos
    are referred to as; "Existing Ped facility exposure without buﬀer", "Metro route #168 and
    #159 eastbound bus stop" and "Our embarrassing Metro route #168 and #159 westbound
    bus stop".

    We are exited to ﬁx these facilities.
 2. What is the length of the proposed facility?
    1000' on south side, and 1000' on north side will most likely accommodate all needed
    changes
 3. Describe the connections to existing bicycle/pedestrian facilities and transit.
    Our walkway improvement needs and policy requirements are identiﬁed in our
    Comprehensive Plan pages T-13 through T-14, and attached as "Walkway needs Trans
    Element". Our existing transit routes are identiﬁed in the attachment "Transit Trans Element".
    Future Transit policies and goals are identiﬁed in the attached "Transit Improvements Trans
    Element". As part of the High and Medium Priority Bike Facility needs, Covington Way will need
    to maintain its existing bike lanes.

    To summarize the comp plan, these facilities must exist at the existing LOS or higher.
    King County Metro bus route #159 begins its morning route at the library on 164th Avenue
    SE. After completing a route through lower income neighborhoods, the route circles back and
    has a westbound stop slightly to the west of 164th Avenue SE. Although this bus stop has a
    far-side pull out lane, it has no concrete pad and riders block the sidewalk. King County Metro
    bus route #168 (30 min headways) also includes this King County Covington Library bus stop
    as well.

    The #159 and #168 also have return trips and stops for eastbound lanes. This stop also has
    a far-side bus pull out lane, but not concrete pad and transit riders block the sidewalk here as
    well.
    In the King County Metro Long Range Plan this route is identiﬁed as one that will become
    Frequent Service. Frequent Service is deﬁned as service that will come every 5 to 15 minutes
    or better all day.
   or better all day.

   Express Service has also been included in the Metro Long Range Plan for the adjacent
   westbound SR 18 ramps and SR 516.
4. Describe the current bicycle/pedestrian usage in the project area. If known,
   provide information on the shift from single occupancy vehicles.
   Please use PSRC regional default data for facilities near King County Libraries.
5. What is the expected increase in bicycle/pedestrian usage from the project? If
   known, provide information on the shift from single occupancy vehicles
   Please use PSRC regional default data for facilities near King County Libraries.
6. What is the average bicycle trip length?
   Please use PSRC regional default data for facilities near King County Libraries.
7. What is the average pedestrian trip length?
   Please use PSRC regional default data for facilities near King County Libraries.
8. Please describe the source of the project data provided above (e.g.,
   Environmental Impact Statement, EPA/DOE data, traﬃc study, survey, previous
   projects, etc.)

Air Quality and Climate Change: Intelligent Transportation
Systems and Corridor Eﬃciency
1. What is the existing level of service?
   Modeled existing (2012) LOS is E with 56.6 seconds of average delay for all vehicles through
   the intersection
2. What are the existing number of lanes (in one direction)?
   2 thru lanes, 1 left turn lane
3. What is the existing average daily traﬃc?
   Bewteen 30,000 and 38,000 as per fall counts. In a segment of SR 516 just to the west of
   this intersection, at 156th Avenue SE which is the western limits of this project, the average
   daily traﬃc last fall was approximately 30,000 vehicles. Vehicle classiﬁcation of this same
   location last fall was approximately 10.2% trucks. See attached documents "Volume SR 516
   and 156th" as well as "Classiﬁcation SR 516 and 156th Ave SE".
4. What is the existing average speed?
   The last average speed along this section of SR 516, taken on the eastern limits of this
   project, was conducted in 2011. The average speed of westbound vehicles was 44mph. The
   average speed of eastbound vehicles was 42mph.
5. What are the ITS improvements being provided?
   We wish to reconnect the WSDOT ﬁber after it is destroyed by the sidewalk relocation.
   Existing ﬁber runs through an old 1" rusted steel conduit that is full of sediment. WSDOT ITS
   has expressed concerns over possible old steel communications conduits not being property
   grounded. This project would upsize conduit to 2" Schedule 80 HDPE under roadway
   crossings. It would reduce the potential of freeze/thaw ﬁber breakages, and it would allow
   new junction boxes to be property sized for ﬁber bending radii.

   A new 332 Double wide cabinet would allow for ITS and Data expansion. It would also allow for
   the inclusion of Battery Backup which would allow this signal to operate from 6 to 8 hours
   during power disruptions. This would allow vehicles to continue to use the SR 516 and SR 18
   freeway facilities during emergencies and natural events.

   This intersection would also be installed with a PTZ camera in which traﬃc events can be
   monitored and managed. Video decoders would exist in the WSDOT Shoreline TMC and
   Traﬃc Busters connections to both Kent and Covington would allow the viewing of these
   cameras.

   WSDOT would have to opportunity to migrate their Covington Way Traﬃc Signal controller
   back onto their network, and would allow for the connection to their new Central Signal
   Software "Intolight". This centralized signal platform would allow Covington to view a remote
   client terminal station at the City of Covington.
6. How many intersections are being improved?
   Technically 2, with a strong inﬂuence on 4
7. What is the length of the project?
   1000'
8. What is the percentage of freight truck traﬃc in the project area?
   Between 10.2% and 6.4% depending on the leg of the intersection, as stated above in ADT
     Between 10.2% and 6.4% depending on the leg of the intersection, as stated above in ADT
     volumes and Truck Classiﬁcation Counts
 9. What is the expected improvement to level of service?
    Traﬃc Concurrency Modeling done by DEA projects a future unmitigated 2035 LOS of F going
    to a D.
10. What is the expected improvement to average speed?
    I believe the average speed studies in 2011 of 42mph and 44mph for a posted 35mph speed
    segment seems higher than it is in reality. I believe the study only reﬂects free ﬂow speeds,
    while congestion between 7:00am and 8:00pm limits vehicles from obtaining these speeds.

     I believe speeds could increase slightly, but aspirations of the project are to reduce queue
     lengths and delays.
11. What is the expected improvement to average vehicle delay?
    Per DEA concurrency modeling, expectations are change of LOS F to LOS D, therefore an
    average vehicle delay improvement could be as high as 48 seconds per vehicle thru the
    intersection.
12. Please describe the source of the project data provided above (e.g.,
    Environmental Impact Statement, EPA/DOE data, traﬃc study, survey, previous
    projects, etc.)
