901 Harrison                                                                            August 2014



                                    Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed-use building located on the southeast corner of
9th Avenue N and Harrison Street in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle. As
necessary, mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce significant
transportation related impacts that the project may have on the surrounding transportation
system. This report also contains an independent transportation impact fee calculation,
consistent with methodologies for developments in the South Lake Union area as outlined in
the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) Tip # 243.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the east side of 9th Avenue N between Harrison Street
and Thomas Street in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood. Figure 1 illustrates the
proposed project site and the surrounding vicinity. The site is currently occupied by a
hardware store and small retail space.

The proposed project would replace the existing buildings with a multifamily residential
building with ground floor retail. The building would include 318 apartment units and
approximately 10,500 square feet of retail. A parking garage would be provided on-site with
163 stalls and vehicular access to the garage via the alley between 9th Avenue N and
Westlake Avenue N. The parking garage would also include secured bicycle parking with as
84 long-term and 4 short-term bicycle parking spaces. The main pedestrian access to the
residences would be provided along 9th Avenue N south of Harrison Street. A preliminary site
plan for the development is shown on Figure 2. The proposed project is anticipated to be
constructed and occupied by 2018.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis is based on previous traffic studies conducted in the South Lake
Union area and coordination with City of Seattle DPD. Based on the anticipated vehicular
impacts of the proposed project, the following intersections were selected for analysis:
    1. 9th Avenue N / Harrison Street
    2. Westlake Avenue N / Harrison Street
    3. 9th Avenue N / Thomas Street
    4. Westlake Avenue N / Thomas Street
    A. Alley Access (between 9th Avenue N and Westlake Avenue N) / Harrison Street
    B. Alley Access (between 9th Avenue N and Westlake Avenue N) / Thomas Street

Three of the four study intersections are controlled by traffic signals. The intersection of 9th
Avenue N/Thomas Street is currently side-street stop controlled with stop signs located on
the east and west legs.

Consistent with City requirements, the study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour. The
analysis begins by describing conditions in the vicinity of the project site, including the
roadway network, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2018)
with-project conditions are determined by adding site-generated traffic to future without-
project volumes. The project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation system were
identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the future without-project
conditions.

   Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes both existing and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
identified study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the roadway network and
planned improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, transit service, and non-motorized facilities.


Roadway Network
The following sections describe the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed
project and any anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.

Existing Inventory
Characteristics of the existing street network in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is surrounding by two and four-lane
facilities with relatively low travel speeds. The street system in the vicinity of the site provides
pedestrian and bicycle connections as well as parking.

Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2013 – 2018 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) two transportation projects were identified and are anticipated to be completed by 2018
that may affect vehicle travel patterns in the project vicinity. Details related to roadway
improvements in the study area are described below.

Mercer Corridor Project – Mercer West construction began in April 2013 and is anticipated
to be completed by 2015. The project will extend the Mercer East improvements by
constructing three continuous westbound through lanes from Dexter Avenue N to Elliot
Avenue W to make Mercer Street a two-way street from I-5 to Elliot Avenue W. Roy Street
will also be converted into a two-way street. This project will provide east-west connectivity
through the South Lake Union, Westlake, and Lower Queen Anne neighborhoods. It will also
provide vehicular access to the north portal of the SR 99 Tunnel. With the completion of the
Mercer East Project, peak hour traffic patterns in the South Lake Union neighborhood to and
from I-5 and Downtown have shifted due to the two-way traffic.

Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program is currently under construction and is
anticipated to be completed and open to vehicles by the development’s horizon year. The
project will provide a two-mile long tunnel and connect S Royal Brougham Way in SODO to
Mercer Street near the proposed development project. The tunnel will replace the existing
Alaskan Way Viaduct and Broad Street tunnel and will connect to the existing SR 99 roadway
on the north and south ends. Within the study area the North Portal of SR 99 will be
constructed, providing access to and from SR 99 via Republican Street and Mercer Street/6th
Avenue N. In addition, the project includes reconnection of John, Thomas and, Harrison
Streets, which are bisected by SR 99.

Traffic Volumes
The following sections document the development of the traffic volumes used in the existing
and future without-project operations analysis.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown in
Figure 3. Traffic counts were collected at the study intersections and study driveways in
July 2014. Detailed intersection traffic counts are provided in Appendix A. Traffic volumes
were rounded to the nearest five vehicles since weekday volumes fluctuate day-to-day.

Future Without-Project Volumes
Due to the anticipated change in travel patterns with the completion of the two-way Mercer
Corridor project as well as the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program, the future 2030
forecast from the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Project Final Environment Impact
Statement (FEIS) TDR (Appendix C), Parsons Brinkerhoff, July 2011 were used as a basis
for developing 2018 forecasts1. These volumes reflect changes in roadway configurations
and volume shifts that will occur with the completion of the improvement projects in the study
area. The 2030 forecasts were adjusted to 2018 (year of opening) by reducing 2030 forecasts
traffic volumes by one percent per year consistent with recent traffic studies conducted in the
surrounding vicinity. The forecasts were adjusted along Harrison and Thomas Streets to
account for balancing in the site vicinity; these adjustments account for land uses and
developments in the site vicinity that was likely unknown at the time of the Viaduct FEIS. In
addition, anticipated traffic from “pipeline development” (i.e., approved or planned
development in the study area) was added to the background forecasts. It is likely that the
2030 forecasts already account for some of the land use associated with the pipeline
developments, but 2030 forecasts were not reduced providing a conservative estimate of
future traffic volumes.

The following pipeline development was considered as part of the future forecasting.
        8th and Republican (DPD Project 3014781): 210 apartment units and an expansion
         of the existing camera store on the ground floor of the building
        325 9th Avenue N (DPD Project 3014639): 307,604 square-feet of office space
         above 4,210 square-feet of retail at street level
        400 9th Avenue N (DPD Project 3014653): 296,651 square-feet of office with 3,813
         square-feet of retail use at street level
        777 Thomas Street (DPD Project 3014045): 174 residential units with 5,035 square-
         feet of retail at street level
        300 8th Avenue (DPD Project 3014981): 194,400 square-foot office building
        333 8th Avenue (DPD Project 3014982): 194,400 square-foot office building

After adding in pipeline project trips, the forecasted total entering volumes at the intersections
are 20 to 120 percent higher than observed in existing counts based on the change in travel
patterns in the area as shown in the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Project Final
Environment Impact Statement (FEIS). Future 2018 traffic volumes for the study intersections
are shown on Figure 4.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections, like the access alleys, LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle
during the peak hour of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the
intersection. Traffic operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a
range of levels of service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and
LOS F indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 8 software program.
Results are summarized in Table 2. This methodology is consistent with the Mercer Corridor
and Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program transportation evaluations. Detailed LOS
worksheets for each intersection analysis are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, during the weekday PM peak hour the three signalized intersections
currently operate at LOS C or better and the stop controlled intersection, 9th Avenue N /
Thomas Street, operates at LOS D. In 2018, after completion of the major infrastructure
projects in the study area and with the anticipated change in travel patterns, the three
signalized intersection are forecast to continue to operate at LOS C or better. The 9th Avenue
N / Thomas Street is forecast to degrade from LOS D to LOS E on the eastbound approach
under future without project conditions during the weekday PM peak hour.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three year summary of accident data from
SDOT is for the period between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. In addition to the
intersections, collision data along the roadways fronting the project were analyzed to evaluate
the safety of the project driveways and pedestrian/bicycle safety. This information is
summarized in Table 3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high accident location status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. Table 3 shows that the study
intersections averaged 3 or fewer collisions per year. The most frequent collision type at the
study intersections involved angle collisions followed by approach turn collisions and
pedestrian or bicycle collisions. None of the collisions during the three year period had
fatalities.


Transit Service
Transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit. The nearest bus
stop is located near the corner of Westlake Avenue N / Harrison Street, with the next closest
stop located near the intersection of Dexter Avenue N / Harrison Street. Both of these transit
stops are located less than two blocks from the proposed project site. The following transit
routes operate within the project vicinity and serve the transit stops near the project site.

Route 26 operates between Downtown Seattle and Greenlake via Dexter Avenue N in the
project vicinity. The nearest bus stop to the proposed project is located on Dexter Avenue N
at Harrison Street. The route runs seven days a week with service from approximately 5:00
AM to 2:00 AM on weekdays and 6:30 AM to 2:00 AM on weekends. During the weekday AM
and PM peak commute periods, the bus operates with headways ranging between six and
thirty minutes.

Route 28 operates between Downtown Seattle and Broadview via Fremont and Whittier
Heights. Near the proposed project, the route operates along Dexter Avenue N with the
nearest stop located at Harrison Street. The route runs seven days a week with service from
approximately 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM on weekday and between from 6:00 AM to 1:00 AM on
weekends. During the weekday AM and PM peak commute periods, the bus runs with
arrivals every fifteen to thirty minutes.

Route 40 operates between Downtown Seattle and Northgate via Ballard and Crown Hill. In
the project study area, the route operates on 9th Avenue N and Westlake Avenue N. The
route runs seven days a week with service from approximately 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM on
weekdays and with slightly shorter service on weekends. The route operates with
approximately 15 minute intervals during the weekday peak hours with 30 to 60 minute
headways early in the morning and late in the evening. The nearest stop to the proposed
project is located on Harrison Street at Westlake Avenue N.

Route 62 operates between Downtown Seattle and Ballard via 9th and Westlake Avenues N
in the project study area. The route operates weekdays as a commuter route with service to
Ballard between approximately 6:00 and 9:00 AM and to Downtown between 2:00 and 5:00
PM. The route operates with approximately 25 to 40 minute headways during the weekday
peak hours. The nearest stop to the proposed project is located on Mercer Street at 9th
Avenue N.

Additionally, the South Lake Union line of the Seattle Streetcar operates along Westlake
Avenue N approximately two blocks from the proposed project. The streetcar provides
service between Fairview Avenue N along Lake Union and Westlake Center in Downtown.
The streetcar operates on 15 minute headways and provides access to commercial, office
and residential land uses along its route.


Non-Motorized Transportation Facilities
Based on the Seattle Bicycling Guide Map (2012), published by the SDOT, three streets with
striped bicycle lanes are located within one block of the proposed project site. Dexter Avenue N
is a major north-south bicycle street that provides striped and buffered bicycle lanes between
Fremont and Downtown. There are plans to connect the buffered Dexter Avenue N bicycle
lanes to a proposed cycle track on 7th Avenue which will further enhance bicycle comfort and
connectivity. Striped bicycle lanes along 9th Avenue N also enable greater mobility through
South Lake Union, the Denny Triangle, and Downtown areas.

Sidewalks are provided on both sides of streets in the project vicinity. At intersections with
traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks and crossing signals are provided to enhance
pedestrian connectivity.

                                      Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
roadway network and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated by the
proposed project are distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within
the study area for the weekday PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-
project traffic volumes and the potential impact to traffic operations, safety, non-motorized
facilities, and transit are identified. Site-specific items are also discussed such as the traffic
operations of the site’s alley access and estimated on-site parking demand.


Trip Generation
In order to estimate the proposed project’s trip generation, weekday daily and PM peak hour
person trip rates were estimated for the proposed land uses. Initial vehicle trip rates were
identified using the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition (2012). The methodology used in this analysis has been approved by City staff and is
consistent with previous studies conducted in the area. The flow chart below illustrates the
trip generation process.

Some ITE land uses represent vehicle trip rates observed in more suburban settings than the
proposed project. To calibrate the trip generation to the local character of the proposed
project, the vehicle trips based on ITE trip rates are converted to person trips through the use
of average vehicle occupancy (AVO) rates derived from NCHRP Report 365. Once person
trips were derived, local mode split information, from American Community Survey (ACS)
data2 and previous studies conducted for similar developments in South Lake Union, was
applied to arrive at transit, non-motorized, carpool and single occupant vehicles (SOV) trips.

Person trips by mode were determined by multiplying the person trips by the estimated mode
splits. Table 4 shows the resulting weekday daily and PM peak hour vehicle trip generation.

1.     Trip generation based on ITE Trip Generation (9th Edition, 2012) and 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-year estimates
       for the project’s census tract (#72) to estimate mode split to the existing and proposed study area.


As shown in the Table 4, the development is anticipated to generate 810net new vehicular
weekday daily trips with 74 trips occurring during an average weekday PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based primarily on
guidance from the Director’s Rule 5-2009 as well as a review of existing travel patterns,
planned improvements, and previous studies conducted in the area. Figure 5 shows the
expected project distribution to the surrounding local and regional street system.
The weekday PM peak hour trips were assigned to the study area based on the travel
patterns and the location of the site access. At the alley access locations, the gross trip
generation of the proposed development was assigned to account for all vehicles entering the
site. It was assumed that a majority of the project traffic would be oriented to and from
Harrison Street given the location of the proposed project site access in the alley. The project
generated traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes
to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2018 with-project traffic volumes
are shown on Figure 6.

As shown in Table 5, the traffic volume impacts are relatively low at the offsite intersections.
The traffic volumes are anticipated to increase by 2 percent or less, which falls within the
range of typical day-to-day fluctuations in traffic volumes. Traffic volumes typically fluctuate
day-to-day depending on factors such as the day of the week, weather conditions, and traffic
conditions elsewhere in the roadway network.


Traffic Operations Impact
A future with-project level-of-service analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour
to analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methodologies were applied as
described for existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters
such as channelization and intersection control were consistent with those used in the
evaluation of future without-project conditions. A comparison of 2018 horizon year future
without-project and future with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is
summarized in Table 6. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

During the weekday PM peak hour, the addition of with-project traffic results in only minimal
increase in delay at the study intersections. All offsite intersections are forecast to operate at
the same LOS in without-project as with-project conditions. Average vehicle delay is
anticipated to increase by approximately 1 second or less at all study intersections. The
midblock alleys that serve as access to the project garage are both anticipated to operate at
LOS B during the weekday PM peak hour.

Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that were
analyzed for concurrency review include South of Lake Union (Screenline 8) and East of CBD
(Screenline 12.12), as shown in Table 7. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all
project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the screenlines would extend across the
screenlines included in this analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus, the
project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following describes the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking demand of the
project, and parking code requirements.

Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by an on-site parking garage with 163
vehicle parking stalls. In addition, 84 long-term and 4 short-term bicycle spaces would also be
provided in or near the proposed garage. The parking garage would be accessed via the
alley between 9th and Westlake Avenues N with the driveway to the garage located
approximately 60 feet south of Harrison Street.

Demand
The anticipated parking demand of the proposed development was estimated based on data
provided in Urban Land Institute’s (ULI) Shared Parking, 2nd Edition and local vehicle
ownership data for the project’s census tract3. An analysis was completed to estimate the
approximate parking demand of the proposed development.

The peak parking demand for the apartment uses are expected to be below national
averages due the project’s proximity to transit service and its location in a high-density urban
center with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The parking rate used
to estimate the peak parking demand for the apartments is based on average vehicle

ownership4 from US Census data and visitor demand based on parking rates from ULI’s
Shared Parking.5 Based on the proposed mix of apartment units,6 a parking rate of 0.44
vehicles per dwelling unit was used for tenants, which results in a parking demand of 142
vehicles.

The ULI apartment visitor parking demand rate is 0.15 vehicles per units; this results in 49
vehicles associated with visitors. The demand rate is based on a suburban multifamily
apartment setting and is likely conservative based on the proximity of transit and bicycle
facilities to the proposed project. The visitor peak parking demand is likely to peak in the
evening around 8 p.m.

Peak parking demand for the on-site retail was also calculated using ULI Shared Parking.
Similar to the Trip Generation rates, the data from Shared Parking is based on sites located
in suburban settings that have limited transit and non-motorized transportation opportunities.
Since the project is located in an urban center and a proportion of trips to the project are
anticipated to be non-motorized or transit, the vehicle parking demand for the retail use will
also be reduced. The same vehicle reduction taken for the trip generation was applied to the
parking demand calculation. The estimated peak parking demand for the retail use is 4
vehicles.

A summary of the anticipated parking demand for each of the proposed land uses is included
in Table 8. Detailed parking demand calculations are provided in Appendix E.

As shown in Table 8, the total parking demand for the proposed development is 193 vehicles.
With a proposed parking supply of 163 vehicle spaces on site, the anticipated demand of the
project is forecast to exceed the provided parking supply by approximately 30 vehicles. The
anticipated parking demand for the apartment tenants and retail spaces are forecast to be
accommodated within the on-site parking garage; however, the demand for visitors to the
apartment demand will likely not be accommodated in the proposed garage and would need
to be accommodated off-site.

Based on Shared Parking, visitor parking demand is anticipated to peak from 7 – 10 p.m. The
excess visitor parking demand that would not be accommodated in the on-site garage would
likely use on-street parking spaces and public, off-street garages. On-street parking within
two-blocks west of the project is generally utilized around 70 percent or less in the evening
around 8 p.m. Many public off-site parking lots are also open to the public and available

          proposed project.
     2.   Existing parking demand counted at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on a typical weekday in July 2014.


Based on the existing parking demand observed in the public off-street lots, the anticipated
visitor parking demand of 49 vehicles could be accommodated. In the 3 lots surveyed, there
is an existing excess supply of 266 spaces during the 7 p.m. hour and 284 spaces during the
9 p.m. hour. With the addition of the anticipated project related visitor parking demand, the
garages are anticipated to continue to have over 200 available spaces during both time
periods.
Parking Code Analysis
As noted previously, the project includes 163 garage parking spaces for the residential and
retail uses. Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there are no automobile parking
requirements for the development as it is located within an urban center.

Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

SMC Section 23.54.015, Row K, Table E outlines the bicycle parking siting and quantity
requirements. The code requires a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for short-term
(less than 4 hours) and long-term (more than 4 hours) use. Since the vehicular parking for
this project is provided in a covered, below grade garage all long-term bicycle parking must
also be covered. The 8,487 square foot retail area requires at least 1 secured, long-term
parking spaces to be provided for employees and at least 5 easily-accessible spaces for retail
customers. Bicycle parking for residential uses is required to be located on-site and secured.
Based on the project size, the proposed project is required to provide 81 long-term bicycle
parking spots for residential tenants. This results in a total of 82 long-term bicycle parking
spaces required on-site and 4 easily-accessible short-term spaces. The garage is planned to
have at least 84 long-term spaces which meets the code requirement

                 Mitigation and Recommendations
Traffic volume and operations impacts of the proposed development are anticipated to be
minimal. To mitigate impacts of the proposal on the surrounding transportation system, the
developer would be required to pay the South Lake Union transportation mitigation payment.
The City has implemented a program in and around the South Lake Union neighborhood that
requires new developments to contribute towards planned improvements identified in the
South Lake Union Transportation Plan. Improvements in this transportation plan include a
combination of vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects located in the neighborhood
which would benefit all users. The development mitigation payment schedule is set forth by
DPD’s Tip #243 – Transportation Mitigation Payments. The developer is opting to pay based
on a pro-rata share calculation, which is based on the number of weekday PM peak hour trips
using the South Lake Union infrastructure. This mitigation fee is estimated to be $52,629, as
shown in Appendix F. This fee is a preliminary calculation and will be finalized by the City
upon approval of the proposed project.

                         Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with of the mixed-use
development located at 9th and Harrison Street in the South Lake Union neighborhood of
Seattle. General findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would develop up to 318 apartment units along with
           approximately 10,500 square feet of retail. This development is anticipated to be
           constructed and occupied by 2018.
          After accounting for the existing uses on the project site, the development is
           anticipated to generate 810 net new vehicular weekday daily trips, with 74 new trips
           occurring during the weekday PM peak hour.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via the alley located
           between 9th and Westlake Avenues N, approximately 60 feet south of Harrison
           Street. Both alley site accesses would operate at LOS B during the weekday PM
           peak hour with the addition of project generated traffic. The nearest off-site
           intersections would continue to operate at same LOS during the weekday PM peak
           hour for future conditions without and with the project.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The proposed parking garage with a minimum of 163 vehicle parking stalls would
           accommodate the anticipated peak parking demand of the residential tenants and
           retail components of the project. Visitors to the proposed development would be
           accommodated in adjacent on-street parking or public, off-street lots.
          The developer would be required to pay a transportation mitigation fee. The
           projected mitigation fee is $52,629 based on the project’s calculated pro-rata share.

Appendix B:   LOS Definitions
Highway Capacity Manual, 2010

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying
several intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time.
Specifically, LOS criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified
time period (for example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on
many variables, including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the
intersection), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity.
Table 1 shows LOS criteria for signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010).

    Service               (sec/veh)                (Signalized Intersections)
        A                      10                 Free Flow
        B                   >10 - 20               Stable Flow (slight delays)
        C                   >20 - 35               Stable flow (acceptable delays)
        D                                          Approaching unstable flow (tolerable delay, occasionally wait
                            >35 - 55
                                                   through more than one signal cycle before proceeding)
        E                   >55 - 80               Unstable flow (intolerable delay)
        F                      >80                 Forced flow (jammed)

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types:
all-way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS
is expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of
a signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a
two-way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual
movements, rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-
controlled intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total
average vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized
intersections (both all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).
