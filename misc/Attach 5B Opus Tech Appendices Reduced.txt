 • Install base rock at entryways for all exiting trucks, and wash off the tires or tracks of
    all trucks and equipment in designated areas before leaving the site; and
 • Suspend excavation and grading activity when sustained wind speeds exceed 25 mph.
    Sustained wind speed shall be determined by averaging observed values over a two-
    minute period. Wind monitoring by the construction manager shall be required at all
    times during excavation and grading activities.

  IV. Biological Resources
 BIO-1a: Prior to initiation of grading and construction activities, a temporary construction                        Project Applicant/     Brisbane Public Works     Prior to initiation of
 fence shall be placed along the western edge of the project site along the row of toyon trees                       Qualified Biologist    Department                grading or construction
 to restrict access of construction personnel and equipment into the salt marsh and drainage.                                                                         activities
 A qualified biologist will assist construction personnel in the placement of the construction
 fencing and will monitor the site periodically during project construction.
 BIO-1b: The project applicant shall construct a permanent fence adjacent to the pedestrian                          Project Applicant/     Brisbane Planning        Prior to issuance of a
 path and Bay Trail along the western and northern edge of the project site to restrict access                       Qualified Biologist    Department/San Francisco certificate of occupancy
 of humans and dogs into the salt marsh. A qualified biologist shall advise the applicant                                                   Bay Conservation and     permit for Phase 1
 regarding the location and design of the fence. The applicant shall receive approval of fence                                              Development Commission
 design, dimensions and location from BCDC and the Planning Department. The upland
 habitat on the project site should be landscaped with native shrub species such as marsh
 gum plant, salt grass, California sagebrush, and/or coyote brush to buffer the small marsh
 from activity on the pathway and provide rails and other marsh birds with shelter during
 extreme high tides. Such vegetation (e.g., marsh gum-plant) could also provide potential
 nesting habitat for various species of bird inhabiting the marsh. In the unlikely event that
 California black rails occur in the salt marsh, the mitigation measures outlined for
 California clapper rails would also protect black rails. Implementation of this two-part
 mitigation measure would reduce indirect impacts to California clapper rails to less-than-
 significant levels.
 BIO-2a: Conduct pile-driving activities for the proposed project during the non-breeding                            Project Applicant/     Brisbane Planning         During the construction
 season of the California clapper rail, September 1 through January 15. Pile-driving during                          Construction Manager   Department/Public Works   period
 this time frame would not impact the nesting activity of clapper rails if they are present in                                              Department
 the small salt marsh adjacent to the project site and would reduce potential indirect impacts
 to California clapper rails to less-than-significant levels.

 enhanced protocol level surveys (i.e., protocol survey plus 2 to 3 additional surveys) of the
 adjacent salt marsh prior to pile driving activities, the establishment of appropriate buffer
 areas, and the use of pile driving techniques that minimize noise and vibrations. The pile
 driving plan, schedule and any alternative mitigations or solutions that are developed as a
 result of early consultations, must be reviewed and approved in writing by the CDFG,
 USFWS and the City of Brisbane’s Community Development Director prior to issuance of a
 building permit to allow pile driving.
 BIO-3a: Comprehensive pre-construction surveys for burrowing owl presence shall be                                  Project Applicant/     Brisbane Planning        Prior to issuance of

 accordance with current California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) burrowing owl
 survey protocol (CDFG, October 17, 1995). A qualified biologist shall conduct surveys for
 burrowing owls in all suitable habitats on the site. Surveys shall be conducted regardless of
 season, as suitable habitat on-site may be used at all times of the year. A report shall be
 prepared at the end of each construction season detailing the results of the pre-construction
 surveys. The report shall be submitted to the CDFG by November 30 of each year.
 BIO-3b: If burrowing owls are found on the site, CDFG shall be notified and a qualified                             Project Applicant/     Brisbane Planning        CDFG clearance required

 prior to the start of construction. Impacts to active nests will be avoided by establishing an
 exclusion zone 25-foot buffer around the active nest. Due to the relatively high levels of
 local ambient noise and disturbance and the likely acclimation of local nesting birds a 25-
 foot buffer is deemed adequate to protect nest sites. A qualified biologist will monitor each
 nest once per week in order to track the status of each nest and inform the project applicant
 of when a nest area has been cleared for construction. To avoid impacts to birds nesting in
 the salt marsh and drainage to the west of the project area construction fencing shall be
 placed along the eastern edge of the fringing vegetation (including the planted toyon) to

 TRAF-5: In accordance with CMP requirements, the project applicant shall identify and            Project Applicant      Brisbane Planning         Prior to issuance of
 implement Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures to reduce project impacts and                                         Department/County         building permit
 shall ensure that the TDM measures are implemented by the project applicant or tenants, per                             Congestion Management

 timing. A list of TDM measures are provided in the San Mateo County Final Congestion
 Management Program. In coordination with the City and prior to issuance of a building
 permit, the applicant shall prepare and provide the City with a Traffic Reduction Plan that
 identifies specific TDM measures to be implemented. Specific measures that could be
 included in the Plan to reduce trips associated with the project are listed below:
 • Provide for increased frequencies of existing dedicated shuttle service during the peak
     period to a rail station or residential area; coordinate with Caltrain shuttle services with
     respect to locations of stops and related amenities;
 • Participate in City programs (when and if they are available) aimed at reducing
     vehicular traffic trips;
 • Provide a location for a dedicated shuttle stop;
 • Provide secure bicycle parking;
 • Provide and operate an on-site commute assistance center to allow for one stop
     shopping for transit and commute alternatives information, preferably staffed with a
     live person to assist building tenants with trip planning;
 • Provide subsidized transit passes;
 • Provide less parking, charge for parking, and offer employees a parking cash-out
     program; and
 • Implement an alternate hours workweek program, also known as flextime.

 While implementation of this mitigation measure would reduce the impact, mitigation
 measures, involving implementation of TDM measures are typically designed to achieve a
 10 to 20 percent traffic reduction. Even if these reductions could be achieved, the freeway
 segments could continue to operate above the CMP threshold for significant impacts. The
 measure would not reduce impacts to a less-than-significant level in the cumulative
 condition and this impact would remain significant and unavoidable.
 TRAF-6: The mitigation necessary to reduce significant impacts on freeways is the             Project Applicant         Brisbane Public Works    NA
 widening of the freeway. Due to the substantial cost, this measure is not considered feasible                           Department/City Engineer

 two separate locations in accordance with Public Works Department and Fire Authority
 specifications. Each fire supply loop connection to the street main shall include a double
 detector check valve. A fire loop system separated from the potable water system will allow
 for smaller water mains to serve the peak daily demand for the project, thereby allowing for
 quicker water turnover in the potable water system. Separate potable and fire supply
 systems will also allow for maintenance on either looped system without affecting the other.
 The separate potable water service shall be looped by connecting directly into the street
 main at two separate metered locations.

 As an alternative, the applicant could submit a proposal for a dual-use fire/potable water
 loop but, as part of such a submittal, must provide sufficient evidence (e.g., hydraulic
 calculations) to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, that the water would not stagnate in
 such a dual-use system and that the impact would be mitigated to a less-than-significant
 level.

MEMORANDUM



DATE:              December 7, 2016

SUBJECT:           Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis for the Opus Office Center Project


LSA Associates, Inc. (LSA) has prepared this memorandum to provide the City of Brisbane (City)
with the potential greenhouse gas emission impacts associated with the Opus Office Center Project
(proposed project).

PROJECT INFORMATION
The Opus Office Center Project would include the development and construction of an office center
with two office buildings totaling 445,000 square feet, a five-level parking garage with 1,175 parking
spaces, and a surface parking lot with 213 parking spaces on an 8.87-acre site located at 3000-3500
Marina Boulevard (Assessor’s Parcel Number 007-165-020). The site is designated as Parcel 3 on the
Sierra Point peninsula in the City of Brisbane and is located on the northwestern portion of the
peninsula. It is bounded by U.S. Highway 101(US 101) to the west, the San Francisco Bay to the
north, and office buildings and parking to the east and south. Primary access to the project site is
provided from Marina Boulevard via Sierra Point Parkway.

The project also includes grading and capping of a Class III landfill and various landscape
improvements on the site, including landscaping along the street and Bay Trail and internal pedestrian
trail, outdoor plazas, building entrances, and surface parking areas. A pedestrian path would partially
circumscribe the parcel along the northern, western, and southern portions of the site and would
connect to the sidewalk along Marina Parkway.

The Opus Office Center Project was previously evaluated under the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) in the November 2008 Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (2008 IS/MND). 1
The proposed project involves minor modifications to the project evaluated in the 2008 IS/MND
(original project). The proposed project would include development of the original project to LEED
Gold Standards and installation of solar panels on the top floor of the parking garage. In addition, the
proposed project would include the transfer of development rights of the Parcel R site from the
developer to the City of Brisbane.

The 2008 IS/MND included a discussion of the project’s greenhouse gas emissions in Section III. Air
Quality. However, at the time the 2008 IS/MND was prepared, no applicable numeric thresholds had
yet been defined. Therefore, this memorandum was prepared consistent with CEQA Guidelines §
15064.4 and evaluates the impacts of project-related greenhouse gas emissions based on the guidance
in the Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s (BAAQMD’s) May 2011 CEQA Guidelines.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Greenhouse gas emissions are present in the atmosphere naturally, are released by natural sources, or
are formed from secondary reactions taking place in the atmosphere. The gases that are widely seen
as the principal contributors to human-induced global climate change are:
       •    Carbon dioxide (CO2);
       •    Methane (CH4);
       •    Nitrous oxide (N2O);
       •    Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);
       •    Perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and
       •    Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6).

Over the last 200 years, humans have caused substantial quantities of greenhouse gases to be released
into the atmosphere. These extra emissions are increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere and enhancing the natural greenhouse effect, which is believed to be causing global
warming. While manmade greenhouse gases include naturally-occurring greenhouse gases such as
CO2, methane, and N2O, some gases, like HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 are completely new to the
atmosphere.

Certain gases, such as water vapor, are short-lived in the atmosphere. Others remain in the
atmosphere for significant periods of time, contributing to climate change in the long term. Water
vapor is excluded from the list of greenhouse gases above because it is short-lived in the atmosphere
and its atmospheric concentrations are largely determined by natural processes, such as oceanic
evaporation.

These gases vary considerably in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), which is a concept
developed to compare the ability of each greenhouse gas to trap heat in the atmosphere relative to
another gas. The GWP is based on several factors, including the relative effectiveness of a gas to
absorb infrared radiation and length of time that the gas remains in the atmosphere (“atmospheric
lifetime”). The GWP of each gas is measured relative to CO2, the most abundant greenhouse gas; the
definition of GWP for a particular greenhouse gas is the ratio of heat trapped by one unit mass of the
greenhouse gas to the ratio of heat trapped by one unit mass of CO2 over a specified time period.
Greenhouse gas emissions are typically measured in terms of pounds or tons of “CO2 equivalents”
(CO2e).


REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
State Laws and Regulations
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, best known by Assembly Bill (AB) 32,
created a first-in-the-country comprehensive program to achieve real, quantifiable, and cost-effective
reductions in greenhouse gases. The law set an economy-wide cap on the State’s greenhouse gas
emissions at 1990 levels by 2020. It directed the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to prepare,
approve, and implement a Scoping Plan for achieving the maximum technologically feasible and
cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Executive Order (EO) S-20-06, signed in



12/9/16 (P:\BRI1601 Opus Office Park ISMND\PRODUCTS\Addendum IS\Screen\Appendices\GHG memo_Revised.docx)   2
                                                        G.1.94

October 2006, directed the Secretary for Environmental Protection to establish a Market Advisory
Committee of national and international experts. The committee made recommendations to the ARB
on the design of a market-based program for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The ARB adopted
the first Scoping Plan, which described a portfolio of measures to achieve the target, in December
2008. 2 Based on the Scoping Plan reduction goals, a 29 percent reduction in greenhouse gas levels
relative to a “business-as-usual” (BAU) scenario would be required to meet 1990 levels by 2020. The
Scoping Plan further recommended that local governments establish a State-aligned reduction goal of
15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below current (2010) levels by 2020.

The ARB approved the First Update to the Climate Change Scoping Plan on May 22, 2014, which is
currently underway. The First Update identifies opportunities to leverage existing and new funds to
further drive greenhouse gas emission reductions through strategic planning and targeted low carbon
investments. The First Update defines ARB’s climate change priorities until 2020, and also sets the
groundwork to reach long-term goals set forth in Executive Orders S-3-05 and B-16-2012. The
Update highlights California’s progress toward meeting the “near-term” 2020 greenhouse gas
emission reduction goals as defined in the initial Scoping Plan. It also evaluates how to align the
State’s “longer-term” greenhouse gas reduction strategies with other State policy priorities for water,
waste, natural resources, clean energy, transportation, and land use. The ARB is moving forward with
a second update to the Scoping Plan to reflect the 2030 target established in Executive Order B-30-15.

On April 29, 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued EO B-30-15 to establish a California
greenhouse gas reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. EO B-30-15 aligned
California’s greenhouse gas reduction targets with those of leading international governments ahead
of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris that was scheduled for late 2015. EO B-
30-15 sets a new interim statewide greenhouse gas emission reduction target to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 in order to ensure California meets its target
of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and directs the ARB
to update the Climate Change Scoping Plan to express the 2030 target in terms of million metric tons
of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2e). EO B-30-15 also requires the State’s climate adaptation
plan to be updated every 3 years and for the State to continue its climate change research program,
among other provisions. As with EO S-3-05, EO B-30-15 is not legally enforceable against local
governments and the private sector. Legislation that would update AB 32 to make post-2020 targets
and requirements a mandate is in process in the State Legislature.

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. signed Senate Bill (SB) 350 350 Clean Energy and Pollution
Reduction Act on October 7, 2015 to update and enhance AB 32 by introducing the following set of
objectives in clean energy, clean air, and pollution reduction for 2030: raise California’s renewable
portfolio standard from 33 percent to 50 percent; and increase energy efficiency in buildings by 50
percent by the year 2030. The 50 percent renewable energy standard will be implemented by the CA
Public Utilities Commission for the private utilities and by the CA Energy Commission for municipal
utilities. Each utility must submit a procurement plan showing it will purchase clean energy to
displace other non-renewable resources. The 50 percent increase in energy efficiency in buildings
must be achieved through the use of existing energy efficiency retrofit funding and regulatory tools
already available to State energy agencies under existing law. The addition made by this legislation

requires State energy agencies to plan for, and implement those programs in a manner that achieves
the energy efficiency target.

Local Laws and Regulations
The City of Brisbane regulates greenhouse gas emission through implementation of the City’s
Climate Action Plan (CAP), adopted September 17, 2015. 3 The primary goal of the CAP is to reduce
the City of Brisbane’s greenhouse gas emissions to comply with AB 32. The CAP outlines specific
actions, called “measures” that seek to reduce Brisbane’s greenhouse gas emissions. The measures in
the CAP relate to energy, water use, solid waste, and road emissions/transportation. These measures
are assumed to lead to specific, quantifiable reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.

The City of Brisbane CAP includes an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. The inventory
quantifies greenhouse gas emissions from a wide variety of sources and is arranged by sector to
facilitate detailed analyses of emissions sources. In the base year of 2005, the City of Brisbane
emitted approximately 70,946 metric tons CO2e from the residential, commercial, industrial,
transportation, waste, and municipal sectors. The largest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions are
from the transportation sector, approximately 51 percent, followed by the commercial/industrial
sector and the solid waste sector, approximately 33 percent and 8 percent respectively. The residential
sector accounts for approximately 8 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

Based on the 2005 emissions inventories, the City projected a forecast of future emissions for the year
2020. The emission forecast represents a “business-as-usual” prediction of how greenhouse gas
emissions would grow in the absence of a greenhouse gas policy. The business-as-usual greenhouse
gas emissions for the year 2020 were projected to be approximately 74,180 metric tons CO2e, which
is an increase of 4.6 percent over the 2005 emission inventory. The City’s reduction goal is to reduce
community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by at least 15 percent by 2020, which is a reduction of
13,876 metric tons of CO2e.

THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
A single project typically does not generate a sufficient quantity of greenhouse gas emissions to affect
global climate change; therefore, the global climate change impacts of the proposed project are
discussed in the context of cumulative impacts, following the approach recommended by the
BAAQMD. This section establishes the thresholds to determine whether an impact is significant.

The State CEQA Guidelines indicate that a project would normally have a significant adverse green-
house gas emission impact if the project would:
         •   Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant
             impact on the environment; or
         •   Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reduction
             the emissions of greenhouse gases.

The BAAQMD has further defined these criteria of significance to indicate the project would result in
a less-than-significant greenhouse gas impact if it would:

       •    Result in operational-related greenhouse gas emissions of less than 1,100 metric tons of
            CO2e a year, or
       •    Result in operational-related greenhouse gas emissions of less than 4.6 metric tons of CO2e
            per service population (residents plus employees).

In June 2010, BAAQMD adopted updated draft CEQA Air Quality Guidelines and finalized them in
May 2011. These guidelines superseded previously adopted agency air quality guidelines of 1999 and
were intended to advise lead agencies on how to evaluate potential air quality impacts.

In late 2010, the Building Industry Association filed a lawsuit in Alameda Superior Court,
challenging BAAQMD’s CEQA Guidelines on the grounds that the agency did not comply with
CEQA. On March 5, 2012, the Alameda County Superior Court issued a judgment finding that the
BAAQMD had failed to comply with CEQA when it adopted the thresholds of significance in the
BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines. The court did not determine whether the thresholds of
significance were valid on their merits, but found that the adoption of the thresholds was a project
under CEQA. The court issued a writ of mandate ordering the BAAQMD to set aside the thresholds
and cease dissemination of them until the BAAQMD complied with CEQA. In May of 2012, the
BAAQMD filed an appeal of the court’s decision. In August of 2013 the First District Court of
Appeal overturned the trial court and held that the thresholds of significance were not subject to
CEQA review. The Court of Appeal's decision was appealed to the California Supreme Court, which
granted limited review.

On December 21, 2015, the California Supreme Court rejected the BAAQMD’s requirement for a so-
called reverse CEQA analysis, and concluded that CEQA does not generally require a lead agency to
consider the effects of existing environmental conditions on a proposed project’s future residents. The
Court also noted that while assessing the impacts of the environment on the project is not required by
CEQA, this approach is not prohibited when the lead agency proposes to undertake its own project.

The BAAQMD has not yet revised the 2011 Guidelines; however, the City supports continued use of
the BAAQMD’s greenhouse gas numeric thresholds for CEQA review of development projects,
which have been incorporated into this analysis for purposes of identifying significant air quality
impacts.

PROJECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
There are two aspects of the proposed project that would result in the emissions of greenhouse gases:
construction and operation. During construction of the project, greenhouse gas emissions would be
emitted through the operation of construction equipment and from worker and vendor vehicles, each
of which typically uses fossil-based fuels to operate. During operations, there would be many sources
of greenhouse gas emissions, including area sources (i.e. landscaping), energy consumption, on-road
transportation, solid waste, and water use. The California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod)
was used to estimate the project’s greenhouse gas emissions. Assumptions used in CalEEMod are
detailed in Attachment A of this letter report.

Construction Emissions
Construction activities associated with the proposed project would produce combustion emissions
from various sources. During construction, greenhouse gas emissions would be emitted through the



12/9/16 (P:\BRI1601 Opus Office Park ISMND\PRODUCTS\Addendum IS\Screen\Appendices\GHG memo_Revised.docx)   5
                                                        G.1.97

operation of construction equipment and from worker and builder supply vendor vehicles, each of
which typically use fossil-based fuels to operate. The combustion of fossil-based fuels creates
greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, and N2O. Furthermore, CH4 is emitted during the fueling of
heavy equipment. Exhaust emissions from on-site construction activities would vary daily as
construction activity levels change.

The BAAQMD does not have an adopted threshold of significance for construction-related
greenhouse gas emissions. However, lead agencies are encouraged to quantify and disclose
greenhouse gas emissions that would occur during construction.

Using CalEEMod, it is estimated that the project would generate approximately 738.9 metric tons of
CO2e during the construction period. Implementation of the BAAQMD Best Management Practices
construction emission control measures as identified as Mitigation Measure AIR-1 in the 2008
IS/MND would reduce greenhouse gas emissions during the construction period. 4

Operational Emissions
Long-term operation of the proposed project would generate greenhouse gas emissions from area and
mobile sources as well as indirect emissions from sources associated with energy consumption.
Mobile-source greenhouse gas emissions would include project-generated vehicle trips associated
with employee trips to the project site. Area-source emissions would be associated with activities
such as landscaping and maintenance of proposed land uses, and other sources.

Operational emissions estimates for the proposed project are discussed below and were calculated
using a method that is consistent with methodology recommended in the BAAQMD’s CEQA Air
Quality Guidelines, as described below.

        Methodology. The methodology and/or qualitative description of the sources of greenhouse
gas emissions associated with transportation, electricity, water use, and solid waste disposal are
described below.

        Transportation. Transportation associated with the proposed project would result in
greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in daily automobile and truck trips.
Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California and represents
approximately 38 percent of annual CO2 emissions in the State. For land use development projects,
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle trips are the most direct indicators of greenhouse gas
emissions associated with the proposed project. The proposed project is expected to generate
approximately 4,914 trips per day.

         Electricity and Natural Gas. Buildings represent 39 percent of United States primary energy
use and 70 percent of electricity consumption. 5 Electricity use can result in greenhouse gas production
if the electricity is generated by combusting fossil fuel. The project is anticipated to increase the use
of electricity and natural gas; however, as part of the project’s compliance with the latest California
building code standards, the project is expected to be relatively energy efficient. The project would
also install solar panels and would be developed to LEED Gold Standards.

          Water Use. Water and wastewater related greenhouse gas emissions are based on water
supply and conveyance, water treatment, water distribution, and wastewater treatment. Each element
of the water use cycle has unique energy intensities (kilowatt hours [kWh]/million gallons).
Recognizing that the actual energy intensity in each component of the water use cycle will vary by
utility, the California Energy Commission (CEC) assumes that approximately 3,950 kWh per million
gallons are consumed for water that is supplied, treated, consumed, treated again, and disposed of in
northern California.

        Solid Waste Disposal. Solid waste generated by the project could contribute to greenhouse
gas emissions in a variety of ways. Average waste generation rates from a variety of sources are
available from the California Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (Cal Recycle).6
Land filling and other methods of disposal use energy for transporting and managing the waste, and
these activities produce additional greenhouse gases to varying degrees. Land filling, the most
common waste management practice, results in the release of CH4 from the anaerobic decomposition
of organic materials. CH4 is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2. However, landfill CH4
can also be a source of energy. In addition, many materials in landfills do not decompose fully, and
the carbon that remains is sequestered in the landfill and not released into the atmosphere.

        Project Emissions. When calculating project greenhouse gas emissions to compare to the
thresholds of significance, the BAAQMD recommends that the lead agency consider project design
features, attributes, and local development requirements as part of the project as proposed and not as
mitigation measures. Consistent with BAAQMD guidance, greenhouse gas emissions were estimated
using CalEEMod.

Table 1 shows the calculated greenhouse gas emissions for the proposed project. Motor vehicle
emissions are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions for the project at approximately 71
percent of the total. Energy use is the next largest category at 21 percent of CO2e emissions. Water
and solid waste use are each about 4 percent of the total emissions. Additional calculation details are
iattached.

Based on the analysis results, the proposed project would generate 5,340.3 metric tons of CO2e per
year which would exceed the BAAQMD’s numeric threshold of 1,100 metric tons CO2e.

The proposed project includes construction of an office center with two office buildings totaling
445,000 square feet which would result in approximately 1,435 employees. The total service
population (residents plus employees) would be 1,435 people. 7 Therefore, the project’s greenhouse
gas emissions would result in a greenhouse gas efficiency of 3.7 metric tons CO2e per service
population, which is below the BAAQMD’s threshold of 4.6. According to the BAAQMD, a project
would have less-than-significant greenhouse gas emissions if it would meet one or more of the
criteria. The annual emissions would exceed the 1,100 meter tons CO2e threshold, but would meet the
threshold of 4.6 metric tons of CO2e per service population per year. Therefore, the proposed project
would not have a significant effect on the environment related to greenhouse gas emissions.

Compliance with the City of Brisbane Climate Action Plan
As discussed above, the City adopted a CAP that identified greenhouse gas emission reduction
measures. Consistency with the CAP can be determined if the project would support the goals of the
CAP, include applicable control measures, and would not disrupt or hinder implementations of any
control measures from the CAP. The project’s consistency with these objectives is described in Table
2 below.
