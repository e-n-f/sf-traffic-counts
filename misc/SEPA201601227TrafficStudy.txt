Phase 2: Traffic Impact Analysis – Redmond, WA                                              Alexan Central Park



 Executive Summary
 This report documents traffic conditions associated with development of Alexan Central Park (the
 Project), a proposed mid-rise apartment building located at 16160 NE 80th Street.
 The Project site is in Downtown Redmond within Town Square Zone. The underlying property is zoned
 for mixed-use development. The proposal includes redevelopment of two existing properties:
        16160 NE 80th Street (parcel no. 022505-9103), 7,467 sq. ft. Redmond General Insurance office
        8040 161st Avenue NE (parcel no. 022505-9179), 9,695 sq. ft. of strip mall retail
 The Project is proposed with 195 multifamily units, including four live-work units, within a mid-rise
 structure, 4,100 sq. ft. of dedicated street level commercial retail space, and onsite parking for 192
 vehicles. Garage access is proposed off the future extension of NE 81st Street, to the north of the
 property and between the site and the Veloce apartments. As part of this proposal NE 81st Street will
 be extended from its terminus, just west of 162nd Avenue NE, to 161st Avenue NE. The road extension
 will incorporate the existing garage access to Veloce.
 Site development is anticipated to be built-out and occupied by 2018.
 The Project generates:
        420 new daily trips, split 210 in and out;
        45 new PM peak hour trips split 33 in and 12 out.
 The study intersections operate within the City’s level of service threshold (LOS D).
 Vehicle queues are not projected to significantly affect traffic circulation with the Project.
 The onsite parking supply is sufficient to meet the needs of future tenants. A request for a variance
 from the City’s minimum parking requirements for multifamily uses was prepared on January 22, 2016.
 A Transportation Concurrency Application was prepared and submitted to the City on February 17,
 2016.
 Traffic impact fees will be computed and are due at the time of building permit issuance.




                                                                                         June 2016      1

 In total there were twenty three crashes between 2012 and 2015:
         No recent crashes were reported at the 164th Ave NE and NE 81st Street intersection.
         Rear end and pedestrian/bicyclist related crashes each made up 22% of the total crashes.
         Left turn, sideswipe and other crashes each made up 13% of the total crashes.
         Entering at angle crashes and crashes involving utility poles, sign posts or street light poles each
          made up 9% of the total crashes.
         About 57% of total crashes includes at least one possible or evident injury.
         No fatalities were reported.
 With future changes proposed on Redmond Way and Cleveland Street, conversion of both roadways
 from one-way to two-way traffic flow, traffic circulation through the downtown is forecast, by the City,
 to improve. Safety within the downtown should also benefit with improved traffic flow.




                                                                                        June 2016        7

 Forecasted Conditions
 Forecast Year
 The horizon year for this analysis is 2018. Year 2018 coincides with the anticipated full build-out and
 occupancy of the Project.
 General Traffic Growth
 Future year 2018 conditions include changes in traffic patterns generated by funded transportation
 facility improvements and non-Project-related traffic growth.
 The City’s 2016-2021 Six Year Transportation Improvement Program lists the following five planned
 public transportation improvements near the site:
        Cleveland Street East (164th Ave NE to Avondale Way) - Enhance pedestrian facilities and modify signals
         to complete buildout of Cleveland Street per the Downtown East West Corridor Study. Complete by 2021,
         unfunded. (Project ID. B43)
        159th Pl NE Sidewalk (Bear Creek Pkwy to Leary Way) – Construct sidewalk on 159th Place from Leary
         Way to Bear Creek Parkway. Complete by 2021, not fully funded. (Project ID. B47)
        Redmond Way and Cleveland Street Couplet Conversion (160th Ave NE to 170th Ave NE) – Convert
         Redmond Way to one through lane in each direction and center turn lane. Convert Cleveland Street to
         one through lane in each direction. A realignment of the streets at eastern and western ends will improve
         traffic flow and include gateway treatments. Pedestrian improvements will be constructed on Redmond
         Way. A BAT lane will be completed from the Bear Creek Bridge near SR 520 to 168th Ave with a queue
         jump at Avondale Way. Complete 2018, not fully funded. (Project ID. C53)
        NE 90th St Bridge Deck (along Sammamish River Trial) - Bridge deck preventative maintenance study.
         Construct per study (anticipating overlay). Complete 2021, unfunded. (Project ID. P20)

 In addition to the public improvements, the following private improvements will be implemented:
        162nd Ave NE Woonerf – 162nd Ave NE will be converted into a one-way southbound woonerf, or
         pedestrian oriented street, between NE 81st Street and NE 80th Street. The 162Ten developer is leading
         this road improvement which is anticipated to be complete by 2017.
        NE 81st Street Extension – This Project (Alexan Central Park) will extend NE 81st Street from its current
         terminus at 162nd Ave NE to 161st Ave NE, as a condition of approval. The new road will include 5 foot
         sidewalks with no curb and two ten foot drive lanes. The extension will function primarily as an access
         way. The new two-way road extension will require relocating the current Veloce apartment’s driveway
         south to the new local access road. The road extension is anticipated to be complete by 2018.

 The road improvements are incorporated into the future year 2018 conditions. A traffic model with year
 2016 conditions with the complete Redmond Way and Cleveland Street Couplet Conversion was
 provided by Redmond staff. The city’s model was adjusted manually to calibrate the existing volumes to
 with those modeled with the Couplet Conversion. Additionally, existing and Redmond modeled traffic
 volumes were increased by a 2% annual growth rate to adjusted the baseline conditions to year 2018.
 The NE 81st Street Extension shifts all Veloce trips from an existing midblock driveway to NE 81st Street.
 In addition, the extension allows Veloce traffic to head east on NE 81st Street to 162nd Ave NE, 164th
 Ave NE and NE 80th Street. The year 2018 without-Project conditions include reassignment of the PM
 peak hour trips generated by the Veloce apartments with the NE 81st Street extension complete.
 Figure 6 graphically illustrates the transportation facility improvements.

 Forecast of Development Generated Traffic Volumes
 Trip Generation
 Table 3 summarizes the trip generation forecast for the proposed Project and for the existing uses bring
 replaced by the Project. The trip generation forecast was based on data compiled in the ITE Trip
 Generation Manual, 9th Edition (2012). The project generates 420 new daily trips, split 210 in and out,
 and 45 new PM peak hour trips, split 33 in and 12 out.

 Trip Assignment
 The Project’s PM peak hour trips were distributed to the future roadway network based on feedback
 from City staff on the Phase 1: Trip Generation analysis. Figures 9 illustrate the trips generated by the
 existing uses on site, Project-generated trips, and net new trips within the study area.
 The net new PM peak hour trips were superimposed onto the without-Project volumes to project future
 2018 with-Project conditions. The future with-Project volumes are illustrated in Figure 10.

 Site Access
 Project access is on NE 81st Street and is forecast to operate at LOS B. Queues exiting the site are not
 significant and are not anticipated to impede the onsite circulation.
 Parking Requirements
 The Project proposes 192 onsite parking stalls. On street parking is available in the local area; however,
 these public stalls are not adjacent to the site. The Project proposes 195 multifamily units and 4,100 sq.
 ft. of commercial space. Table 7 summarizes the parking requirements.
 A parking variance was approved by Redmond Planning on February 3, 2016 to reduce the City’s
 multifamily parking requirement from 1.25 stalls per unit to 0.945 stalls per unit.
                                                                                                       June 2016     13

 It is noted that King County’s Right Size Parking recommendations, updated based on the current site
 plan, shows some additional flexibility with the 0.945 stalls per unit parking ratio. The Right Size Parking
 output, see Appendix, suggests the parking ratio for this particular site is 0.93 stalls per unit, or as low as
 0.81 stalls per unit if all of the onsite parking is unbundled, or separate from, the unit leases.

                  1.   Parking ratio approved by Redmond Planning Department


 The Project is proposed with 192 onsite parking stalls and will meets the parking requirements.
 Transit Service and Non-Motorized Facilities
 The Project is located in downtown and one block from the transit center. Daily transit ridership is
 projected to increase by 140 work-commuters and PM peak hour transit ridership is projected to
 increase by 14 work-commuters with the Project, refer to Table 4. The current transit service is
 anticipated to reasonably accommodate future ridership.
 Frontage improvements will improve the sidewalks along 161st Ave NE and NE 80th Street and provide
 new sidewalks along NE 81st Street.

 Mitigation
 The study intersections and site access satisfy the City of Redmond’s LOS standards and vehicle queues
 are not projected to adversely affect Project trip circulation. No offsite mitigation is required.
 As indicated above, the applicant will complete the road extension of NE 81st Street and will provide
 their frontage improvements as required by the City of Redmond.
 Traffic impact fees will be computed by the city and are due at the time of building permit issuance.
