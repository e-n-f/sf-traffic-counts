Executive Summary

This report documents the analysis performed at five signalized intersections in Morgan Hill,
California. The performed analysis evaluated operational and functional issues at these
intersections under existing conditions. Recommendations for intersection-level improvements
are identified at each intersection, including conceptual designs of geometric improvements.
The following five intersections were analyzed in this report:

1. Condit Road / E Dunne Avenue
2. Butterfield Boulevard / Tennant Avenue
3. Monterey Road / Main Avenue
4. Butterfield Boulevard / E Dunne Avenue
5. Monterey Road / W Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue

Recommended Improvements:
The following improvements are recommended for implementation at the study intersections.
See Appendix E for conceptual designs of these improvements. All of the study intersections
would operate at or better than their respective levels of service after implementation of these
improvements.

Intersection 1 – Condit Road / E Dunne Avenue:

1. Widen and restripe northbound Condit Road approach as one left turn lane, one through
   lane and one right turn lane. This improvement requires roadway widening of approximately
   12 feet.
2. Restripe southbound Condit Road approach as one left turn lane and one shared through-
   right turn lane. This improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement width.
3. Convert northbound and southbound Condit Road signal phasing from “Split” to “Protected”
   simultaneous left turn phasing.
4. Lengthen the eastbound E Dunne Avenue left turn lane at the intersection by 75 feet.
5. Restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue approach at the intersection to extend existing bicycle
   lane to the intersection. This improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement
   width.
6. Restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue between Condit Road and US 101 northbound
   onramp to provide a bike lane between the through and right turn lanes. This improvement
   can be implemented within the existing pavement width.
7. Restripe eastbound E Dunne Avenue in advance of Condit Road to add standard bicycle
   lane pavement striping and markings near the intersection. This improvement can be
   implemented within the existing pavement width.
8. Add shared lane markings (or “sharrows”) on the northbound Condit Road and southbound
   Condit Road approaches.

Intersection 2 – Butterfield Boulevard / Tennant Avenue:

1. Lengthen the westbound Tennant Avenue left turn lane by 75 feet and reduce the eastbound
   Tennant Avenue left turn lane at Juan Hernandez Drive by a corresponding 75 feet.
2. Widen and restripe westbound Tennant Avenue to provide a bike lane between the through
   and right turn lanes. This improvement requires roadway widening of approximately 4 feet.
3. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Intersection 3 – Monterey Road / Main Avenue:

1. Restripe eastbound and westbound Main Avenue approaches as one left turn lane and one
   shared through-right turn lane. This improvement can be implemented within the existing
   pavement width.
2. Convert eastbound and westbound Main Avenue signal phasing to from “Split” to “Protected”
   simultaneous left turn phasing.
3. Lengthen the northbound Monterey Road left turn lane by 125 feet.
4. Extend the eastbound Main Avenue left turn lane by 25 feet. Add centerline striping on Main
   Avenue west of Monterey Road to direct approaching eastbound through traffic to proceed
   into the through lane at the intersection.
5. Add shared lane markings (or “sharrows”) on the northbound and southbound Monterey
   Road approaches of the intersection.
6. Remove existing pedestrian push button located on south median of Monterey Road.
7. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Intersection 4 – Butterfield Boulevard / E Dunne Avenue:

1. Widen and restripe southbound Butterfield Boulevard to add a second southbound left turn
   lane. Restripe and adjust median as necessary on southbound Butterfield Boulevard leaving
   the intersection to better line up with restriping on opposite approach of intersection. The
   improvement north of E Dunne Avenue requires roadway widening of approximately 10 feet,
   while the improvement south of E Dunne Avenue can be implemented within the existing
   pavement width.
2. Consider extending the existing bicycle lane on southbound Butterfield Boulevard to the
   intersection. This improvement will require approximately 4 feet of roadway widening. If
   combined with the widening and restriping improvement discussed previously, a total of
   14 feet of roadway widening would be necessary.
3. Widen and restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue to add a westbound right turn. This
   improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement width at the intersection, but
   will require approximately 1 foot of widening immediately east of the drainage canal.
4. Replace pedestrian push buttons at the northwest, northeast and southeast corners of the
   intersection with large button, ADA-compliant hardware.
5. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.

Intersection #5 – Monterey Road / W Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue:

1. Restripe northbound and southbound Monterey Road to extend existing bicycle lane to
   intersection. This improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement width.
2. Add tracking striping for southbound, eastbound and westbound dual left turn movements
   across intersection.
3. Relocate pedestrian push buttons at northwest corner to be more accessible from the
   crosswalks.
4. Replace pedestrian push buttons at the northeast and southeast corners of the intersection
   with large button, ADA-compliant hardware.
5. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.

2 Study Area Description

This chapter summarizes the study area, the data collected and obtained, and the methods and
methodologies used in this analysis.

2.1       Study Area
All of the study intersections are under the jurisdiction of the City of Morgan Hill. These study
intersections are some of the major citywide intersections that have historically have had the
greatest level of congestion and vehicle delays.

2.2       Area Transportation Network
The study intersections involve the following city roadways, listed in alphabetical order:

Butterfield Boulevard is a north-south, four-lane arterial roadway east of Downtown Morgan
Hill. In combination with Cochrane Road, Butterfield Boulevard serves as a bypass of the

Tennant Avenue is an east-west, four-lane major arterial in southern Morgan Hill. It provides
access to various residential neighborhoods and commercial centers in central and eastern
Morgan Hill. The speed limit on Tennant Avenue is 40 mph east of Vineyard Boulevard and
35 mph west of Vineyard Boulevard.

2.3       Area Transit
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) provides public transit service
throughout Santa Clara County, including in Morgan Hill. There are multiple bus stops in the
vicinity of the study intersections, serviced by various transit routes traversing the city each day.
More specifics regarding the location of the bus stops and the routes serviced are summarizes
for each intersection in the following chapters.

2.4       Field Visit
A field visit was conducted with city staff on Friday, June 2, 2017 to each of the five study
intersections. Operational issues at each intersection were discussed with city staff, traffic
operations were observed, and existing intersection geometrics were documented. A
supplementary field visit was conducted on Monday, June 26, 2017 for additional intersection
geometrical data collection.

2.5       Data Collection
New intersection traffic volume counts were conducted at the five study intersections on
Wednesday, May 31, 2017. These counts were conducted during the AM (7:00 – 9:00 AM) and
PM (4:00 – 6:00 PM) peak periods, and included cars, trucks, buses, pedestrians and bicycles.
From these counts, the peak one-hour traffic volumes during each peak period were identified
for each intersection. Figure 2 depicts the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at the
study intersections. The traffic counts can also be found in Appendix A.

Figure 3 depicts the existing traffic control and lane configuration at each study intersection.

Existing signal timing information was obtained from the City of Morgan Hill for use in this
analysis.

Table 1 depicts the collision rate at each study intersection. These rates were quantified using
collision data over the past three years (July 1, 2014 through July 3, 2017) that was provided by
the City of Morgan Hill. The collision data can also be found in Appendix B.

2.6       Initial Findings
A technical memorandum – Morgan Hill Intersection Capacity Analysis – Initial Findings, Mott
MacDonald, June 27, 2017 – was prepared and submitted to the City of Morgan Hill. This
memo summarizes the findings from our field visit with city staff and our additional investigations
and research. The findings described in this memorandum are summarized for each
intersection in the following chapters.

2.7       Operational Analysis
An operational analysis was performed during the AM and PM peak hours at each study
intersection, using the traffic volumes and signal timing information discussed previously in
Section 2.5. This analysis utilizes the Synchro 9 software and the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual methodologies.

The intersection traffic operations were evaluated based upon the level of service (LOS)
concept. LOS is a qualitative description of an intersection’s operations, ranging from LOS A to
LOS F. Level of Service “A” represents free flow uncongested traffic conditions. Level of
Service “F” represents highly congested traffic conditions with unacceptable delay to vehicles at
intersections. The intermediate levels of service represent incremental levels of congestion and
delay between these two extremes. A LOS description is included as Appendix C.

Table 2 summarizes the operational analysis at the study intersections; this analysis is further
discussed in the following chapters.

2.8       Improvement Implementation
The improvements recommended in this report will be incorporated into the City of Morgan Hill
Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for implementation by the city as funding allows.

3 Intersection 1 – Condit Road / E Dunne
Avenue

This chapter describes the operations and recommendations for Intersection 1 – Condit Road /
E Dunne Avenue.

3.1       Intersection Description
This intersection is located on the eastern side of Morgan Hill, one block east of the US 101 /
E Dunne Avenue interchange.

3.1.1          Vehicle Facilities
The Condit / E Dunne intersection is signal controlled. See Figure 3 for the lane configuration
at this intersection. E Dunne Avenue has a raised center median on both its approaches to this
intersection, while Condit Road only has a double-yellow stripe separating each direction of
travel.

3.1.2          Pedestrian Facilities
Crosswalks are located across all four approaches of this intersection. Sidewalks are located
alongside most approaches, but are not present on along the south side of E Dunne Avenue
(both east and west of Condit Road) and along the east side of Condit Road south of E Dunne
Avenue.

3.1.3          Bicycle Facilities
Although bicycle lanes are present along both directions of E Dunne Avenue near the study
intersection, they are discontinuous at Condit Road in both directions. The shoulder of
eastbound E Dunne Avenue east of US 101 is signed as a bike lane but lacks the correct
pavement markings.

3.1.4          Transit Facilities
There are no bus routes near this intersection.

3.2       Collision History
As shown in Table 1, the collision rate over the past three years at the Condit / E Dunne
intersection is 1.63 collisions per million vehicle miles, which is nearly three times higher than
the statewide average for similar intersections.

3.3       Existing Operations

3.3.1          Field Visit and Additional Investigations
The following list summarizes our findings from the field visit and additional investigations and
research at Intersection 1 – Condit Road / E Dunne Avenue:

1. The eastbound E Dunne left turn lane is too short for the vehicular demand. Extension of
   this lane is complicated by the proximity of the US 101 northbound ramp intersection to the
   west. Current signal operations allow this movement to be served twice in a single signal
   cycle.
2. Through bicyclists on westbound E Dunne west of Condit must weave across traffic that is
   turning right onto the US 101 northbound onramp. The heaviest traffic is during the AM peak
   hour.
3. Lack of sidewalks along the south side of E Dunne (east and west of Condit) and along the
   east side of Condit (south of E Dunne). The proposed apartment complex at the southeast
   corner of Condit and E Dunne will add a sidewalk along its frontage.
4. Split phasing on northbound and southbound Condit (where the northbound left, through and
   right turn movements proceed separately from the southbound left, through and right turn
   movements) causes inefficient vehicle throughput at intersection. The aforementioned
   apartment complex will provide road widening to accommodate separate northbound left,
   through and right turn lanes. This could also allow for the conversion of north/south signal
   phasing to a more efficient eight-phase protected phasing, which would require the restriping
   of the southbound approach.
5. Pedestrian clearance times for all crosswalks are not long enough to meet current California
   Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD) requirements.
6. Bicycle lanes on the following intersection approaches do not continue through the
   intersection:
    a. Eastbound E Dunne Avenue (bike lane signs are present, but no bike lane pavement
       legend or dashed bike lane striping at intersection)
    b. Westbound E Dunne Avenue

3.3.2          Operational Analysis
According to the City of Morgan Hill General Plan, the Condit / E Dunne intersection has a level
of service standard of LOS E. Existing AM and PM operations are summarized in Table 2. The
level of service calculations for this intersection can be found in Appendix D.

The Condit / E Dunne intersection currently operates at LOS D during both the AM and PM
peak hours, which is better than its level of service standard.

3.4       Recommended Improvements
The following improvements are recommended at Intersection 1 – Condit Road / E Dunne
Avenue. These improvements are based upon the findings summarizes in Section 3.3.1 and
additional findings discovered during the conceptual design process.

1. Widen and restripe northbound Condit Road approach as one left turn lane, one through
   lane and one right turn lane. This improvement requires roadway widening of approximately
   12 feet.
2. Restripe southbound Condit Road approach as one left turn lane and one shared through-
   right turn lane. This improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement width.

3. Convert northbound and southbound Condit Road signal phasing from “Split” to “Protected”
   simultaneous left turn phasing.
4. Lengthen the eastbound E Dunne Avenue left turn lane at the intersection by 75 feet.
5. Restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue approach at the intersection to extend existing bicycle
   lane to the intersection. This improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement
   width.
6. Restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue between Condit Road and US 101 northbound
   onramp to provide a bike lane between the through and right turn lanes. This improvement
   can be implemented within the existing pavement width.
7. Restripe eastbound E Dunne Avenue in advance of Condit Road to add standard bicycle
   lane pavement striping and markings near the intersection. This improvement can be
   implemented within the existing pavement width.
8. Add shared lane markings (or “sharrows”) on the northbound Condit Road and southbound
   Condit Road approaches.
9. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Appendix E contains a conceptual design of these improvements, and Table 2 summarizes the
levels of service with implementation of these improvements. After implementation of these
improvements, the Condit / E Dunne intersection would operate at or better than its level of
service standard. Note, however, that the reduction in delay associated with the recommended
improvements is partially offset by the increased signal pedestrian crossing times.

Notes:

1. Vehicle Turning Templates – Vehicle turning templates, which show the travel path of
   vehicles passing through the intersection, were applied at this intersection to verify that
   opposing left turning vehicles on Condit Road can proceed simultaneously through the
   intersection without encroaching on each other. These templates can be found in
   Appendix E. Our application of the templates found that opposing left turning vehicles on
   Condit Road can proceed simultaneously through the intersection. This conclusion is
   incorporated into the improvement recommendations for this intersection.
2. Landscaping Removal – The lengthening of the eastbound E Dunne Avenue left turn lane
   would require removal of various existing landscaping in the median, potentially including
   existing trees.
3. Caltrans Design Exemption – The improvement to restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue to
   add a bicycle lane between the through and right turn lanes would require the narrowing of
   the existing lanes below 12 feet. If a portion of these improvements would extend onto the
   Caltrans right-of-way, the proposed non-standard lane width design would require a Caltrans
   Design Exception (i.e., prior Caltrans approval for deviations from state roadway standards).
   The City of Morgan Hill would be responsible for the filing of the request for a design
   exception. Alternatively, the roadway could be widened a few feet to maintain the standard
   12-foot wide lanes.

4 Intersection 2 – Butterfield Boulevard /
Tennant Avenue

This chapter describes the operations and recommendations for Intersection 2 – Butterfield
Boulevard / Tennant Avenue.

4.1       Intersection Description
This intersection is located in the southern portion of Morgan Hill, two blocks west of the
US 101 / Tennant Avenue interchange. The traffic signal on Juan Hernandez Drive at Tennant
Avenue is located approximately halfway between Butterfield and the US 101 southbound
ramps, or approximately 650 feet east of Butterfield Boulevard. A drainage canal is also located
approximately 10 feet east of Butterfield Boulevard.

4.1.1          Vehicle Facilities
The Butterfield / Tennant intersection is signal controlled. See Figure 3 for the lane
configuration at this intersection. Both Butterfield Boulevard and Tennant Avenue have raised
center medians on both of their approaches to this intersection.

4.1.2          Pedestrian Facilities
Crosswalks are located across all four approaches of this intersection. Sidewalks are sporadic
at this intersection, located only at the intersection corners and continuing down each approach
primarily alongside developed parcels near this intersection. There are no sidewalks on
northbound Butterfield Boulevard, nor along either side of Tennant Avenue east of Butterfield
Boulevard. However, in its Bikeways, Trails, Parks and Recreation Master Plan, adopted by the
City of Morgan Hill on July 20, 2017, the City of Morgan Hill proposes to add a paved multi-use
trail between Butterfield Boulevard and the aforementioned drainage canal (Improvement T-
A12).

4.1.3          Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle lanes are present along all approaches to the intersection, although the bike lane along
westbound Tennant Avenue is the only one that is discontinuous at the intersection.

4.1.4          Transit Facilities
There are no bus stops near this intersection.

4.2       Collision History
As shown in Table 1, the collision rate over the past three years at the Butterfield / Tennant
intersection is 1.19 collisions per million vehicle miles, which is more than two times higher than
the statewide average for similar intersections.

4.3       Existing Operations

4.3.1          Field Visit and Additional Investigations
The following list summarizes our findings from the field visit and additional investigations and
research at Intersection 2 – Butterfield Boulevard / Tennant Avenue:

1. The westbound Tennant left turn lane is too short for the vehicle demand. Extension of this
   lane is complicated by the proximity of the Juan Hernandez intersection to the east. City
   staff expressed concern that even if the westbound left turn lane is extended, access to the
   westbound left turn lane may still be blocked by vehicle queues in the adjacent through lane.
   Current signal operations allow this movement to be served twice in a single signal cycle.
2. Pedestrian clearance times for all crosswalks are not long enough to meet current CA
   MUTCD requirements.
3. Bicycle lanes on the following intersection approaches do not continue through the
   intersection:
    a. Westbound Tennant Avenue

4.3.2          Operational Analysis
According to the City of Morgan Hill General Plan, the Butterfield / Tennant intersection has a
level of service standard of LOS E. Existing AM and PM operations are summarized in Table 2.
The level of service calculations for this intersection can be found in Appendix D.

The Butterfield / Tennant intersection currently operates at LOS D during the AM peak hour and
LOS E during the PM peak hour, which is at or better than its level of service standard.

4.4       Recommended Improvements
The following improvements are recommended at Intersection 2 – Butterfield Boulevard /
Tennant Avenue. These improvements are based upon the findings summarizes in Section
4.3.1 and additional findings discovered during the conceptual design process.

1. Lengthen the westbound Tennant Avenue left turn lane by 75 feet and reduce the eastbound
   Tennant Avenue left turn lane at Juan Hernandez Drive by a corresponding 75 feet.
2. Widen and restripe westbound Tennant Avenue to provide a bike lane between the through
   and right turn lanes. This improvement requires roadway widening of approximately 4 feet.
3. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Appendix E contains a conceptual design of these improvements, and Table 2 summarizes the
levels of service with implementation of these improvements. After implementation of these
improvements, the Butterfield / Tennant intersection would operate at or better than its level of
service standard. Note, however, that the reduction in delay associated with the recommended
improvements is partially offset by the increased signal pedestrian crossing times.

Notes: None.

4.5       Not Recommended Improvements
There are two potential improvements that could improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation at
this intersection. However, their implementation is not recommended at this intersection for
various reasons. Each is discussed below. A conceptual design of each of these improvement
options is in Appendix E.

4.5.1          Right Turn Channelization Islands
The implementation of right turn channelization islands would improve pedestrian circulation by
reducing the pedestrian crossing length across any one approach of the intersection. This
would reduce the amount of pedestrian/vehicle conflict area at the intersection and reduce the
necessary pedestrian crossing time. However, these islands would need to be designed to
accommodate all types of vehicles, including buses and trucks, and could not block the bicycle
lanes on any of the intersection approaches. These restrictions would make the size of the
islands so small that they could not provide adequate refuge for crossing pedestrians. In
addition, pedestrians would need to cross an uncontrolled right turn movement to go between
the island and intersection corner. For these reasons, right turn channelization islands are not
recommended.

4.5.2          Two-Stage Turn Queue Boxes
Two-stage turn queue boxes are areas near the intersection corners that allow bicyclists to
queue up while waiting to cross an additional approach to the intersection. Two-stage turn
queue boxes allow bicyclists to turn left by crossing two conflicting intersection approaches in
series, rather than weaving through vehicle traffic to reach the left turn lane. This improvement
would thus be an easier option for turning left at traffic signals. However, due to the location of
this box at the intersection, it would block right turns on red for most vehicles when a bicycle
occupies the box, reducing the overall capacity of the intersection. Smaller vehicles would also
likely attempt to turn right on red while a bicyclist is in the queue box, potentially encroaching
into the bicyclist in the queue box. This improvement is also a relatively new concept, which
has very limited implementation, so the understanding and response from the bicycle and
driving community in Morgan Hill is uncertain. For those reasons, two-stage turn queue boxes
are not recommended.

5 Intersection 3 – Monterey Road / Main
Avenue

This chapter describes the operations and recommendations for Intersection 3 – Monterey
Road / Main Avenue.

5.1       Intersection Description
This intersection is located in the central portion of the City of Morgan Hill on the northern side
of the city’s central business district. It is also three blocks northwest of the Morgan Hill Caltrain
station.

5.1.1          Vehicle Facilities
The Monterey / Main intersection is signal controlled. See Figure 3 for the lane configuration at
this intersection. Monterey Road has a raised center median on both its approaches to this
intersection, while Main Avenue only has a double-yellow stripe separating each direction of
travel.

5.1.2          Pedestrian Facilities
Crosswalks are located across all four approaches of this intersection. Sidewalks are also
located alongside all approaches.

5.1.3          Bicycle Facilities
Although bicycle lanes are present along all approaches of the Monterey / Main intersection,
they are also discontinuous on all approaches at the intersection.

5.1.4          Transit Facilities
There are bus stops in each direction of Main Avenue west of Monterey Road. They are served
by Route 68 (eastbound only) and Routes 16 and 68 (westbound only). There is also a bus
stop along the south side of Main Avenue east of Monterey, serviced by Route 16. There are
no bus stops on Monterey Road near the intersection.

5.2       Collision History
As shown in Table 1, the collision rate over the past three years at the Monterey / Main
intersection is 1.20 collisions per million vehicle miles, which is nearly four times higher than the
statewide average for similar intersections.

5.3       Existing Operations

5.3.1          Field Visit and Additional Investigations
The following list summarizes our findings from the field visit and additional investigations and
research at Intersection 3 – Monterey Road / Main Avenue:

1. Split phasing (where the eastbound northbound left, through and right turn movements
   proceed separately from the westbound left, through and right turn movements) was
   instituted a number of years ago on eastbound and westbound Main Avenue to address high
   collision rates at the intersection. Although collision rates have reduced substantially, split
   phasing causes inefficient vehicle throughput at intersection. This is most evident in long
   vehicle queues in both directions of Main Avenue.
2. The northbound Monterey Road left turn lane is too short for the vehicle demand.
3. Pedestrian clearance times for all crosswalks are not long enough to meet current CA
   MUTCD requirements.
4. Pedestrian push button located on south median of Monterey Road is not reachable from a
   wheelchair.
5. Bicycle lanes on the following intersection approaches do not continue through the
   intersection:
    a. Eastbound W Main Avenue
    b. Westbound E Main Avenue
    c. Northbound Monterey Road
    d. Southbound Monterey Road

5.3.2          Operational Analysis
According to the City of Morgan Hill General Plan, the Monterey / Main intersection has a level
of service standard of LOS F. Existing AM and PM operations are summarized in Table 2. The
level of service calculations for this intersection can be found in Appendix D.

The Monterey / Main intersection currently operates at LOS E during the AM peak hour and
LOS D during the PM peak hour, which is better than its level of service standard.

5.4       Recommended Improvements
The following improvements are recommended at Intersection 3 – Monterey Road / Main
Avenue. These improvements are based upon the findings summarizes in Section 5.3.1 and
additional findings discovered during the conceptual design process.

1. Restripe eastbound and westbound Main Avenue approaches as one left turn lane and one
   shared through-right turn lane. This improvement can be implemented within the existing
   pavement width.
2. Convert eastbound and westbound Main Avenue signal phasing to from “Split” to “Protected”
   simultaneous left turn phasing.
3. Lengthen the northbound Monterey Road left turn lane by 125 feet.
4. Extend the eastbound Main Avenue left turn lane by 25 feet. Add centerline striping on Main
   Avenue west of Monterey Road to direct approaching eastbound through traffic to proceed
   into the through lane at the intersection.
5. Add shared lane markings (or “sharrows”) on the northbound and southbound Monterey
   Road approaches of the intersection.

6. Remove existing pedestrian push button located on south median of Monterey Road.
7. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Appendix E contains a conceptual design of these improvements, and Table 2 summarizes the
levels of service with implementation of these improvements. After implementation of these
improvements, the Monterey / Main intersection would operate better than its level of service
standard. Note, however, that the reduction in delay associated with the recommended
improvements is partially offset by the increased signal pedestrian crossing times.

Notes:

1. Centerline Striping – To allow traffic into the driveway for the business at the northwest
   corner of the Monterey / Main intersection, it is recommended that the existing double-yellow
   striping on Main Avenue west of Monterey Road be removed directly in front of the driveway.
   This improvement would continue to allow left turns into the driveway from eastbound Main
   Avenue.
2. Tree Removal – The lengthening of the northbound Monterey Road left turn lane would
   require removal of the existing trees in the median of Monterey Road, as these trees are
   centered in the middle of the median.
3. Bus Stop Relocations – The recommended restriping improvements on Main Avenue west of
   Monterey Road may affect the bus stops on at least one side the roadway near the
   improvement location. Further detailed designs of this improvement should further
   investigate this effect.

6 Intersection 4 – Butterfield Boulevard / E
Dunne Avenue

This chapter describes the operations and recommendations for Intersection 4 – Butterfield
Boulevard / E Dunne Avenue.

6.1       Intersection Description
This intersection is located in the central portion of Morgan Hill, southwest of the city’s central
business district. It is also two blocks east of the Morgan Hill Community and Cultural Center,
one block south of the Santa Clara County Superior Courthouse (South County facility and two
blocks south of the Morgan Hill Caltrain station. A drainage canal is also located approximately
20 feet east of Butterfield Boulevard.

6.1.1          Vehicle Facilities
The Butterfield / E Dunne intersection is signal controlled. See Figure 3 for the lane
configuration at this intersection. Both Butterfield Boulevard and E Dunne Avenue have raised
center medians on both of their approaches to this intersection.

6.1.2          Pedestrian Facilities
Crosswalks are located across all four approaches of this intersection. Sidewalks are also
located alongside all approaches. The sidewalks along the east side of Butterfield Boulevard
continue as a paved multi-use trail that extends both north and south of the intersection.

6.1.3          Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle lanes are present along all approaches of the Butterfield / E Dunne intersection.
However, they are discontinuous on both of the Butterfield Boulevard approaches at the
intersection.

6.1.4          Transit Facilities
There are no bus stops near this intersection.

6.2       Collision History
As shown in Table 1, the collision rate over the past three years at the Condit / E Dunne
intersection is 1.00 collisions per million vehicle miles, which is nearly two times higher than the
statewide average for similar intersections.

6.3       Existing Operations

6.3.1          Field Visit and Additional Investigations
The following list summarizes our findings from the field visit and additional investigations and
research at Intersection 4 – Butterfield Boulevard / E Dunne Avenue:

1. The southbound Butterfield left turn lane is too short for the vehicle demand. A second
   southbound left turn lane may be possible with roadway widening to the west.

2. High pedestrian activity during large special events in the downtown, such as the Mushroom
   Mardi Gras.
3. Due to high vehicular demand for this movement, westbound E Dunne right turns frequently
   use bicycle lane and adjacent parking aisle as a de-facto right turn lane.
4. Presence of drainage canal along eastern frontage of Butterfield limits the ability to make
   improvements on eastern side of intersection.
5. Pedestrian clearance times for all crosswalks are not long enough to meet current CA
   MUTCD requirements.
6. Pedestrian push buttons at the following corners of the intersection should be replaced with
   large button, ADA compliant hardware:
    a. Northwest corner of intersection, controlling crosswalk crossing E Dunne
    b. Northeast corner of intersection, controlling crosswalk crossing Butterfield
    c. Northeast corner of intersection, controlling crosswalk crossing E Dunne
    d. Southeast corner of intersection, controlling crosswalk crossing E Dunne
7. Bicycle lanes on the following intersection approaches do not continue through the
   intersection:
    a. Northbound Butterfield Boulevard
    b. Southbound Butterfield Boulevard

6.3.2          Operational Analysis
According to the City of Morgan Hill General Plan, the Butterfield / E Dunne intersection has a
level of service standard of LOS E. Existing AM and PM operations are summarized in Table 2.
The level of service calculations for this intersection can be found in Appendix D.

The Butterfield / E Dunne intersection currently operates at LOS D during both the AM and PM
peak hours, which is better than its level of service standard.

6.4       Recommended Improvements
The following improvements are recommended at Intersection 4 – Butterfield Boulevard / E
Dunne Avenue. These improvements are based upon the findings summarizes in Section 6.3.1
and additional findings discovered during the conceptual design process.

1. Widen and restripe southbound Butterfield Boulevard to add a second southbound left turn
   lane. Restripe and adjust median as necessary on southbound Butterfield Boulevard leaving
   the intersection to better line up with restriping on opposite approach of intersection. The
   improvement north of E Dunne Avenue requires roadway widening of approximately 10 feet,
   while the improvement south of E Dunne Avenue can be implemented within the existing
   pavement width.
2. Consider extending the existing bicycle lane on southbound Butterfield Boulevard to the
   intersection. This improvement will require approximately 4 feet of roadway widening. If
   combined with the widening and restriping improvement discussed previously, a total of
   14 feet of roadway widening would be necessary.
3. Widen and restripe westbound E Dunne Avenue to add a westbound right turn. This
   improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement width at the intersection, but
   will require approximately 1 foot of widening immediately east of the drainage canal.
4. Replace pedestrian push buttons at the northwest, northeast and southeast corners of the
   intersection with large button, ADA-compliant hardware.

5. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Appendix E contains a conceptual design of these improvements, and Table 2 summarizes the
levels of service with implementation of these improvements. After implementation of these
improvements, the Butterfield / Tennant intersection would operate at or better than its level of

improvements is partially offset by the increased signal pedestrian crossing times.

Notes: None.

6.5       Not Recommended Improvements
Similar to Intersection 2 – Butterfield Boulevard / Tennant Avenue – both right turn
channelization islands and two-stage turn queue boxes are also not recommended at
Intersection 4 – Butterfield Boulevard / E Dunne Avenue. See Section 4.5 for more information

7 Intersection 5 – Monterey Road / W
Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue

This chapter describes the operations and recommendations for Intersection 5 – Monterey
Road / West Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue.

7.1       Intersection Description
This intersection is located in the southwestern portion of Morgan Hill, and is surrounded by
multiple commercial shopping centers.

7.1.1          Vehicle Facilities
The Monterey / W Edmundson – Tennant intersection is signal controlled. See Figure 3 for the
lane configuration at this intersection. All four approaches to this intersection have raised center
medians.

7.1.2          Pedestrian Facilities
Crosswalks are located across all four approaches of this intersection. Sidewalks are also
located alongside all approaches.

7.1.3          Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle lanes are present along all approaches of the Monterey / W Edmundson – Tennant
intersection. However, they are discontinuous on both of the Monterey Road approaches at the
intersection. The City of Morgan Hill proposed to extend the northbound Monterey Road bike
lane through the intersection after repaving Monterey Road in August or September 2017.

7.1.4          Transit Facilities
A bus stop is located on northbound Monterey Road north of Tennant Avenue. Routes 68, 121
and 168 all stop at this location.

7.2       Collision History
As shown in Table 1, the collision rate over the past three years at the Condit / E Dunne
intersection is 0.21 collisions per million vehicle miles, which is less than the statewide average
for similar intersections.

7.3       Existing Operations

7.3.1          Field Visit and Additional Investigations
The following list summarizes our findings from the field visit and additional investigations and
research at Intersection 5 – Monterey Road / West Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue:

1. The southbound Monterey dual left turn lanes are too short for the vehicle demand, but
   cannot be extended due to proximity to commercial driveways. Current signal operations
   allow this movement to be served twice in a single cycle.
2. Lack of tracking striping for southbound, eastbound and westbound dual left turn movements
   across intersection.

3. Lack of northbound Monterey bicycle lane approaching intersection. Bicycle lane striping will
   be added after roadway repaving in August/September 2017.
4. Pedestrian clearance times for all crosswalks are not long enough to meet current CA
   MUTCD requirements.
5. Pedestrian push buttons located at northwest corner of intersection (controlling crosswalks
   crossing both Monterey and W Edmundson) are not reachable from a wheelchair.
6. Pedestrian push buttons at the following corners of the intersection should be replaced with
   large button, ADA compliant hardware:
    a. Northeast corner of intersection, controlling crosswalk crossing Tennant
    b. Southwest corner of intersection, controlling crosswalk across Monterey
7. Bicycle lanes on the following intersection approaches do not continue through the
   intersection:
    a. Northbound Monterey Road
    b. Southbound Monterey Road

7.3.2          Operational Analysis
According to the City of Morgan Hill General Plan, the Monterey / W Edmundson – Tennant
intersection has a level of service standard of LOS E. Existing AM and PM operations are
summarized in Table 2. The level of service calculations for this intersection can be found in
Appendix D.

The Monterey / W Edmundson – Tennant intersection currently operates at LOS C during the
AM and PM peak hours, which is better than its level of service standard.

7.4       Recommended Improvements
The following improvements are recommended at Intersection 5 – Monterey Road / W
Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue. These improvements are based upon the findings
summarizes in Section 7.3.1 and additional findings discovered during the conceptual design
process.

1. Restripe northbound and southbound Monterey Road to extend existing bicycle lane to
   intersection. This improvement can be implemented within the existing pavement width.
2. Add tracking striping for southbound, eastbound and westbound dual left turn movements
   across intersection.
3. Relocate pedestrian push buttons at northwest corner to be more accessible from the
   crosswalks.
4. Replace pedestrian push buttons at the northeast and southeast corners of the intersection
   with large button, ADA-compliant hardware.
5. Increase signal pedestrian crossing times at all intersection crosswalks to meet CA MUTCD
   requirements.
Appendix E contains a conceptual design of these improvements, and Table 2 summarizes the
levels of service with implementation of these improvements. After implementation of these
improvements, the Butterfield / Tennant intersection would operate at or better than its level of
service standard. Note, however, that the reduction in delay associated with the recommended
improvements is partially offset by the increased signal pedestrian crossing times.

Note:
1. Southbound Monterey Road Left Turn Lane – Although the southbound Monterey dual left
   turn lanes are too short for their vehicle demand, geometric constrains at the intersection do
   not allow for the lengthening of either lane. These constrains include an existing driveway
   opening at the end of the outermost southbound Monterey left turn lane and an existing
   northbound Monterey left turn lane providing access to said driveway. The existing signal
   operations that allow this movement to be served twice in a single cycle is the only method
   to accommodate the demand for this movement.

7.5       Not Recommended Improvements
Similar to Intersection 2 – Butterfield Boulevard / Tennant Avenue – both right turn
channelization islands and two-stage turn queue boxes are also not recommended at
Intersection 5 – Monterey Road / W Edmundson Avenue – Tennant Avenue. See Section 4.5
for more information about why these improvements are not recommended.
