                                 Executive Summary
This section provides an executive summary of the Transportation Impact Analysis through a
set of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

Where is the project located and what would be developed?
The project is located along the west side of the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street
intersection in Issaquah. The development would include the construction of 81 apartment
units and 12 townhome units through two buildings, Building B in Parcel B, and Building C in
Parcel C.

What existing public streets will serve the project and where is access proposed?
Newport Way NW, Maple Street NW, NW Juniper Street, and NW Gilman Boulevard are
primary roadways within the surrounding area and all would serve project traffic. Site access
is proposed via driveways on Newport Way NW.

Is the site currently served by public transit?
King County Metro currently operates 5 routes in the area, and Sound Transit currently
operates 3 routes in the area. The closest transit stops are east of the site at the NW Gilman
Blvd/NW Juniper Street intersection, approximately 0.5 miles (or an 8- to 10-minute walk)
from the site.

How many new parking spaces are proposed?
The proposed project would provide two parking garages, with 113 stalls in Building B and 8
stalls in Building C, totaling 121 parking stalls.

How many daily vehicular trips would the project generate and when would peak traffic
volumes occur?
It is anticipated that the project will generate approximately 674 weekday daily trips with 47
occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 67 during the PM peak hour.

What Transportation impacts are anticipated, if any?
No impacts are anticipated.

What measures are proposed to reduce or control traffic impacts?
In addition to the construction of frontage improvements, the project is planning to include
construction of the City planned roundabout at the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street
intersection in lieu of paying traffic impact fees.

Inneswood Apartments                                                                 December 2015



                                     Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of two apartment buildings located west of Newport Way
NW, north and south of NW Juniper Street in Issaquah. As necessary, mitigation measures
are identified that would offset or reduce significant transportation related impacts that the
proposed project may have on the surrounding transportation system.


Project Description
As shown on Figure 1, the proposed project is located west of Newport Way NW, north and
south of NW Juniper Street. The development would construct 81 apartment units and 12
townhome units through two buildings. Building C is located south of NW Juniper Street and
would contain 7 apartments units. Building B is located north of NW Juniper Street and would
contain 74 apartment units and 12 townhome units. There is an existing single family home
on the property that would be demolished as part of the project. Figure 2 illustrates the
preliminary site plan.

One garage is proposed as part of each building. Building C is anticipated to have 8 stalls,
and Building B is anticipated to have 113 stalls, totaling 121 parking stalls. Access to both
parking locations is proposed via Newport Way NW. It is anticipated that the development
would be constructed and occupied by 2018.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with the City of Issaquah staff and follows the
City’s Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines, April 2015. Based on the anticipated trip
generation and distribution of the proposed project, the largest impacts would occur
immediately adjacent to the project site. The following intersections are proposed for
analysis:

        NW Maple Street (Newport Way NW)/Maple Street NW
        Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street
        NW Gilman Boulevard/NW Juniper Street
        Newport Way NW/Library Access

In addition, the access points along Newport Way NW were evaluated under future (2018)
with-project conditions. The study focuses on the weekday PM peak hours when
transportation impacts are anticipated to be highest. The report first describes existing and
future (2018) without-project conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the
street system, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2018)
with-project conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding
transportation system were identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the
future without-project conditions.

   Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing (2015) and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system, planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service.


Street System
The following describes the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed project
and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.
Existing
The project site is located in Issaquah, WA, and is bounded by Newport Way NW to the west.
The major roadways within the study area include:

NW Maple Street is an east-west roadway, continuing into Newport Way NW south of Maple
Street NW. Classified as a minor arterial, NW Maple Street includes five lanes with a center
two-way left-turn lane. On the east end of NW Maple Street, the roadway curves to the
southeast and becomes Newport Way NW. Shortly after, the roadway narrows to two lanes.
Both the north and south sides of NW Maple Street have landscaped sidewalks. The posted
speed along NW Maple Street is 30 miles per hour (mph).

NW Gilman Boulevard is a five-lane roadway classified as a minor arterial with sidewalks
and a two-way left turn lane. The two-way left-turn lane allows access to the adjacent Gilman
Village and Issaquah Commons retail areas and includes a landscaped center median. The
roadway has bike lanes in each direction from its intersection with Maple Street NW heading
southeast. The posted speed along NW Gilman Boulevard is 35 mph.

NW Juniper Street is an east-west collector arterial connecting Newport Way NW and NW
Gilman Boulevard. The two-lane two-way roadway includes sidewalks on both north and
south sides, as well as parallel parking along the south side. The posted speed limit along
NW Juniper Street is 25 mph.

Newport Way NW is a two-lane two-way principal arterial with a sidewalk on the east side of
the roadway. The roadway connects Maple Street NW and NW Juniper Street and provides
direct access to the proposed project site near the NW Juniper Street intersection. The
posted speed limit along Newport Way NW is 30 mph. Newport Way NW is also designated
as a Parkway in the Central Issaquah Development Standards.

Maple Street NW is a two-way three-lane minor arterial connecting NW Maple Street and
NW Gilman Boulevard. Maple Street NW includes a two-way left turn lane throughout, as well
as sidewalks on both sides of the roadway. The posted speed limit along Maple Street NW is
25 mph.

Characteristics of the existing roadway network in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1.

Future
Based on a review of the City of Issaquah 2015-2020 Six Year Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP), no transportation projects that may impact the street system and travel
patterns in the study area were identified to be completed by 2018. Although anticipated after
completion of the proposed project, safety improvements are planned along NW Gilman
Boulevard. In addition, improvements to the NW Maple Street/Newport Way NW intersection
and along Newport Way NW are planned to be funded in future years. These include
improvements to channelization and traffic flow along Newport Way NW.

Additionally, as part of the proposed project, in lieu of traffic impact fees, the project plans to
construct a roundabout at the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection.


Traffic Volumes
The following section summarizes traffic volumes for existing (2015) and future (2018)
without-project conditions.
Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in November 2015. Figure 4
illustrates the existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.
Detailed traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.
Future
Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 2 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at
each study intersection to estimate future (2018) background traffic. This growth rate is based
on discussions with City staff. Traffic from the following pipeline projects in the project vicinity
were also included in the future (2018) without-project volume forecasts:
          Atlas – 640 to 755 NW Gilman Boulevard: Includes construction of approximately 343
           multifamily apartment units.
          Pickering Hill Plats – 910 11th Place NW: Anticipated to construct 20 single family
           units.
          Maple Street Marriott – 1185 NW Maple Street: Includes the construction of a 145
           room hotel.
Traffic studies were not available for the above listed developments. As a result, the trip
generation was estimated based on the size and type of development. Table 2 below
summarizes the estimated trip generation for the pipeline projects. Trips associated with the



                                                                                                                  5

residential pipeline developments were assigned to the network following the trip distribution
developed for this project from the City’s travel demand model (Shown in Figure 6 and Figure
7). A separate trip distribution was developed for the proposed hotel. It is anticipated that the
development would be an extended stay hotel and trips would trend more toward Seattle and
Redmond via I-90 and E Lake Sammamish Parkway SE. It is estimated that approximately 40
percent would go north along NW Maple Street and Renton Road (SR 900) toward I-90, 15
percent would go south along Renton Road (SR 900), 15 percent would go south along
Newport Way NW, and 30 percent would go northbound along E Lake Sammamish Parkway
SE. The increase in vehicular volume is shown in Figure 3 in terms of entering/exiting
vehicles. Future (2017) without-project volumes, including background and pipeline volumes,
are illustrated on Figure 5.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). At signalized intersections, LOS is measured in average
control delay per vehicle and is typically reported using the intersection delay and volume-to-
capacity ratio (V/C). At stop-sign-controlled intersections, LOS is measured in delay per
vehicle. Traffic operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of
levels of service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F
indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing (2015) and future (2018) without-project
conditions were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), with the exception of one intersection, and were
evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program. The Newport Way NW/NW Maple Street
intersection was evaluated utilizing the HCM 2000 methodology based on signal phasing
provided by the City. HCM 2010 methodologies utilize National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (NEMA) phasing, currently the phasing does not follow NEMA phasing.
Consideration could be made to updating signal phasing. Pedestrian and bicycle volumes
were taken into account when evaluating the operations of the intersections.

Table 3 summarizes the existing (2015) and future (2018) without-project traffic operations at
the study intersections. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 3, all study intersections are currently operating at LOS D or better during
the weekday PM peak hour. Under future (2018) without-project conditions all study
intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS D or better with the exception of the Newport
Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection. The Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street
intersection is anticipated to degrade form LOS C to LOS E and would fall below City of
Issaquah standards. The NW Gilman Boulevard/NW Juniper Street intersection is anticipated
to degrade from LOS C to LOS D.

As shown in Table 4, the study intersections experienced an average of approximately 4
collisions or less. Of the 29 collisions no pedestrian, bicycle, or fatalities were reported.

Additionally, the high accident locations (HAL) were reviewed. The following are identified as
HALs in the study area:

        The Newport Way NW/Maple Street NW intersection.
        NW Juniper Street from Rainier Boulevard N to Newport Way NW.
        Newport Way NW between Maple Street NW and W Sunset Way.

Potential project’s impacts to the HALs is identified in a following section.



Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.
Existing
Sidewalks are provided along the nearby streets with crosswalks located at signalized
intersections. Crosswalks are also provided on the westbound leg of the Newport Way
NW/NW Juniper Street and the eastbound approach of the NW Gilman Boulevard/NW
Juniper Street intersection. Bicycle lanes are provided along NW Gilman Boulevard south of
the Maple Street NW intersection. There are multi-use paths present along the north side of
NW Maple Street and the north side of NW Juniper Street, north of the King County Library.
Future
Based on a review of the City of Issaquah 2015-2020 Six Year Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP), no transportation projects that may impact non-motorized facilities in the
study area were identified to be completed by 2018. Although anticipated to be completed
after the proposed project, safety improvements are planned at the Newport Way NW/ Maple
Street NW intersection and along Newport Way NW. These include improvements to
pedestrian and bicycle facilities, focusing on areas adjacent to the nearby elementary school.

                                     Project Impacts
This section documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding street system and
identifies potential mitigation measures where necessary.


Trip Generation
Weekday daily, AM, and PM peak hour trips were estimated for project-generated vehicle
trips using average peak hour trip rates or regression equations for the proposed uses using
information published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation
(9th Edition, 2012). The proposed project would develop 81 apartment units and 12
townhome units. Trip generation was estimated based on the proposed Apartment (LU #220)
and Residential Townhome (LU #230) land uses. The trip generation estimate also takes into
account the removal of the existing Single-Family Home (LU #210). Trip generation for the
proposed residential development is summarized in Table 6.

As shown in Table 6, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 674 net
new daily trips with 47 net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 67
during the weekday PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
Travel patterns of the site generated vehicle traffic to and from the proposed site were based
on the City of Issaquah travel demand model. Figure 6 illustrates the expected inbound trip
distribution to the surrounding local and regional street system, Figure 7 illustrates the
expected outbound trip distribution. An annual growth rate of 2 percent per year was applied
to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at each study intersection to estimate future
(2018) background traffic and the estimated trips were added to estimate future (2018) with-
project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes. These volumes are shown on Figure 8.




                                                                                                    13

Traffic Operations Impact
Future (2018) with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to
analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as
described for existing (2015) and future (2018) without-project conditions. All intersection
parameters such as channelization and traffic control were consistent with those used in the
evaluation of future without-project conditions with one exception. Under future (2018) with-
project conditions, the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection was evaluated as a
roundabout. A comparison of future without- and with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic
operations is summarized for the project site in Table 7. Detailed LOS worksheets are
provided in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 7, with the addition of project traffic, all study intersections are anticipated
to operate at the same LOS as under future (2018) without-project conditions with the
exception of the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection. Overall impacts to the
study intersections would generally be minimal with little to no change in calculated delays or
LOS. The Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection is anticipated to improve from
LOS E to LOS A with completion of the roundabout.

Site Access
Due to the proximity to the proposed roundabout at the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street
intersection, site access C was evaluated as a right-in/right-out only driveway with a
southbound right-turn lane extending from the roundabout at the Newport Way NW/NW
Juniper Street intersection. It is anticipated that vehicles utilizing site access C with the desire
to go north could turn right out of the site and utilize NW Holly Street and 7th Avenue NW to
turn around and head north. Site access C is anticipated to operate at LOS B with
approximately 13 seconds of delay.

Site access B was evaluated as a full access driveway and is anticipated to operate at LOS C
with approximately 16 seconds of delay.

The Central Issaquah Development and Design Standards (CIDDS) does not specifically
mention a minimum required driveway width. However, the City of Issaquah Department of
Public Works Street Standards (Transportation, October 2010), Design Section B – Access
Control (Driveways), Paragraph 6, Part A for Two-Way Driveways, does have a minimum as
stated below:




                                                                                                                           17

         Two-Way Driveways: The minimum two-way driveway width shall be twelve feet (12’)
         minimum and twenty feet (20’) maximum for residential uses and twenty-four feet (24’)
         minimum (can be reduced to twenty feet (20’) under special circumstances approved
         by the City Engineer) and thirty-five feet (35’) maximum for commercial uses. A wider
         commercial driveway width may be required by the Engineer where a substantial
         percentage of oversized vehicle traffic exists. In this case, the driveway should be sized
         to accommodate the largest vehicles. A maximum width of twenty-four feet (24’) for
         driveways on designated pedestrian streets in Olde Town consistent with Olde Town
         Design Standards.

Since driveways for this project are for residential use, widths should not exceed 20 feet.

In addition, driveways should be constructed to meet Americans with Disability Act (ADA)
requirements as shown in City of Issaquah Standard Detail T-05

In discussions with City staff, a concern was expressed regarding the proximity of Site
Access B to the King County Library access located across Newport Way NW and slightly
south from the Library access. The offset driveways have the potential of creating a conflict
with opposing left-turning vehicles trying to enter the accesses at the same time. The
southern access at the Library is not the main access, the main access is located to the
north. Existing counts collected in November 2015 indicate that there were less than 10
vehicles utilizing the southern driveway. The counts indicate that less than 5 vehicles made a
southbound left-turn into the Library access and less than 5 westbound right-turns out of the
access, no westbound left-turning movements are indicated on the counts. The spacing
between the two access is not adequate to provide dedicated left-turn lanes for both
accesses. It is therefore recommended that the two-way left-turn lane be extended across
both accesses to provide left-turn access to Building B and the King County Library.


Safety Analysis
The high accident locations (HAL) were reviewed. If 10 or more peak hour project trips are
added to a HAL, the City considers this a probable significant adverse impact. The project is
anticipated to add 10 or more peak hour trips to the following HALs with 10 or more peak
hour trips:

        The Newport Way NW/Maple Street NW intersection.
        A section of NW Juniper Street from Newport Way NW to 7th Avenue NW. After 7th
         Avenue NW there are anticipated to be less than 10 peak hour project trips.
        A portion of Newport Way NW from NW Juniper Street to NW Holly Street. After NW
         Holly Street there are anticipated to be less than 10 peak hour project trips. The
         Section of Newport Way NW from NW Juniper Street to Maple Street NW.

As mentioned previously, the project is constructing improvements to the Newport Way
NW/NW Juniper Street.

Additionally, no significant adverse safety impacts are anticipated given the following:

        Minor increase in traffic volumes at the study intersections. Traffic volume impacts
         are anticipated to be approximately 3 percent or less at the study intersection.
        Proposed construction of a roundabout at the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street.
        No notable increases in delay are anticipated at the study intersections, with the
         exception of the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street which will improve in
         operations assuming completion of a roundabout.
        Both site access locations are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better.

Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply and parking code requirements.

Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by 2 garages inclusive of 121 parking
stalls. The Building B garage includes 113 stalls throughout 2 parking levels, 55 stalls on the
lower level, and 58 stalls on the upper level. The Building C garage includes 8 stalls across 1
parking level. Both Building B and Building C garages include compact stalls, ADA accessible
stalls, motorcycle parking, and bicycle parking.

Parking Code Analysis
The parking requirement for the proposed project is based on City of Issaquah Development
and Design Standards. The City of Issaquah requires 1 space per unit for multifamily housing
units. Figure 8 summarizes the parking requirements.

Source: Development Standards: 8.0 Parking Standards.


As shown in Figure 8, the proposed development would include 81 residential apartment
units and 12 residential townhome units. This results in a total of 93 required parking stalls.
The project is proposing 121 parking stalls, which meets and exceeds parking requirements.

According to the CIDDS figure 6A, Auto Inclusive Circulation Facility Classification Map, this
section of Newport Way NW is classified as a parkway. Per Section 6.4 Circulation Facility
Classification Standards, Part H for Parkways, no on-street parking lanes are required. It
should be noted that when parking lanes are required, such as for part F. Auto Inclusive
Circulation Facilities: Core Streets, 8-foot lanes are required. The proposed parking lanes are
8-foot lanes.

Per Table 8.16-1, Computation of Loading Zones, a multi-family building of more than 40 units
requires 2 Type A loading spaces. Per item 7 of Section 8.16, Type A Loading Space shall be
at least 25 feet in depth and 10 feet in width, except that on-street loading spaces may be the
width of adjacent parallel parking. Therefore, on-street loading spaces should be provided for
Building B measuring 25 feet in depth and 8 feet in width, matching the proposed adjacent
parallel parking.

                         Findings and Conclusions
This transportation impact study summarizes the project traffic impacts of the proposed
Inneswood Apartments residential development proposed along Newport Way NW. General
findings and recommendations include:

              The proposed project would develop 81 multi-family residential units and 12
               townhomes.
              The project is anticipated to generate approximately 674 weekday daily trips
               with 47 occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 67 during the PM peak
               hour.
              As part of the project it is planned that a roundabout would be constructed at the
               Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection.
              All study intersections currently operate at LOS D or better. Under future (2018)
               without-project conditions the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection
               is anticipated to degrade from LOS C to LOS E and the NW Gilman
               Boulevard/NW Juniper Street intersection is anticipated to degrade from LOS C
               to LOS D. Under future (2018) with-project conditions, including construction of
               the proposed roundabout, the Newport Way NW/NW Juniper Street intersection
               is anticipated to improve to LOS A. The remaining intersections are anticipated
               to operate at the same LOS as under future without-project conditions.
              Site access B was evaluated as a full access driveway and is anticipated to
               operate at LOS C. Site access C was evaluated as a right-in/right-out only
               driveway and is anticipated to operate at LOS B. It is anticipated that vehicles
               utilizing site access C with the desire to go north could turn right out of the site
               and utilize NW Holly Street and 7th Avenue NW to turn around and head north.
              The proposed project plans to construct the proposed roundabout. In doing so,
               the project will receive credit toward the traffic impact fees.

Appendix B: LOS Definitions

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.

Level of Service (LOS) Method: Delay & v/c (HCM 2010).
Roundabout LOS Method: Same as Signalised Intersections.
Vehicle movement LOS values are based on average delay and v/c ratio (degree of saturation) per movement
LOS F will result if v/c > 1 irrespective of movement delay value (does not apply for approaches and intersection).
Intersection and Approach LOS values are based on average delay for all movements (v/c not used as specified in HCM 2010).
Roundabout Capacity Model: SIDRA Standard.
SIDRA Standard Delay Model is used. Control Delay includes Geometric Delay.
Gap-Acceptance Capacity: SIDRA Standard (Akçelik M3D).
HV (%) values are calculated for All Movement Classes of All Heavy Vehicle Model Designation.
