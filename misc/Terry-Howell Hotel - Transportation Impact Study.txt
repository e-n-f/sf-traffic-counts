FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS
This traffic impact analysis has been prepared for the proposed Terry-Howell hotel development.

        Project Proposal. The proposed hotel is located on the northwest corner of Terry Avenue and
        Howell Street. Based on the current site plan, the proposed development would include up to 309
        hotel rooms. The existing site currently functions as a surface parking lot. The anticipated year of
        project occupancy for the project is 2017.

        Trip Generation. The proposed 309 room hotel is anticipated to generate a total of 2,525 daily
        vehicle trips, with 164 new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour, and 185 new trips
        during the weekday PM peak hour.

        Access. Vehicle access to/from the site is proposed via a driveway curb cut onto Terry Avenue
        which would provide access to a porte cochere along the west side of the site and through access
        to the alley. This throughway access between Terry Avenue and the alley will provide direct access
        to the parking garage driveway. Trips entering the site can either use the curb cut access at Terry
        Avenue or the existing alley, which intersects with Stewart Street and Howell Street; exiting trips are
        anticipated to primarily use the alley.

        Intersection Level of Service (LOS). Eight study intersections were evaluated for PM hour LOS
        in the future with or without the proposed project. The results of the LOS analyses indicated that all
        six of the signalized study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better in 2017 without
        or with the proposed project. All turn movements at the two unsignalized intersections are anticipated
        to operate at LOS B or better in 2017 without or with the proposed project.

        Transit & Non-Motorized Impacts. Existing transit service in the vicinity area is anticipated to
        accommodate the anticipated increase in ridership demand from the project. The project location is
        well served with adequate bicycle and pedestrian facilities to accommodate the increased demand
        generated by the project.

        Transportation Concurrency. Transportation concurrency was evaluated for the proposed 400
        Dexter Office project based on City guidelines outlined in the Director’s Rule 2009-5. The calculated
        v/c ratios for the tested screenlines were determined to remain below the adopted LOS standard
        with the proposed development. Therefore, the proposed development was determined to meet the
        City of Seattle concurrency requirements.

        Parking. The project proposal includes a total of 149 parking stalls in an underground garage. The
        peak parking demand for the project is estimated to be 146 parking stalls based on a peak parking
        demand rate of 0.64 stalls per occupied hotel room assuming 74 percent occupancy. As a result,
        the on-site parking supply is expected to adequately serve the peak parking demand.

        Project Mitigation. There are no proposed measures necessary to mitigate project impacts. The
        off-site intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better, transportation concurrency
        requirements are met, proposed parking supply would meet peak demand, and no project trips are
        anticipated to impact projects planned in the SLU area.

INTRODUCTION
     This traffic study documents the traffic impacts associated with the proposed Terry-Howell Hotel
     development. The project site is located on the northwest corner of Terry Avenue and Howell Street;
     see also Figure 1 site vicinity map.

Project Description
     The proposed Terry-Howell Hotel development includes a 309 room hotel on a site that currently
     includes a public pay parking lot. Vehicle access to/from the site is proposed via a porte cochere
     access along the west side of the site that will provide a curb cut onto Terry Avenue and access to
     the alley. This throughway access between Terry Avenue and the alley will provide direct access to
     the parking garage driveway. Trips entering the site can either use the curb cut access at Terry
     Avenue or the existing alley, which intersects with Stewart Street and Howell Street; exiting trips are
     anticipated to primarily use the alley as shown on the preliminary site plan concept in Figure 2. The
     anticipated year of occupancy for the project is 2017.

Project Approach
     Based on discussions with John Shaw of the City of Seattle Department of Planning and Development
     (DPD), the following tasks were undertaken to evaluate and disclose the traffic impacts associated
     with the Terry-Howell Hotel development:
                     Assessed existing conditions through field reconnaissance and reviewed existing
                      planning documents;
                     Described and assessed existing transportation conditions in the study area;
                     Documented existing public transit service and non-motorized facilities;
                     Estimated trip generation for weekday daily and peak hour conditions;
                     Documented trip distribution and assignment of project-generated traffic;
                     Documented traffic forecasts and assumptions for year 2017 PM peak hour
                      conditions with and without the proposed development;
                     Conducted PM peak hour level of service (LOS) analyses at the following study
                      intersections:
                          1. Terry Avenue / Stewart Street

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Roadway Network
     The primary vehicle travel routes to and from the site include Terry Avenue, Stewart Street, and Howell
     Street. These roadways serving the project site are described below:
             Terry Avenue is a one-way northwest bound street classified as a Green Street and Minor
             Transit Street. In the project vicinity, Terry Avenue has sidewalks and 4-hour maximum
             parallel street parking on both sides of the street.
             Stewart Street is a one-way southwest bound street classified as Principal Arterial, Class 1
             Pedestrian Street, and Principal Transit Street with a sharrow bicycle lane. In the project
             vicinity, Stewart Street has sidewalks, bike lanes, and 4-hour maximum parallel street parking
             on both sides of the street.
             Howell Street is a one-way northeast bound street classified as Principal Arterial, Class 2
             Pedestrian Street, and Principal Transit Street with sharrow bicycle lanes. Adjacent to the
             site, Howell Street has sidewalks on both sides of the street. Howell Street has 4-hour
             maximum parallel street parking on the southeast side of the street and two sharrow bicycle
             bikes lane on the northwest side.

Transit Service
     The project site is served by both Metro and Sound Transit. The nearest bus stop is located on the
     southeast side of Howell Street just south of 9th Avenue. The stop serves routes 25, 66, 71, 72, 73,
     83, 111, 114, 510, 511, and 513 with frequent service to/from downtown, Laurelhurst,
     Northgate, University District, Lake City, Renton Highlands, and Everett. There are several other
     transit stops within a half-mile of the site on 9th Avenue and Olive Way. These public transit facilities
     provide frequent service to areas throughout the region. One block south of the site is the Convention
     Place bus station which provides connection to transit services that serve the region.

Non-motorized Transportation Facilities
     Non-motorized transportation facilities in the project vicinity include sidewalks on all adjacent streets,
     crosswalks at signalized intersections, and sharrow bicycle lanes on Stewart Street and Howell Street.

Existing Peak-Hour Traffic Volumes
     Existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections were collected by IDAX in November
     and December 2014. Figure 3 illustrates the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes at the six study
     intersections. The detailed traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix A.

Level of Service
     Based on traffic scoping discussions with City transportation staff, level of service (LOS) analyses
     were conducted at the following study intersections:
                1.   Terry Avenue / Stewart Street
                2.   9th Avenue / Stewart Street
                3.   Terry Avenue / Howell Street
                4.   9th Avenue / Howell Street
                5.   Terry Avenue / Olive Way
                6.   9th Avenue / Olive Way

     LOS generally refers to the degree of congestion on a roadway or intersection. It is a measure of
     vehicle operating speed, travel time, travel delays, and driving comfort. A letter scale from A to F
     generally describes intersection LOS. At signalized intersections, LOS A represents free-flow
     conditions (motorists experience little or no delays), and LOS F represents forced-flow conditions
     where motorists experience an average delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle.

     The LOS reported for signalized intersections represents the average control delay (sec/veh) and can
     be reported for the overall intersection, for each approach, and for each lane group or movement
     (additional v/c ratio criteria apply to lane group or movement LOS only). The LOS reported at two-
     way stop-controlled intersections is based on the average control delay and can be reported for each
     controlled minor approach, controlled minor lane group, and controlled major-street movement
     (additional v/c ratio criteria apply to lane group or movement LOS only). Table 1 outlines current
     HCM 2010 LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections based on these methods.

     2 For approach-based and intersection-wide assessments at signals, LOS is defined solely by control delay.
     3 For two-way stop intersections, LOS criteria apply to each lane on a given approach and to each approach on minor
     street. LOS not calculated for major-street approaches or for intersection as a whole at two-way stop controlled intersections.


     LOS calculations for the study intersections were calculated using the methodology and procedures
     outlined in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board (TRB), using
     the Synchro 8 software program. Existing signal timing was provided by the SDOT.

TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
Project Trip Generation
     The proposed Terry-Howell Hotel development includes a 309 room hotel. The existing site contains
     a public pay parking lot that will be removed, and therefore no trip reduction was taken for the
     existing use.

     Trip generation for the proposed Terry-Howell Hotel development was determined using trip
     generation rates from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th
     Edition. Weekday Daily, AM peak, and PM peak hour trip generation rates were used to determine
     the amount of vehicles the proposed site would generate. To be conservative, no trip reduction was
     taken due to mode-split for a downtown location.

     Table 3 summarizes the Terry-Howell Hotel trip generation for a typical weekday. Detailed trip
     generation calculations are provided in Appendix B.
                     Table 3

                     Weekday Daily                    1,262      1,263     2,525

                     Weekday AM Peak Hour              97         67          164

                     Weekday PM Peak Hour              94         91          185


     As shown in Table 3, the proposed development is estimated to generate a total of 2,525 weekday
     trips per day, with 164 new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 185 new trips
     occurring during the weekday PM peak hour.

Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
     The distribution of vehicle trips for the proposed hotel was estimated based on DPD Director’s Rule
     2009-5 and general traffic patterns in the vicinity of the site, as well as anticipated access to/from
     I-5. The distribution and PM peak hour project trip assignment of inbound and outbound trips for the
     proposed hotel is shown in Figure 4.

Future Traffic Volumes
     Year 2017 without-project peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by applying a one percent
     annual growth rate to the existing traffic counts based on direction from the City staff. In addition,
     trips from the following five pipeline projects were included in the future traffic volumes at all of the
     study intersections:

         1. Amazon (Rufus 2.0)
         2. 807 Stewart Street (Office)
         3. 1821 Boren Avenue (Office)
         4. 1812 Boren Avenue (Mixed-Use)
         5. 1007 Stewart Street (Mixed-Use)


     The 2017 With-Project traffic volumes were determined by adding the trip assignment from the
     proposed 309-room Hotel to the future 2017 Without-Project traffic volumes. The 2017 without-
     project traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5. Adding the trip assignment from the proposed Terry-
     Howell Hotel development (shown in Figure 4) to the future 2017 without-project traffic volumes
     results in the 2017 With-Project traffic volumes at the study intersections shown in Figure 6.

Future Level of Service
     Future LOS were evaluated at the eight study intersections and site access intersection for the
     anticipated year of occupancy (2017). The future roadway network assumed in the year 2017 LOS
     analysis was assumed to be the same as existing conditions with the exception that Terry Avenue
     would be reduced to 2 travel lanes as a result of the narrowing of the green street with the project
     and the adjacent development. The 2017 weekday PM peak hour LOS results at the study
     intersections are summarized in Table 4.

     Vehicle access to/from the site is proposed via a driveway curb cut onto Terry Avenue which would
     provide access to a porte cochere along the west side of the site and through access to the alley.
     This throughway access between Terry Avenue and the alley will provide direct access to the parking
     garage driveway. Trips entering the site can either use the curb cut access at Terry Avenue or the
     existing alley, which intersects with Stewart Street and Howell Street; exiting trips are anticipated to
     primarily use the alley.

     Two separate memorandums were prepared that documented a comprehensive site access
     evaluation for the proposed Terry-Howell Hotel that considered several alternatives related to City
     code criteria for vehicle access. These site access memorandums are provided in Appendix D. The
     memorandums evaluated three access alternatives: (1) alley only access; (2) Howell Street access;
     and (3) Terry Ave access. Each of the 3 alternatives were evaluated based on City Code criteria for
     vehicle access in the categories of: (1) Pedestrian Safety and Comfort, (2) Transit Operations, (3)
     Movement of Vehicles, (4) On-Street Vehicle Queuing, (5) Vehicle Safety, and (6) Minimizing
     Hazards. It was determined that the Terry Avenue Access Alternative would meet the City design
     criteria most effectively. More detailed descriptions and analysis of the access alternatives evaluation
     is provided in Appendix D.
     It should also be noted that there is a recently-adopted Code criteria that specifically addresses
     access for hotels:
             c. The Director may allow or require access from a right-of-way other than one
             indicated by subsection 23.49.019.H.1.a or 23.49.019.H.1.b if, after consulting with the
             Director of Transportation on whether and to what extent alternative locations of
             access would enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, facilitate transit operations,
             facilitate the movement of vehicles, minimize the on-street queuing of vehicles,
             enhance vehicular safety, or minimize hazards, and, for hotel use, improve passenger
             loading safety or increase visibility of vehicular access for guests arriving by car, the
             Director finds that an exception to the general policy is warranted. The Director may
             approve an exception for hotel use and impose conditions to minimize any adverse
             impacts to the pedestrian environment or street operations, including but not limited to
             allowing one-way driveways that are less than the minimum width otherwise required.
             Curb cut controls on designated green streets shall be evaluated on a case-by-case
             basis, but generally access from green streets is not allowed if access from any other
             right-of-way is possible.

     After a thorough evaluation of the different access alternatives, and based on the recently adopted
     revisions to the City Code criteria, the proposed Terry Avenue access alternative would meet the City
     design criteria most effectively by reducing on-street queuing from loading vehicles and taxis,
     maintaining good vehicle movement and traffic flow, minimize hazards, and enhancing pedestrian
     safety and comfort along Terry Avenue.

     All turning movements at the proposed site access curb cut onto Terry Avenue, as well as the alley
     intersections with Stewart and Howell Streets are expected to operate at LOS B or better during the
     PM peak hour as shown in the previous LOS Table 4. The detailed LOS files at the alley intersections
     and new site driveway are included in Appendix C.

Future Transit Service
        The proposed hotel could add some new transit users to the vicinity area. While this project may
        slightly increase the demand for transit service in the area, the transit capacity is expected to
        accommodate this increased demand with no significant adverse impact.

Future Non-Motorized Facilities
        The demand on pedestrian facilities in the project vicinity is expected to increase with the proposed
        hotel. While this project would increase the demand on pedestrian facilities, this increased demand
        is not expected to result in a significant adverse impact. Existing pedestrian facilities in the vicinity
        area (i.e. sidewalks) are sufficient to accommodate the additional pedestrian demand.

Transportation Concurrency
        Prior to development approval, a transportation concurrency analysis is conducted based on DPD
        Director’s Rule 2009-5. Transportation concurrency standards are used to determine the acceptable
        balance between the demand for use of the arterial systems and the capacity of the transportation
        system. Total capacity is based on the facilities currently in existence, and known future projects.

        Transportation concurrency review in the City of Seattle is evaluated first by determining applicable
        screenlines. A screenline is an imaginary line drawn across several arterials at a particular place
        where the volume to-capacity ratio (v/c) is calculated. For the Terry-Howell Hotel development,
        Screenline 10.11 (South of S Jackson St – Alaskan Way S to 4th Ave S) and Screenline 12.12 (East
        of CBD) were evaluated.

        Baseline peak-hour traffic volumes for the screenlines were obtained from Director’s Rule 2009-5.
        Project-generated traffic was then added to baseline traffic volumes at the screenlines. The total traffic
        volume, including PM peak hour trips from the proposed Terry-Howell Hotel development, was then
        divided by the capacity of all roadways crossing the screenlines to obtain a volume to capacity (v/c)
        ratio. This ratio was then compared to the LOS standard.

        Table 5 summarizes the transportation concurrency review results. As shown, the v/c ratios with the
        development are below the adopted LOS standard.

Parking Demand Analysis
    Peak parking demand for the proposed hotel was calculated based on information from the ITE
    Parking Generation manual (4th edition, year 2010). The ITE Parking Generation manual was used
    to identify the suburban parking demand rate for a hotel based on the number of occupied rooms
    during the weekday peak period. The estimated parking demand rate for the Terry-Howell Hotel
    development was determined to be 0.64 parking stalls/occupied room based on the ITE study of 4
    urban sites with good transit service and average size of 458 hotel rooms.

    To determine the peak parking demand of the proposed Terry-Howell Hotel development, 74 percent
    occupancy was assumed (based on current market information provided by the applicant). A 309
    room hotel with 74 percent occupancy, and peak demand of 0.64 stalls per occupied room results
    in a peak parking demand of 146 parking stalls. The current site plan provides 149 parking stalls
    on-site in an underground garage. The peak parking demand is expected to be adequately served
    by on-site parking supply in the underground garage.

MITIGATION MEASURES
   There are no proposed measures necessary to mitigate project impacts. The proposed access onto
   Terry Avenue would safely and adequately serve the project site with additional access on the alley.
   The off-site study intersections are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better, transportation
   concurrency requirements are met, proposed parking supply would meet peak demand, and no
   project trips are anticipated to impact projects planned in the SLU area.
