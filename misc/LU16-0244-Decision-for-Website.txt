                                                         FINDINGS

Proposal:

1. The applicant requests a Conditional Use Permit to construct and operate a hospital on an
   approximately five-acre site zoned R-4 Multiple Family Dwelling District.
2. Proposed work includes:
     •    Demolition of all structures on the site, totaling approximately 17,000 square feet;
     •    Appropriate disposal of construction and demolition waste;
     •    Site preparation and grading in excess of 30,000 cubic yards, to include utilities and
          stormwater management;
     •    Construction of a new hospital building of approximately 64,000 square feet;
     •    Construction of approximately 133 parking spaces;
     •    Signage as allowed per the Tacoma Municipal Code; and
     •    Installation of required site amenities, including required landscaping and off-site
          improvements such as sidewalks.
3. The facility would provide inpatient rehabilitation services for patients who have been
   impaired by an injury or illness but who do not need acute care in a standard hospital. These
   patients would be provided with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.
   The hospital would not have an emergency room.
4. Outdoor recreation and therapy space will be provided, along with a storm water detention

     area.
5. The building will be located approximately 95 feet from the north property line, 100 feet from
   the west property line, 40 feet from the east property line, and 218 feet from the south
   property line. Required setbacks are 20 feet from any property line.
6. Landscaping trees, shrubs, and groundcover would be provided for the perimeter of the site
   as well as internal to the site and parking lot.

Project Site:
7. The site is located within the R-4 Multiple Family Dwelling District. Hospitals are a
   Conditional Use in the R-4 District.
8. The City’s Comprehensive Plan locates the subject site within a Multi-Family High Density
   area; this area allows for a density of 45-75 units per acre.
9. The site is located within the West End Neighborhood District.
10. The site has been used since 1973 by the Afifi Shrine of Tacoma as the site of a fraternal
    club, as permitted through Special Use Permit in 1973.
11. The site was rezoned from R-2 Single Family Dwelling District to the current R-4 designation
    in August of 2016, in order to bring the zoning into conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.

Surrounding Area:
12. The surrounding area contains a mix of residential and institutional uses.
13. The property is abutted on the north by the Highland Crest Apartments, an approximately
    72-unit apartment complex.
14. Vassault Street dead-ends in the Highland Crest Apartments; it does not continue to the
    north to 6th Avenue.
15. The property to the east is a Masonic lodge.
16. To the south, the property is abutted by parking lots and open space for the Morgan Family
    YMCA and the Temple Beth El Congregation.
17. To the west, across Vassault, is the playfield for Hunt Middle School. The current school is
    used as a “swing school” to house Tacoma School District students whose schools are
    undergoing renovation or reconstruction. The school is planned to be reconstructed on the
    site after 2020.
18. Vassault Street continues to South 12th Street, where it dead-ends at the Tacoma
    Community College Campus. Vassault also serves an additional multi-family property in this
    two-block section.

Additional Information:
19. One Tacoma, the City’s comprehensive plan, notes the area as “multi-family high-density”
    which is described as:
     . . . a wide range of residential housing types at medium and higher density levels,
     along with community facilities and institutions, and some limited commercial uses
     and mixed-use buildings. It is characterized by taller buildings, higher traffic volumes,
     reduced setbacks, limited private yard space, and greater noise levels. These areas
     are generally found in the central city and along major transportation corridors where
     there is increased access to public transportation and to employment centers.

20. The Tacoma Municipal Code, TMC13.06.700.H defines a hospital as follows:
     Hospitals. Medical facilities, licensed by the Department of Health Services, the
     Committee on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, the Department of Aging, or
     other similar organizations, for the provision of surgery, rehabilitation and physical
     care, acute psychiatric care, chemical dependency, and substance abuse on an
     out-patient basis, including ancillary nursing, training, and administrative facilities.
     Such facilities are generally licensed by the state under the provisions of RCW
     70.41.
21. The applicant’s justification for the CUP application is marked as an Exhibit to this report
    and decision. The CUP criteria response was modified following the initial round of staff and
    public comments, and further amended in January of 2017. In summary, the applicant
    asserts the following:
     •    There is a need for a rehabilitation hospital in the community, as evidenced by the
          granting of a Certificate of Need by the Washington State Department of Health.
          Washington state healthcare data show that more than 650 Pierce County residents
          were admitted to rehabilitation facilities in the first three quarters of 2016. More than half
          of those patients lived within six miles of the subject site.
     •    The proposed facility represents an increase (nearly double) in rehabilitation beds over
          those currently housed at St. Joseph Medical Center; the capacity at St. Joseph would
          then be available for other hospital needs.
     •    Inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, while providing 24-hour medical and nursing care, have
          a lower overhead and patient cost than a full-service acute-care hospital.
     •    The proposed use is consistent with the R-4 District and the goals and policies of the
          Comprehensive Plan, especially by providing landscape buffers and off-site
          improvements to help the facility fit in with the surrounding area.
     •    The proposed use will not generate any adverse effects on the neighborhood, including
          noise (siren usage is expected to be consistent with that already in the neighborhood),
          odors, light or glare on the surrounding properties.
     •    The traffic study provided shows that traffic impacts will be insignificant in terms of the
          overall area.
22. SEPA regulations have been triggered for the demolition and construction of buildings larger
    than 12,000 square feet and for grade/fill of more than 500 cubic yards. In accordance with
    the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) administered under the Washington
    Administrative Code (WAC) 197-11 and the City of Tacoma Environmental Regulations
    administered under TMC Chapter 13.12, the City is issuing a Determination of Non-
    Significance (DNS) for the proposed action concurrent with this decision. See Exhibit “xx” to
    this report and decision.

Notification and Comments:
23. The application was determined to be complete on October 20, 2016. Written notice of the
    application has been mailed to owners of property within 400 feet of the site as indicated by
    the Pierce County Assessor/Treasurer’s records, the neighborhood council, and qualified
    neighborhood groups, allowing for at least 30 days of comment period. Public notice was
    posted on the site within seven days of the start of the comment period.
24. Multiple public comments were received, including approximately 110 postcards. The
   comments (with a sample postcard) are included as Exhibit H.
25. The Director understands the substance of the comments to be the following:


LU16-0244 Conditional Use Permit
Franciscan Specialty Care Rehabilitation Hospital
Page 4
     •    General concerns about neighborhood change, air pollution, noise pollution, foot traffic,
          and traffic disruption.
     •    Concern that the response to the CUP criteria was inadequate and failed to demonstrate
          community need, lack of impacts, compliance with either zoning code or responsiveness
          to Comprehensive Plan policies and regulations.
     •    Erroneous comparison of the impacts of the proposed hospital to another hospital, not to
          other potential outright-permitted uses in the district.
     •    Lack of description of the surrounding neighborhood, and lack of consideration for the
          existing neighborhood function and character.
     •    Concerns with on-site soil contamination resulting from the Asarco Plume in terms of air
          quality, water quality, and health risk for both construction workers and future users of
          the site.
     •    Concerns that substantial additional traffic would be generated by the proposal, and non-
          motorized access is not addressed.
     •    Concern that the applicant had not met with neighborhood representatives and provided
          information regarding the project.
26. Due to the nature and extent of the comments, and due to an error in the mailing radius per
    the notice requirements of the Tacoma Municipal Code, an additional public notice was sent
    to all owners of property within 1000 feet of the site as indicated by the Pierce County
    Assessor/Treasurer’s records, the neighborhood council, and qualified neighborhood
    groups, allowing for at least 30 days of comment period. The public notice included
    notification of a public informational meeting on February 23, 2017, with the notice period
    ending March 2, 2017. No additional comments were received.
27. Local governmental agencies, City Staff, and utility providers have reviewed the requested
    permit. Comments were received from the Department of Ecology, Tacoma-Pierce County
    Health Department, and City Staff. They are included as Exhibit I to this Report and
    Decision and conditions, where applicable, are included in this Report and Decision.
28. The applicant was given the opportunity to respond to comments. In response, the applicant
    provided a revised Conditional Use Permit criteria narrative (Exhibit A), a final Corrective
    Action Plan for soils cleanup (Exhibit D), and revised stormwater and civil drawings (not
    included, as they are relevant to building permits).
29. With exception of the community-outreach concern, the Director would note that the
    applicant’s revised submittal responded to the community comments as well as the staff
    comments.

Applicable Regulations and Policies - Analysis:
30. TMC 13.06.100.A.8 states that one of the purposes of the residential districts is to “Allow for
    the enhancement of residential neighborhoods with parks, open space, schools, religious
    institutions and other uses as deemed compatible with the overall residential character.”
     Analysis: Provided the hospital can be deemed within the overall character of the area, the
     proposed use fits within the intent of the residential districts.
31. TMC Section 13.06.100.C.4 identifies hospitals as a conditional use within the R-4 District.
32. TMC Section 13.06.640 Conditional Uses
     C. Criteria. A conditional use permit shall be subject to the following criteria:
          1. There shall be a demonstrated need for the use within the community at large which
             shall not be contrary to the public interest.

LU16-0244 Conditional Use Permit
Franciscan Specialty Care Rehabilitation Hospital
Page 5
               Analysis: The facility would provide additional beds in an inpatient facility, separate
               from an acute-care hospital. Statistics show that many patients live within the area
               and would benefit from having a facility close to their home. In turn, space would be
               created within a hospital to serve acute care needs.
               Further, the Director would note that, with the exception of the apartment complex to
               the north, the site is surrounded with institutional uses of a moderate to large scale.
               While it is possible that the site to the east could be redeveloped with residential
               uses, it is unlikely that any of the remaining properties would be redeveloped in the
               foreseeable future. In addition, residential development in the vicinity could consist of
               buildings of a much greater scale, density, and traffic generation than that proposed
               (the target density for the R-4 district is an average of 60 units per acre with buildings
               up to 60 feet tall, about 5 stories). If conditioned appropriately, the proposed use
               would be no more impactful than otherwise-permitted development in the area.
          2. The use shall be consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan
             and applicable ordinances of the City of Tacoma.
             Analysis: The Comprehensive Plan does not speak directly to institutional uses but
             does state that they are appropriate in the high-density multi-family areas.
             The Comprehensive Plan does have several design and development goals for
             institutional development and how development fits in with surrounding areas. The
             building has been designed to be central to the site with perimeter landscaping and
             screening. The proposed building would be two stories tall, within the scale of
             existing institutional buildings in the area. Further, the development would include
             off-site improvements to increase pedestrian access to the site.
             The proposed hospital will meet all requirements of the zoning code for landscaping,
             parking, circulation, and design.
          3. The use shall be located, planned and developed in such a manner that the special
             use is not inconsistent with the health, safety, convenience, or general welfare of
             persons residing or working in the community. The following shall be considered in
             making a decision on a special property use:
             a. The generation of noise, noxious or offensive emissions, or other nuisances
                which may be injurious or to the detriment of a significant portion of the
                community.
             b. Availability of public services which may be necessary or desirable for the
                support of the use. These may include, but shall not be limited to, availability of
                utilities, transportation systems (including vehicular, pedestrian, and public
                transportation systems), education, police and fire facilities, and social and health
                services.
                Analysis: All utilities are available to serve the site, or can be extended to serve
                the site. The applicant will make required improvements to the local
                transportation infrastructure, including sidewalk improvements. The traffic impact
                analysis has been reviewed by the City’s Traffic Engineer and concurs with the
                analysis and conclusions that the surrounding street network has the capacity to
                serve the increased traffic with a minimal impact.
                The proposed use is not expected to have additional demands on other nearby
                public services.
             c. The adequacy of landscaping, screening, yard setbacks, open spaces, or other
                development characteristics necessary to mitigate the impact of the use upon


LU16-0244 Conditional Use Permit
Franciscan Specialty Care Rehabilitation Hospital
Page 6
                    neighboring properties.
                    Analysis: The proposal will provide all required buffer and screening landscaping
                    for the site. The site will include a nearly 40-foot landscaped area between the
                    parking area and the north property line, abutting the nearest residential use. The
                    parking lot is separated from the west property line by a 20-foot landscape area,
                    and provides approximately 50 feet between the parking lot and the street.

                                                     CONCLUSIONS 2
1. Provided the conditions of approval are met, the proposal meets the criteria identified in

Conditional Use Criteria

Kindred rehabilitation Hospital of Tacoma

The proposed Project includes the demolition of all existing structures and features located on the
subject parcel and proposes to locate a two story, 60 bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital on the site.
Because the site has been rezoned, R-4, we have planned the project to comply with the zoning
requirements. The R-4 zoning allows construction of hospitals as a conditional use. The Proposed
project will include approximately 64,000 gross square feet and will require 135 parking spaces.

The existing site includes a number of aging structures, some of which do not comply with current
zoning restrictions. This project will remove the existing structures and locate all new structures with in
the appropriate setbacks. The existing building covers approximately 15,500 sf and the new building
covers approximately 37,500 sf. The existing impervious paving is approximately 113,000 sf and the
proposed is approximately 125,000 sf. The resulting site will provide approximately 12,000 sf of
increased impervious area on the overall site. The ratio of pervious to impervious area will be
approximately 40%.

The proposed site plan will increase the setbacks and as a result allow for improved landscape buffering
to adjacent properties. Additionally, the facility creates minimal traffic (as most patients stay an average
of 14-20 days) and the peak traffic tend to be off peak for normal traffic times.

The Certificate of Need (CON) was awarded by the State of Washington to serve the community’s
rehabilitation needs which include Brain trauma, stroke and physical therapy patients. Because of its
use, limited use of emergency vehicles will be needed and therefor, will limit noise disturbances
associated with a typical hospital. the site lighting and building lighting will be designed so that it stays
on site and will not be a disturbance to adjacent properties. There will be a 24/7 presence at the
hospital adding to neighborhood safety. This hospital will bring 200 jobs to the community through its
partnership with a trusted healthcare provider, St. Joseph Medical Center. Adding a hospital on this site
will add to a network of centers planned for the city, enhances livability of surrounding residential
neighborhoods and vitality of nearby businesses. It takes advantage of its proximity to two major
corridors in the city, 6th and Pearl as defined by the city’s Comprehensive Plan.

All regular parking needs and patient activities will be met on site including an exterior therapy
courtyard. The site will use upgraded sidewalks and pedestrian pathways on and adjacent to the site,
use upgraded landscaping and its orientation to S. Vassault to engage the neighborhood. The 2 story
height and scale and building materials (primarily Brick and EIFS) will complement the neighborhood’s
existing and planned characteristics.

As a result of the above and supporting documents, we believe the proposed project brings value to the
community, both by improving the site as well as by bringing patient healthcare closer to patient’s
homes.

RE:     FRANCISCAN SPECIALTY CARE, LLC REHABILITATION HOSPITAL
        CONDITIONAL USE CRITERIA

Franciscan Specialty Care, LLC Rehabilitation Hospital
Conditional Use Permit Criteria

13.06.640 Conditional Use Permit
A. Purpose. In many zones there are uses that may be compatible but because of their size, operating
characteristics, potential, off-site impacts and/or other similar reasons warrant a special review on a
case-by-case basis. The purpose of the conditional use permit review process is to determine if such a
use is appropriate at the proposed location and, if appropriate, to identify and additional conditions of
approval necessary to mitigate potential adverse impact and ensure compatibility between the
conditional use and other existing and allowed uses in the same zoning district and in the vicinity of the
subject property. The zoning district use tables identify which uses require a conditional use permit (see
Sections 13.06.100, - .200, - .300, and -.400). These uses may be authorized by the Director or Hearing
Examiner in accordance with the procedures established in TMC 13.05 and the applicable criteria
outlined below.

        Response: A conditional use permit is being requested to allow Franciscan Specialty Care, LLC to
        construct a level I Rehabilitation Hospital serving the Tacoma community at 815 South Vassault
        Street. The facility will provide rehabilitation services such as physical, occupational, and speech
        therapies to patients in the City of Tacoma. The hospital will not be associated with long term
        senior living or custodial care. Furthermore, this facility will not include an emergency room,
        surgical procedure rooms, or any trauma services.

        The scope of the project includes redevelopment of the property which will incorporate the
        demolition of all existing structures and features located on the subject parcel, and construction
        of a two story 60 bed Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospital on the property. Due to the site being
        rezoned, R-4, we have planned the project to comply with the zoning requirements in this
        district. The R-4 zoning allows construction of hospitals as a conditional use.


5.       Hospitals
D. Criteria. A conditional use permit shall be subject to the following criteria:

1. There shall be a demonstrated need for the use within the community at large which shall
   not be contrary to the public interest.
       Response: The State of Washington reviewed the Certificate of Need application
       submitted on behalf of Franciscan Specialty Care, LLC and approved the construction of
       a 60-bed dedicated level I Rehabilitation Hospital in Tacoma. The application proved the
       need for additional Inpatient Rehabilitation beds in the community to serve local


                                                                                                   LU16-0244 Exhibit A
                                                                                                 CUP Criteria Response

       residents in Tacoma. Building a Rehabilitation Hospital on this site will add to a network
       of centers planned for the city, enhances livability of surrounding residential
       neighborhoods, and vitality of nearby businesses. Another advantage of the site
       location is its proximity to two major corridors in the city, 6th Avenue and Pearl Street.
       The existing site includes a number of aging structures, some of which do not comply
       with current zoning restrictions. This project will remove the existing buildings, paved
       areas, and fencing that have been built on the current site. In addition to construction of
       a new building, the development of this project will save as many existing trees as
       possible on the property, and new landscaping will be installed to integrate the site with
       the adjacent properties. The adjusted property appraisal for this site after the
       redevelopment is complete will increase the tax value of the property and support better
       appraisal values for adjacent properties.
       The current zoning of the site allows for multiple family dwelling projects to be
       constructed. An Inpatient Hospital will have less impact on local traffic, noise potential,
       and nuisance in the surrounding neighborhoods than a multiple family development like
       an apartment complex or high density residential project. We feel that this building type
       will serve the community and neighborhood interests well on this site.

2. The use shall be consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive Plan, any adopted
   neighborhood or community plan, and applicable ordinances of the City of Tacoma.

       City of Tacoma: Design + Development Goals
       Goal DD – 1 Design new development to respond to and enhance the distinctive physical,
       historic, aesthetic, and cultural qualities of its location, while accommodating growth and
       change.
       Goal DD – 2 Ensure that parking area design and management balances the needs of all users,
       supports modal priorities, and is responsive to site context.
       Goal DD – 3 Ensure that sign location and design is responsive to site context and compatible
       with the envisioned mix of uses and modal properties.
       Goal DD – 4 Enhance human and environmental health in neighborhood design and
       development. Seek to protect safety and livability, support local access to healthy food, limit
       negative impacts on water and air quality, reduce carbon emissions, encourage active and

       Goal DD – 5 Ensure long-term resilience in the design of buildings, streets and open spaces,
       including the ability to adjust changing demographics, climate, and economy, and withstand and
       recover from natural disasters.
       Goal DD – 7 Support sustainable and resource efficient development and redevelopment.
       Goal DD – 8 Promote development practices that contribute to a sense of safety and reduction
       in opportunities for crime.
       Goal DD – 9 Support development patterns that result in compatible and graceful transitions
       between differing densities, intensities, and activities.

       The project has been planned and designed to be consistent with as many of the City of Tacoma
       Design and Development Goals as possible for this site and in association with the surrounding

        neighborhood. While not all of the Design and Development Goals listed in the City Plan are
        applicable to our project we designed the project to connect with the local neighborhood. The
        building design includes materials that are durable and will enhance the aesthetics of the
        building. The 2 story height and scale of the building, and exterior facade materials will
        complement the neighborhood’s existing and planned characteristics. The construction of the
        building will be built to withstand and function through environmental hazards, and the 24/7
        staffing of the facility will provide a safe environment in that part of the neighborhood.

3. For proposals that affect properties that are listed individually on the Tacoma Register of Historic
    Places, or are within preservation standards, and goals, objectives and guidelines or the historic or
    conservation districts. Proposed actions or alterations consistent with historic standards or
    guidelines as determined by the Landmarks Commission are a basis for denial.
        Response: This project does not directly affect buildings or properties within this
        standard.
4. The use shall be located, planned, and developed in such a manner that it is not inconsistent with the
    health, safety, convenience or general welfare or persons residing or working in the community.
    The following shall be considered in making a decision on conditional property use:
    a. The generation of noise, noxious or offensive emissions, light, glare, traffic, or other
        nuisances which may be injurious or to detriment of a significant portion of the
        community.
        Response:
             • Noise - Since the facility does not have an Emergency Department or Trauma
                 Center we do not anticipate ambulances using sirens with anymore frequency
                 than any other residential property in the area. During normal business activities
                 when there are patients requiring transportation, they are entering or leaving the
                 facility in non-life threatening situations where sirens are not required or used by
                 the transport services.
             • Noise The project includes an onsite emergency generator. The generator will
                 be located behind an enclosed block wall. In addition to a block wall enclosure
                 around the generator a critical grade muffler will be installed on the unit itself that
                 contains the noise during operation to 85 dBA or less from 10’ away. The
                 combination of the wall enclosure and the critical grade muffler combine to
                 significantly dampen the potential for any noise nuisance from the generator to
                 adjacent properties. Operation of the generator will occur only during Tacoma
                 Power outages and monthly testing required for healthcare facilities.
             • Noxious or Offensive Emissions – The generator fuel emissions are designed to
                 be EPA certified for stationary emergency applications. There are no other
                 known offensive emissions associated with the operation of the building other
                 than the generator.
             • Light – The lighting design for this project includes the use of full cutoff fixtures to
                 maintain dark sky compliance. The low profile will also reduce light in
                 comparison to other allowed uses in the R-4 zone.
             • Glare - Site lighting has been designed to prevent light trespass into adjacent
                 properties.
             • Traffic – Transportation Engineering Northwest (TENW) completed a
                 Transportation Impact Study for this project. TENW has provided additional
                 comments and responses which have been incorporated below. In addition to
                                                                                                LU16-0244 Exhibit A

                   10th/Vassault which is the primary access to the site), the proposed
                   Kindred project is estimated to result in a 0.7 to 4.3 percent increase in
                   vehicular traffic. This is not considered a significant impact and all off-site
                   study intersections are anticipated to operate at acceptable levels of
                   service with the proposed project.
                 Pedestrian facilities in the immediate project vicinity include sidewalks on
                   both sides of S Vassault Street between of S 10th Street and S 12th
                   Street and on both sides of S 10th Street between S Mildred Street and S
                   Vassault Street. The proposed project plans to improve the intersection of
                   S 10th Street/S Vassault Street for pedestrians and bicyclists by installing
                   directional curb ramps and also extending the existing sidewalk on the
                   east side of S Vassault Street along the property frontage.
                 Pierce Transit provides transit service in the vicinity of the proposed
                   Kindred site. Transit service for 6 different routes is provided with bus
                   stops at S 10th Street/S Mildred Street and S 12th Street/S Vassault
                   Street. These transit stops are located within 0.25 miles of the proposed
                   site.

   b. Availability of public services which may be necessary or desirable for the support of the
      use. These may include, but shall not be limited to, availability of utilities, transportation
      systems (including vehicular, pedestrian, and public transportation systems), education,
      police and fire facilities, and social and health services.
              Response: Public utilities are already in this area of the City and the developer
              will be paying the cost for the design and extension of water, power, and utility
              services associated with this project. The site is also close to major arterials and
              SR 16, allowing for convenient access to transportation. Transit stops are located
              nearby for public transportation, and there is an expansive sidewalk network for
              convenient pedestrian access.

   c. The adequacy of landscaping, screening, yard setbacks, open spaces, or other
      development characteristics necessary to mitigate the impact of the use upon
      neighboring properties.

                                                                                            LU16-0244 Exhibit A
                                                                                          CUP Criteria Response

             Response: The proposed site plan will increase the setbacks and as a result
             allow for improved landscape buffering to adjacent properties. The building is
             considerably smaller than the higher density multiple-family buildings that are
             allowed outright in the R-4 zone. All regular parking needs and patient activities
             will be met on site including an exterior therapy courtyard. The development will
             include upgraded sidewalks and pedestrian pathways on the property and at
             locations adjacent to the site. The site and landscaping design for this project
             will upgrade landscaping in the neighborhood, and the building itself will be
             orientated in relation to South Vassault in an effort to engage the neighborhood.

Sincerely.

                                    SEPA ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST
Purpose of checklist:
Governmental agencies use this checklist to help determine whether the environmental impacts of your
proposal are significant. This information is also helpful to determine if available avoidance, minimization
or compensatory mitigation measures will address the probable significant impacts or if an environmental
impact statement will be prepared to further analyze the proposal.

Instructions for applicants:
This environmental checklist asks you to describe some basic information about your proposal. Please
answer each question accurately and carefully, to the best of your knowledge. You may need to consult
with an agency specialist or private consultant for some questions. You may use “not applicable” or
"does not apply" only when you can explain why it does not apply and not when the answer is unknown.
You may also attach or incorporate by reference additional studies reports. Complete and accurate
answers to these questions often avoid delays with the SEPA process as well as later in the decision-
making process.

The checklist questions apply to all parts of your proposal, even if you plan to do them over a period of
time or on different parcels of land. Attach any additional information that will help describe your proposal
or its environmental effects. The agency to which you submit this checklist may ask you to explain your
answers or provide additional information reasonably related to determining if there may be significant
adverse impact.

Instructions for Lead Agencies:
Please adjust the format of this template as needed. Additional information may be necessary to
evaluate the existing environment, all interrelated aspects of the proposal and an analysis of adverse
impacts. The checklist is considered the first but not necessarily the only source of information needed to
make an adequate threshold determination. Once a threshold determination is made, the lead agency is
responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the checklist and other supporting documents.

Use of checklist for nonproject proposals: [help]
For nonproject proposals (such as ordinances, regulations, plans and programs), complete the applicable
parts of sections A and B plus the SUPPLEMENTAL SHEET FOR NONPROJECT ACTIONS (part D). Please
completely answer all questions that apply and note that the words "project," "applicant," and "property or
site" should be read as "proposal," "proponent," and "affected geographic area," respectively. The lead
agency may exclude (for non-projects) questions in Part B - Environmental Elements –that do not
contribute meaningfully to the analysis of the proposal.

    Approximately 20,000 cubic yards of cut and approximately 15,000 cubic yards or 2 feet deep of
    structural fill material will be used to prepare the site for building construction. The onsite soils
    appear suitable for reuse as structural fill if placed at a optimum moisture content. I fonsite soild are
    found to be unsuitable, the source of fill material is unknown at this time but will be from an
    approved source.
f. Could erosion occur as a result of clearing, construction, or use? If so, generally describe.
   [help]
   Yes, The sandy and silty soils are moderately susceptible to erosion by flowing water.
  Erosion could occur as a result of construction activities, but efforts will be made to limit and prevent
erosion.
g. About what percent of the site will be covered with impervious surfaces after project
  construction (for example, asphalt or buildings)? [help]
    Approximately 60 percent of the site will be impervious surface upon completion of the proposed
    development. Under existing conditions approximately 55 percent of the site is currently
    impervious surface.
h. Proposed measures to reduce or control erosion, or other impacts to the earth, if any: [help]
A temporary erosion and sedimentation control plan will be designed per City of Tacoma standards and
implemented for the duration of construction activities to reduce and control erosion impacts to the
site. Silt fences will be constructed along the downslope side of all areas planned for clearing and
grading. Preparation for site grading and construction will begin with procedures to control surface
water runoff.

    Based on the methodologies outlined in ITE Trip Generation (9th Edition) and the ITE Trip Generation Handbook
    (3rd Edition), the project is estimated to generate 776 weekday daily trips (388 entering, 388 exiting). Peak
    hour volumes are expected to occur between 4 and 6 PM. The percentage of the volume that would be trucks
    is not known. However, the project would generate minimal truck traffic.



g. Will the proposal interfere with, affect or be affected by the movement of agricultural and
   forest products on roads or streets in the area? If so, generally describe. [help]
Not to my knowledge

h. Proposed measures to reduce or control transportation impacts, if any: [help]
All parking will be provided on site. Because of the use of the project being a specialty hospital, traffic
will most likely occur at off peak times and no measures to reduce traffic impacts are planned.

15. Public Services [help]
a. Would the project result in an increased need for public services (for example: fire protection,
   police protection, public transit, health care, schools, other)? If so, generally describe. [help]
I do not believe the project will require increased need for public services.

b. Proposed measures to reduce or control direct impacts on public services, if any. [help]
I do not believe the project will require increased need for public services.

16. Utilities [help]
a. Circle utilities currently available at the site: [help]
   electricity, natural gas, water, refuse service, telephone, sanitary sewer, septic system,
   other ___________
        Power:               City of Tacoma
        Natural Gas:         Puget Sound Energy
        Water:               City of Tacoma
        Sanitary Sewer:      City of Tacoma

        Cable:               Comcast or CLICK
        Refuse Service:      City of Tacoma

     d. Describe the utilities that are proposed for the project, the utility providing the service,
           and the general construction activities on the site or in the immediate vicinity which might
           be needed. [help]
All utilities listed above will be used once the project is complete. Power, water and phone will be used
during construction for general construction needs.

2.0 PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF SERVICES

Terracon’s Supplemental Tacoma Smelter Plume Assessment was undertaken in an attempt to
delineate near-surface impacted soil identified in Terracon’s Preliminary Smelter Plume
Assessment performed in July 2016. The purpose of the Preliminary assessment was to identify
potential impacts to soil associated with particulate emissions originating from the plume emitted
by the former off-site ASARCO smelter. According to the Washington State Department of
Ecology’s (Ecology’s) Tacoma Smelter Plume map, reported arsenic concentrations in shallow
soil in the project vicinity range from 40.1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), which exceed
the Washington State Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) Method A cleanup level of 20 mg/kg.

In July 2016 Terracon performed shallow soil sampling for chemical analysis. Site soils were
investigated during the assessment in accordance with Ecology guidance. The results of the
sampling conducted at the site indicate that low levels of arsenic and lead, although below
applicable cleanup levels in most cases, exist throughout the site. Soils with arsenic
concentrations exceeding the MTCA Method A cleanup level were documented in shallow soils
to 1 foot below the ground surface (bgs) at four locations in the eastern (SS-11) and southern
(SS-3, SS-23, and SS-32) portions of the site. The samples collected from SS-23 contained
concentrations of arsenic at 48.5 and 65.2 mg/kg, which exceed the elevated arsenic level of 40
mg/kg as defined in Ecology’s Tacoma Smelter Plume Model Remedies Guidance.
