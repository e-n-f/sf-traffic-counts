SUBJECT:         OVENELL PARK MULTIMODAL ACCESS EVALUATION

Dear Deborah:

A transportation evaluation was requested by the City of Stanwood to assess future access to the Ovenell
Park property adjacent to SR 532. A range of access alternatives were considered at the outset and three
concepts were developed for further analysis. The analysis considered the influence of the park access on
intersection operations in the vicinity of the site. The findings show that a roundabout located at a new park
access would enhance safety while maintaining mobility on SR 532 and access to nearby properties.


Preferred Concept
The Ovenell park property is located in the City of
Stanwood’s Urban Growth Area (UGA) on the
western edge of the city, south of SR 532 and
generally between Advanced Heated Storage and the
Camano Gateway Bridge. A single-lane roundabout is
the preferred access concept because it provides
several benefits, including 1) intersection operations
that meet City standards, 2) proven safety records,
and 3) opportunities to introduce access management
at other access points on the highway.
                                                               Park property extents in the City’s Urban Growth Area
    1. The City and Washington State Department
       of Transportation (WSDOT) maintain standards for intersection operations to ensure efficient
       movement of people and goods. A roundabout located at the park access would meet both standards
       upon opening and forecast year 2035, which is consistent with the City’s Transportation Plan (City of
       Stanwood, 2015).

    2. Roundabouts naturally slow vehicle speeds as traffic merges and circulates through the intersection.
       When located on higher speed roadways, roundabouts can also be designed to slow traffic and serve
       as a gateway treatment into a City or urban area. Roundabout intersections also have fewer conflict
       points as compared to signalized and stop sign-controlled intersections.

    3. Access management techniques can enhance traffic safety while maintaining accessibility of adjacent
       properties. A roundabout allows for U-turns as an alternative to left-turns out of minor streets and
       driveways. This allows for the conversion of business driveways to right-in, right-out or three-quarter
       driveways that also allow inbound left-turns.

                                                                                                    November 10, 2015
                                                                                                          Page 2 of 11




These are the primary reasons a roundabout is recommended as the preferred concept for a new access
point to the Ovenell Park property. The report that follows describes our assumptions and approach,
evaluation criteria, and detailed results for three concepts which includes the preferred concept.


Assumptions and Approach
The analysis of three access concepts selected for evaluation began with a broad review of alternatives that
included a new access on SR 532 and shared driveways with adjacent land uses. The future park is
anticipated to be a regional attraction for City and County residents to participate in activities and utilize the
open space, waterfront and trail amenities. The approximate 20-acre park is much larger than other City parks
and given the regional draw, it is anticipated to serve residents from a broader area.


Alternatives removed from further consideration
A new access driveway to the park was considered aligning
with the existing stop sign-controlled intersection at SR 532 /
270th Street NW (Lovers Road). This alternative was
determined to be infeasible due to several reasons,
including:
      Intersection operations would not meet City
         standards;
      Limited intersection sight distance; and
      Steep grade required to meet bridge approach.                     From SR 532 looking west towards the future park

Similar alternatives were explored that considered new access points on the southern side of SR 532 aligning
with new access points to properties on the north, such as the Orchard Nursery. These other alternatives
were either revised to be included in the concepts for further review, or removed altogether due to geometric
constraints and/or impacts to driveway relocations.


Traffic volumes
Future traffic volumes were developed based on three primary sources: existing traffic counts collected on
SR 532, trips anticipated to be generated by the future park, and forecast volumes from the City’s travel
demand model that was developed for the Transportation Plan.

Traffic counts. Recent tube counts on SR 532 show the evening commute period experiences the highest
traffic volumes during a typical weekday1. Turning movement counts were collected at the SR 532 / 104th
Drive NW intersection and two nearby driveways during the PM peak hour (4 to 6 p.m.) on October 7, 2015.
Attachment A contains a copy of both the tube count data and turning movement counts.

Trip generation and distribution. Parks of all types typically generate the most trips on weekends, and
these trips may be concentrated over a short period of time due to events beginning or ending at specific
times that have large attendance levels. A weekend trip generation rate was selected to represent a

                                                                                                                    November 10, 2015
                                                                                                                          Page 3 of 11




reasonable worst-case scenario. This ensures that if the access operates acceptably during this higher
volume time period, the access will operate at that level or better during other time periods2.

Forecast volumes. The City developed a travel demand model for the year 2035 as part of the long-range
planning effort for the Transportation Plan. The access analysis is consistent with that model and used
forecast volumes to ensure the concepts have a long-range service life. Growth in the forecast model
volumes was applied to existing volumes to arrive at forecast 2035 traffic volumes at the park access.


Intersection operations and standards
Signalized and stop sign-controlled intersection operations were evaluated based on the level of service
(LOS) methodology identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM, 2010) and evaluated using Synchro
software. Roundabout intersection operations were evaluated with SIDRA software with standard WSDOT
protocols. LOS is measured in average control delay per vehicle and is typically reported using the
intersection delay. Attachment B contains the HCM LOS definitions.

Traffic operations for an intersection are described alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A
through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and long
vehicle delays. The City of Stanwood has an LOS standard of D or better for all intersections, except for stop
sign-controlled intersections which have a standard of LOS E or better. WSDOT’s standard is LOS D or better
for SR 532.


Evaluation Criteria
Concepts were evaluated based on whether it is a desirable (●), acceptable (◒), or an undesirable (○) option
for each criterion. The following criteria were used to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each
concept:

         Traffic operations measure how well the park access and nearby intersections process vehicles and
          allow turning movements without excessive delays.
         Safety identifies how well each concept addresses common safety considerations, such as the type
          of traffic control, sight distance, and separation of travel modes.
         Non-motorized mobility assesses to what extent pedestrian and bicycle connections are enhanced
          and the quality of facilities that are provided.
         Right-of-way impacts include the additional right-of-way required based on the footprint of each
          concept.
         Cost estimates are planning-level estimates of the cost of the transportation improvements
          identified.

           The park is anticipated to generate 86 peak hour vehicle trips with one-half inbound and one-half outbound (43 in / 43 out)
based on the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers). The majority of the trips will be oriented to/from
the City of Stanwood and it was assumed that approximately 85 percent of park trips would travel to/from the east, while the remaining
15 percent would travel to/from the west based on select zone analysis from the City’s travel demand model.

Access Concepts
Three concepts were selected from a range of access alternatives. The three concepts varied in access
location and the type of intersection traffic control required to maintain City standards for intersection
operations. For concepts that include a new access to accommodate park traffic, the best location was
determined to be at the eastern edge of the Ovenell Park property. This allows for maximum sight distance
from the Camano Gateway Island Bridge and preserves as much continuous park property for recreational
activities. Attachment C provides the lane configurations, traffic volumes, and LOS results for each concept
while detailed cost estimates for each concept is included in Attachment D.

The following pages present the results of the transportation evaluation for the following three concepts:

       Concept A extends the existing two-way left turn-lane (TWLTL) on SR 532 to the west and provides
        a stop sign-controlled intersection at the park access.
       Concept B extends the TWLTL on SR 532 to the west and provides a single-lane roundabout
        intersection at the park access.
       Concept C provides a traffic signal at the SR 532 / 104th Drive NW intersection and upgrades
        Saratoga Drive to provide access to the park.

Advantages of Concept C include:                          Non-Motorized Mobility

    Traffic operations results for the SR 532 / 104th    Pedestrian crossings            ●
       Drive NW signal are forecast to operate at LOS
       D in 2035, which is within the City standards.

Disadvantages of Concept C include:
     Preliminary layouts show the concept would
                                                          ● – Desirable
       require additional right-of-way along Saratoga     ◒ – Acceptable
       Drive.                                             ○ – Undesirable
     The estimated cost of this concept is the
       highest cost option of the three concepts
       evaluated at approximately $2.4 million.
     Driveways for nearby properties maintain
       turning movements at driveways with limited
       options for implementing access management
       on SR 532.
     Saratoga Drive as the primary access to the
       park property could be confusing for park users
       as the adjacent properties are industrial land
       uses.
     Traffic signals do not have the same history of
       safety improvements that roundabouts have
       shown.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                   intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                   determined solely by control delay.

Estimate of Probable Costs

Description of Work:
Widening of approximately 930 feet of SR 532, from west of 270th St NW to just west of 104th Dr NW. Roadway is a 3-lane typical section
with a two way left turn lane and a new sidewalk on the south side of SR 532. This concept also includes a new roadway connection to the
south for the park.


                Assumptions:
             1. This project has not been designed and is being estimated off of a conceptual sketch for planning purposes.
             2. This concept does not include any utility work that may be required.
             3. This concept includes widening of pavement to new three-lane section and grinding and overlaying existing pavement within
                project limits.
             4. The pavement design used for this concept is the minimum required by the City of Stanwood. Geotechnical investigation of
                existing soils and pavement design by a licensed engineer would be required to determine if this is adequate for specific
                conditions at the site.
             5. The cost of right-of-way or any associated fees is not included in this concept.

Estimate of Probable Costs

Description of Work:
SR 532 remains generally the same, with channelization and signalization improvements at the 104th Dr NW intersection. Roadway
reconstruction will be performed to the south along 104th Dr NW and west along Saratoga Dr to provide a route to the City's new park.

                  Assumptions:
             1. This project has not been designed and is being estimated off of a conceptual sketch for planning purposes.
             2. This concept does not include any utility work that may be required.
             3. The concept includes all new construction pavement through the commercial/industrial area to route to the City's new park.
                It includes one new traffic signal and right-of-way impacts.
             4. The pavement design used for this concept is the minimum required by the City of Stanwood. Geotechnical investigation of
                existing soils and pavement design by a licensed engineer would be required to determine if this is adequate for specific
                conditions at the site.
