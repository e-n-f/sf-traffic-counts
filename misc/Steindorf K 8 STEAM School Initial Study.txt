SECTION 1.0              INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

1.1              PURPOSE OF THE INITIAL STUDY

The Cambrian School District, as the Lead Agency, has prepared this Initial Study for the Steindorf
K-8 STEAM School project in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
the CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations §15000 et. seq.) and the regulations and
policies of the Cambrian School District.

The project proposes to reopen the Frank L. Steindorf, Jr. Elementary School, located at the southern
corner of Foxworthy Avenue and Ross Avenue in San Jose, as a K-8 Science, Technology,
Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) School. This Initial Study evaluates the environmental
impacts that might reasonably be anticipated to result from implementation of the proposed project.

1.1.1            Public Review Period

Publication of this Initial Study marks the beginning of a 30-day public review and comment period.
During this period, the Initial Study will be available to local, state, and federal agencies and to
interested organizations and individuals for review. Written comments concerning the environmental
review contained in this Initial Study during the 30-day public review period should be sent to:

1.1.2            Consideration of the Initial Study and Project

Following the conclusion of the public review period, the Cambrian School District will consider the
adoption of the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the project at a regularly
scheduled meeting. The District shall consider the Initial Study/MND together with any comments
received during the public review process. Upon adoption of the MND, the District may proceed
with project approval actions.

1.1.3            Notice of Determination

If the project is approved, the District will file a Notice of Determination (NOD), which will be
available for public inspection and posted within 24 hours of receipt at the County Clerk’s Office for
30 days. The filing of the NOD starts a 30-day statute of limitations on court challenges to the
approval under CEQA (CEQA Guidelines Section 15075(g)).

SECTION 3.0              PROJECT DESCRIPTION

3.1              PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

The Cambrian School District proposes to reopen the Frank L. Steindorf, Jr. Elementary School,
located at the southern corner of Foxworthy Avenue and Ross Avenue in San Jose, as a K-8 Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) School. The reopened school would have an
enrollment of up to 490 students. The school operated as a public school from 1956 through 1975.
The school facilities are currently leased to private tenants and are utilized for a variety of uses,
including a private preschool and K-6 elementary school, a church, and various educational
programs. The baseball diamond on the eastern portion of the site is used by the Cambrian Little
League.

To prepare the school for reopening as a public school for the 2016-17 school year, the District
proposes to implement several improvements on the site. A list and detailed description of the
project components are provided below. The location of the proposed improvements are shown on
the conceptual site plan for the project (refer to Figure 3.1-1).

         Approximately 10,000 square feet of new instructional and administrative buildings;
         Interior and exterior remodeling of approximately 24,000 square feet of existing classrooms
          and ancillary buildings;
         Reconfiguration of existing parking areas and drive aisles;
         Construction of a new amphitheater; and
         New landscaping and turf area.

3.1.2            New Instructional and Administrative Buildings

The existing classrooms on the school site are housed in four parallel structures. The northernmost
structure houses the school’s kindergarten facilities, while the three structures to the south each
contain five classrooms. The project proposes to construct a one-classroom addition, consisting of
888 square feet, to the west side of the existing southernmost structure. This new classroom would
match the 18-foot height of the existing building. The project also proposes to construct a new 7,029
square-foot structure, referred to as “Wing F”, to the south of and parallel to the existing classroom
buildings in an area currently used for parking. The new structure would house three laboratories
and a library/media center, with a height of 28 feet. Additionally, the project would construct a 2,266
square-foot Administrative Building to the east of the existing classroom structures, with a height of
28 feet.

3.1.3            Remodeling of Existing Buildings

The existing buildings on the site, which include the kindergarten and classroom structures described
above, as well as a large structure that houses the kitchen facilities and cafeteria/multi-use space,
would be remodeled as part of the project. The square footage of all existing structures to be
remodeled totals roughly 24,000 square feet. Remodeling activities would be limited to mainly
interior renovations. Exterior renovations would consist of replacing windows, exterior building
materials, and roofing.

3.1.4            Reconfiguration of Existing Parking Areas and Drive Aisles

The project would eliminate two existing semicircular driveways and would construct two new
driveways on Ross Avenue. A pick-up and drop-off area would be located in the reconfigured
parking area. Vehicles transporting students would enter the site via the northern driveway and
proceed south before exiting via the southern driveway.

A new eight-space staff parking area would be located on the northeast corner of the site. A parking
area consisting of 20 spaces would be located adjacent to Ross Avenue and the pick-up and drop-off
area. As described above, a new classroom building would be constructed on the southern portion of
the site in the location of an existing parking area. To accommodate for this loss of parking, a new
paved parking area consisting of 78 spaces would be installed to the south of the new classroom
building in a vacant asphalt area currently used to provide vehicle access to the southern portion of
the site.

3.1.5            Amphitheater

A new outdoor amphitheater facility would be constructed in the southeast portion of the site,
adjacent to the existing cafeteria/multi-use building. The amphitheater would be capable of seating
the full student body (up to 490 students) and associated staff, and would be used for assembly and
outdoor teaching activities.

3.1.6            New Landscaping and Turf Area

New landscaping would be installed throughout the eastern portion of the site where the school
facilities are located. A total of 32 new trees would be planted on the campus. Most of the trees
would be planted near the school structures, with additional trees planted adjacent to and within the
new parking areas. Up to 20 existing trees would be removed to accommodate proposed
construction.

In compliance with the Regional Water Quality Control Board’s and the City of San Jose’s
stormwater requirements, the proposed project will construct and utilize multiple on-site bioretention
basins (refer to Figure 3.1-4). The bioretention basins will be sized using the combination method
provided in the Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program. The proposed
bioretention basins will be sized to treat the amount of runoff generated by the impervious surfaces
created and/or replaced by the project.

The project also proposes to install a new recreational grass turf area adjacent to the existing baseball
diamonds on the western portion of the site. A new quarter-mile walking track would be located
around the perimeter of the largest baseball diamond and the turf area. A blacktop sports and
recreation area would be located between the large baseball diamond and the classroom buildings.
No changes to the use of the baseball diamonds are proposed.

                           IMPACTS

This section describes the existing environmental conditions on and near the project area, as well as
environmental impacts associated with the proposed project. The environmental checklist, as
recommended in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, identifies
environmental impacts that could occur if the proposed project is implemented.

The right-hand column in the checklist lists the source(s) for the answer to each question. The
sources cited are identified at the end of this section. Mitigation measures are identified for all
significant project impacts. “Mitigation Measures” are measures that will minimize, avoid, or
eliminate a significant impact (CEQA Guidelines §15370). Measures that are proposed by the
applicant that will further reduce or avoid already less than significant impacts are categorized as
“Avoidance Measures.”

4.1              AESTHETICS

4.1.1            Setting

The Steindorf School site is located within a fully developed residential and commercial area in San
Jose. One and two-story single family homes are located to the north, east and west of the site and a
retail shopping center is located to the south. The project area is flat and is not visible from adjoining
areas of the City, nor are outlying areas visible from the site. The site is not visible from a scenic
highway corridor, nor would it be more visible than surrounding development as part of the scenic
vista from the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. The site is currently developed with single story
school buildings with peaked roofs. Mature trees along the perimeter of the site and adjacent to the
existing school buildings are the most visually prominent features of the project site.

4.1.2.1          Aesthetic Impacts

As shown in Figure 3.1-1, the project would construct a new wing, referred to as “Wing F”, south of
the existing southernmost wing of classrooms on the site. The new wing would be approximately 28
feet in height. A new administration building would be constructed to the west of the existing
classroom buildings at the east (front) side of the school. The new administration building would
also be approximately 28 feet in height. The existing classroom wings, multiuse building and
kindergarten rooms would be refurbished, including replacement of windows, exterior building
materials and roofing. The project would remove 20 trees on the site and plant 32 new trees. The
project would not modify the baseball fields on the west side of the project site.

Construction of the new educational wing and administrative building and the refurbishment of the
existing classroom wings would not adversely impact views of the site. Upon completion of the
project, the Steindorf School would appear as a newly constructed school due to the new building
materials and the addition of the new educational wing and administrative building. New lighting for
the building and grounds would be energy efficient lighting that would include shielding to prevent
light spill over and glare. The campus would have a similar scale as under pre-project conditions and
would not result in new sources of light or glare that would adversely affect adjacent residential and
commercial land uses.

The removal of 20 mature trees on the site would have the greatest visual impact on views of the site.
However, most of the trees to be removed are located in the interior of the site, and 59 existing
mature trees located throughout the site and around the site’s perimeter would remain. With the
addition of 32 new trees proposed by the project, the removal of trees would not result in a
significant aesthetics impact.

4.1.3            Conclusion

The proposed project would not result in significant adverse visual or aesthetic impacts. (Less Than
Significant Impact)

4.3              AIR QUALITY

The following discussion is based upon an air quality analysis prepared by Illingworth & Rodkin, Inc.
in January 2015. This report is included as Appendix A of this Initial Study.

4.3.1            Setting

Air quality and the amount of a given pollutant in the atmosphere are determined by the amount of
the pollutant released and the atmosphere’s ability to transport and dilute the pollutant. The major
determinants of transport and dilution are wind, atmospheric stability, terrain, and for photochemical
pollutants, sunshine.

The Bay Area typically has moderate ventilation, frequent inversions that restrict vertical dilution,
and terrain that restricts horizontal dilution. These factors give the Bay Area a relatively high
atmospheric potential for pollution.

                                   Existing Emissions from the Site

The existing school facilities on the site are currently leased to private tenants and are utilized for a
variety of uses, including a private preschool and K-6 elementary school, a church, and various
educational programs. The baseball diamond on the eastern portion of the site is used by the
Cambrian Little League. Emissions of air pollutants associated with these uses are primarily related
to automobiles traveling to and from the site.

4.3.1.1          Regulatory Setting

                              National Ambient Air Quality Standards

As required by the Clean Air Act, National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been
established for six major air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), ozone (O3),
particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur oxides, and lead. Pursuant to the California Clean Air
Act, the state has also established the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), which are
generally more stringent than the corresponding federal standards. The Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD) is primarily responsible for assuring that the national and state
ambient air quality standards are attained and maintained in the San Francisco Bay Air Basin.

Santa Clara County, and the Bay Area as a whole, is classified as a nonattainment area for ozone,
PM10, and PM2.5 under federal law. The county is either in attainment or unclassified for other
pollutants.

Ozone, often called photochemical smog, is classified as a secondary air pollutant, meaning it is not
emitted directly into the air. It is created by the action of sunlight on ozone precursors, primarily
reactive hydrocarbons and NOX. The major sources of ozone precursors include combustion sources
such as factories and automobiles and evaporation of solvents and fuels. The main public health
concerns associated with ground level ozone pollution are eye irritation and impairment of
respiratory functions.



Steindorf K-8 STEAM School                                                                      Initial Study
Cambrian School District                            17                                          March 2015
PM10 consists of solid and liquid particles of dust, soot, aerosols, and other matter which are less than
10 microns in diameter. Major sources of PM10 are combustion (including automobile engines –
particularly diesel, fires, and factories) and dust from paved and unpaved roads. Public health
concerns associated with PM10 include aggravation of chronic disease and heart/lung disease
symptoms.

PM2.5, also known as Fine Particulate Matter, consists of the same type of matter as PM10, but is less
than 2.5 microns in diameter. The major source of PM2.5 is combustion, but the particles can also be
formed by chemical changes occurring in the air. PM2.5 can cause respiratory problems and is of
particular concern because the particles can penetrate deeper into the lungs.

The region is required to adopt clean air plans on a triennial basis that show progress towards
meeting the state ozone standard. The latest regional plan was adopted in September 2010. This
plan includes a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions from stationary, area, and mobile sources
through the expeditious implementation of all feasible measures, including transportation control
measures (TCMs) and programs such as “Spare the Air.”1

                                           Toxic Air Contaminants

Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) are a broad class of compounds known to cause morbidity or
mortality (usually because they cause cancer or serious illness) and include, but are not limited to,
criteria air pollutants. TACs are found in ambient air, especially in urban areas, and are caused by
industry, agriculture, fuel combustion, and commercial operations (e.g., dry cleaners). TACs are
typically found in low concentrations, even near their source (e.g., diesel particulate matter near a
highway). Because chronic exposure can result in adverse health effects, TACs are regulated at the
regional, state, and federal level. The identification, regulation, and monitoring of TACs is relatively
new compared to that for criteria air pollutants that have established ambient air quality standards.
TACs are regulated or evaluated on the basis of risk to human health rather than comparison to an
ambient air quality standard or emission-based threshold.

Diesel Particulate Matter

Diesel exhaust, in the form of diesel particulate matter (DPM), is the predominant TAC in urban air
with the potential to cause cancer. It is estimated to represent about two-thirds of the cancer risk
from TACs (based on the statewide average). According to the California Air Resource Board
(CARB), diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of gases, vapors, and fine particles. This complexity
makes the evaluation of health effects of diesel exhaust a complex scientific issue. Some of the
chemicals in diesel exhaust, such as benzene and formaldehyde, have been previously identified as
TACs by the CARB, and are listed as carcinogens either under the State's Proposition 65 or under the
federal Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. California has adopted a comprehensive diesel risk
reduction program. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the CARB have adopted
low-sulfur diesel fuel standards in 2006 that reduces diesel particulate matter substantially. The
CARB recently adopted new regulations requiring the retrofit and/or replacement of construction
equipment, on-highway diesel trucks, and diesel buses in order to lower fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) emissions and reduce statewide cancer risk from diesel exhaust.

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)

Particulate matter in excess of state and federal standards represents another challenge for the Bay
Area. Elevated concentrations of PM2.5 are the result of both region-wide (or cumulative) emissions
and localized emissions. High particulate matter levels aggravate respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases, reduce lung function, increase mortality (e.g., lung cancer), and result in reduced lung
function growth in children.

                                             Sensitive Receptors

BAAQMD defines sensitive receptors as facilities or land uses where members of the public that are
particularly sensitive to the effects of air pollutants, such as children, the elderly, and the chronically
ill, are likely to be located. These facilities include residences, hospitals, school playgrounds, child-
care centers, retirement homes, and convalescent homes. Other than the project site itself, the nearest
sensitive receptors are the residences located on Foxworthy Avenue, Ross Avenue, and Leigh
Avenue.

4.3.2.1          CEQA Thresholds

As discussed in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064(b), the determination of whether a project may
have a significant effect on the environment calls for careful judgment on the part of the lead agency
and must be based to the extent possible on scientific and factual data. The Cambrian School
District, and other jurisdictions in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, often utilize the thresholds
and methodology for assessing air emissions and/or health effects adopted by the BAAQMD based
upon the scientific and other factual data prepared by BAAQMD in developing those thresholds.

Thresholds prepared and adopted by BAAQMD in May 2011 were the subject of a lawsuit by the
California Building Industry Association (BIA)2 and a subsequent appeal by BAAQMD.3 The
Appellate Court decision on August 13, 2013 upheld the thresholds as valid. The Appellate Court’s
decision was subsequently appealed to the California Supreme Court, which granted limited review
and before whom the matter is still pending as of early March 2015.

The determination of whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment is subject to
the discretion of each lead agency, based upon substantial evidence. The issues in the California
Building Industry Association v. BAAQMD lawsuit are not relevant to the scientific basis of
BAAQMD’s analysis of what levels of pollutants should be deemed significant. The Cambrian
School District has determined that the scientific information in BAAQMD’s proposed thresholds of
significance analysis provides substantial evidence to support the 2011 thresholds and, therefore, has
determined the thresholds and methodologies from BAAQMD’s May 2011 CEQA Air Quality
Guidelines are appropriate for use in this analysis to determine whether there would be any project
operational impacts in terms of criteria pollutants, toxic air contaminants and odors. Evidence
supporting these thresholds has been presented in the following documents:

The analysis in the Initial Study is based upon the general methodologies in the most recent
BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (dated May 2012) and numeric thresholds identified for
the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin in the May 2011 BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines, as
shown in Table 4.3-1.

4.3.2.2          Clean Air Plan Consistency

The most recent clean air plan is the Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan that was adopted by BAAQMD
in September 2010. The proposed project would not conflict with the latest Clean Air planning
efforts since (1) the project would have emissions below the BAAQMD thresholds (see Section
4.3.2.4 below), (2) the proposed project would not require a General Plan amendment, and (3)
development would be near existing transit with regional connections. Net emissions from the
project would not exceed any of the significance thresholds and, thus, it is not required to incorporate
project-specific transportation control measures listed in the latest Clean Air Plan.

The project, which efficiently utilizes an existing elementary school campus in an urban, easily
accessible part of San Jose, would support the primary goals of the 2010 CAP and it would not
disrupt or hinder implementation of any 2010 CAP control measures. The project will not hinder the
implementation of the CAP control measures and will not conflict with or obstruct implementation of

the 2010 CAP. The project by itself, therefore, will not result in a significant impact related to
consistency with the Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan.

4.3.2.3          Construction Air Quality Impacts

                                          Criteria Pollutants

BAAQMD has established screening criteria for the sizes of land use projects that could result in
significant air pollutant emissions. For construction impacts, the screening size for elementary
schools is identified at 3,904 students. Because the proposed project is well below the screening
level established by BAAQMD, construction period emissions of criteria pollutants would be less
than significant.

                                       Toxic Air Contaminants

Construction activity for the proposed project is anticipated to involve demolition of the existing
pavement, as well as grading, building construction, and paving activities. Construction equipment
and associated heavy-duty truck traffic generate diesel exhaust, which is a known TAC. Diesel
exhaust poses both a health and nuisance impact to nearby receptors. A health risk assessment of the
project construction activities was conducted that evaluated potential health effects of sensitive
receptors from construction emissions of diesel particulate matter DPM.4 A dispersion model was
used to predict the off-site DPM concentrations resulting from project construction at sensitive
receptors so that lifetime cancer risks could be predicted. The closest off-site sensitive receptors are
residences adjacent to the western and southern project site boundaries.

Construction Emissions

The refined health risk assessment focused on modeling on-site construction activity. Construction
period emissions were modeled using project-specific information. The CalEEMod model provided
total annual PM2.5 exhaust emissions (assumed to be diesel particulate matter) for the off-road
construction equipment and for exhaust emissions from on-road vehicles (haul trucks, vendor trucks,
and worker vehicles), with total emissions of 0.0182 tons (36 pounds). Fugitive PM2.5 dust emissions
were calculated by CalEEMod as 1.5 pounds for the construction period.

Dispersion Modeling

The U.S. EPA AERMOD dispersion model was used to predict concentrations of DPM and PM2.5 at
existing sensitive receptors (residences) in the area surrounding the project construction area. The
AERMOD dispersion model is a BAAQMD-recommended model for use in modeling analysis of
these types of emission activities for CEQA projects.5 The AERMOD modeling utilized two area
sources to represent the on-site construction emissions, one for DPM exhaust emissions and the other
for fugitive PM2.5 dust emissions. Emissions from vehicle travel around the project site were
included in the modeled area sources.

Predicted Cancer Risk and Hazards

The maximum modeled DPM and PM2.5 concentrations occurred at a residence adjacent to the
southern project site boundary. The location of this receptor is identified in Appendix A. Increased
cancer risks were calculated using the modeled DPM concentrations and BAAQMD recommended
risk assessment methods for both a child exposure and adult exposure.6 The cancer risk calculations
were based on applying the BAAQMD recommended age sensitivity factors to the DPM exposures.
Age-sensitivity factors reflect the greater sensitivity of infants and small children to cancer causing
TACs. BAAQMD recommended exposure parameters were used for the cancer risk calculations.7
Infant and child exposures were assumed to occur at all residences during the entire construction
period.

The results of this assessment indicate that for project construction the incremental residential child
cancer risk at the maximally exposed individual (MEI) receptor would be 2.2 in one million and the
incremental residential adult cancer risk would be 0.1 in one million. These increased cancer risks
would be lower than the BAAQMD significance threshold of a cancer risk of 10 in one million or
greater and would be considered a less than significant impact.

The maximum modeled annual PM2.5 concentration was 0.03 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3)
occurring at the same location where the maximum cancer risk would occur. This PM2.5
concentration is lower than the BAAQMD significance threshold of 0.3 μg/m3 used to judge the
significance of health impacts from PM2.5. This would be considered a less than significant impact.

Potential non-cancer health effects due to chronic exposure to DPM were also evaluated. Non-cancer
health hazards from TAC exposure are expressed in terms of a hazard index (HI), which is the ratio
of the TAC concentration to a reference exposure level (REL). California’s Office of Environmental
Health and Hazards (OEHHA) has defined acceptable concentration levels for contaminants that
pose non-cancer health hazards. TAC concentrations below the REL are not expected to cause
adverse health impacts, even for sensitive individuals. The chronic inhalation REL for DPM is five
μg/m3. The maximum modeled annual residential DPM concentration was 0.025 μg/m 3, which is
much lower than the REL. The maximum computed hazard index based on this DPM concentration
is 0.005 which is much lower than the BAAQMD significance criterion of a hazard index greater
than 1.0. This would be considered a less than significant impact.

                                                  Dust

During demolition, grading, and construction activities, dust would be generated. Most of the dust
would result during grading activities. The amount of dust generated would be highly variable and is
dependent on the size of the area disturbed at any given time, amount of activity, soil conditions and
meteorological conditions. Typical winds during late spring through summer are from the northwest.
Nearby land uses could be adversely affected by dust generated during construction activities. The
BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines consider these impacts to be less than significant if best
management practices are employed to reduce these emissions. The standard dust control measures

listed below would be implemented by the proposed project, resulting in a less than significant
impact related to construction dust.

Standard Measures:

Implementation of the measures recommended by BAAQMD and listed below would reduce the air
quality and fugitive dust-related impacts associated with grading and new construction to a less than
significant. The contractor shall implement the following Best Management Practices that are
required of all projects:

          1. All exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas, staging areas, soil piles, graded areas, and
             unpaved access roads) shall be watered two times per day.

          2. All haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material off-site shall be covered.

          3. All visible mud or dirt track-out onto adjacent public roads shall be removed using wet
             power vacuum street sweepers at least once per day. The use of dry power sweeping is
             prohibited.

          4. All vehicle speeds on unpaved roads shall be limited to 15 mph.

          5. All roadways, driveways, and sidewalks to be paved shall be completed as soon as
             possible and feasible. Building pads shall be laid as soon as possible and feasible, as well,
             after grading unless seeding or soil binders are used.

          6. Idling times shall be minimized either by shutting equipment off when not in use or
             reducing the maximum idling time to 5 minutes (as required by the California airborne
             toxics control measure Title 13, Section 2485 of California Code of Regulations [CCR]).
             Clear signage shall be provided for construction workers at all access points.

          7. All construction equipment shall be maintained and properly tuned in accordance with
             manufacturer’s specifications. All equipment shall be checked by a certified mechanic
             and determined to be running in proper condition prior to operation.

          8. Post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact at the Lead
             Agency regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond and take corrective action
             within 48 hours. The Air District’s phone number shall also be visible to ensure
             compliance with applicable regulations.

4.3.2.4           Operational Air Quality Impacts

Emissions of air pollutants associated with operation of the proposed project would result primarily
from automobiles traveling to and from the site. As discussed previously, BAAQMD has established
screening criteria for the sizes of land use projects that could result in significant air pollutant
emissions. For operational impacts, the screening size for elementary schools is identified at 2,747
students. Because the proposed project is well below the screening level established by BAAQMD


Steindorf K-8 STEAM School                                                                       Initial Study

and the baseline condition for the site is an existing campus actively use by other tenants, operational
emissions of criteria pollutants would be less than significant.

4.3.2.4          Odor Impacts

The project would generate localized emissions of diesel exhaust during construction equipment
operation and truck activity. These emissions may be noticeable from time to time by adjacent
receptors. However, they would be localized and are not likely to adversely affect people off site by
resulting in confirmed odor complaints. The project would not include any sources of significant
odors that would cause complaints from surrounding uses. This would be a less than significant
impact.

4.3.3            Conclusion

With implementation of the standard measures described above, the proposed project would not
result in significant air quality impacts. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.4              BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The following discussion is based, in part, upon a tree survey completed by Deborah Ellis,
Consulting Arborist and Horticulturalist completed in July 2014. This report is included as
Appendix B of this Initial Study.

4.4.1            Existing Setting

The project site is located within an urbanized area of the City of San Jose. The campus is comprised
of buildings, pavement, turf fields, and landscaping. There are no waterways, wetlands, or other
sensitive habitat located on or adjacent to the site. Ross Creek is the nearest waterway to the site and
is located approximately 1.1 miles to the south. Habitats in developed areas are extremely low in
species diversity. Species using developed habitat are predominately urban adapted birds and
animals, such as doves, squirrels, and domestic cats.

Rare, threatened, endangered and sensitive plants, animals and natural communities are not expected
or likely to occur on the project site, based upon the fact that the site does not contain suitable habitat
for any of these species (e.g., marsh, wetland, riparian or serpentine soils).

4.4.1.1          Trees

A tree survey completed on the site identified a total of 79 trees, including one native coast live oak.
The tree survey, including a detailed description of the size, health, and preservation suitability of
each tree surveyed is included as Appendix B of this Initial Study.

4.4.1.2          Habitat Conservation Plans

The Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) was adopted by participating agencies in
January 2013. Although the site is located within the study area of the HCP, the Cambrian School
District is not a participating agency, and the project would not be subject to the provisions of the

4.4.2.1          Tree Removal and Replacement

A total of 79 trees are located on the site. The proposed project would result in the removal of 20 on-
site trees, including one native coast live oak tree. To replace the removed trees, the project would
plant a total of 32 new trees on the site. The majority of the new trees would be located on the
eastern portion of the site adjacent to school buildings and parking areas. Figures 3.1-5 and 3.1-6
show the locations of the proposed trees. Because the Cambrian School District does not have any
ordinances aimed specifically at protecting biological resources, including trees, the removal of trees
on the site would not conflict with any applicable local policies or ordinances. The District is not
subject to the City of San Jose tree removal controls.

                                              Tree Protection

Construction of the proposed project could result in adverse effects to trees designated for
preservation. Demolition, site grading, and operation of heavy construction equipment could damage
tree roots and crowns both directly through mechanical injury and indirectly through soil
compaction. Given the disturbed nature of the project site and minimal anticipated disturbance to

Cambrian School District                              27                                                     March 2015
trees on or adjacent to the site, the proposed project would not result in a significant impact to
existing trees. The avoidance measures listed below are included in the proposed project to protect
the existing trees to remain on the site. (Less than Significant Impact)

Avoidance Measures: The proposed project will implement the following tree protection measures
to reduce and avoid construction-related impacts to trees:

         Protect, prune, irrigate and maintain all existing trees and other vegetation not designated for
          removal,
         Prior to any demolition work, the contractor shall protect all existing plant material not
          scheduled for removal by installing temporary four to six foot high “blaze orange”
          construction safety fencing at the tree driplines or the perimeter of the tree groupings. The
          fencing shall be secured with driven metal stakes,
         Prior to driving stakes, structural roots would be located by hand probing to avoid damaging
          roots with stakes,
         Fence will be maintained until project is complete,
         Signs will be posted on fence indicating that the protective fencing and area within shall not
          be disturbed,
         Written authorization from the District shall be required for any work within the protected
          fence area, and
         Any trenching or grading within the protected fence area shall be done by hand to avoid root
          damage.

4.4.2.2           Special-Status Species

The project site is located in an urban area and is completely developed with existing buildings,
paved surface parking, baseball fields, and ornamental landscaping. No sensitive habitats or habitats
suitable for special-status plants or wildlife species occur within or adjacent to the project site. The
project would not directly result in impacts to special-status species.

The trees on and adjacent to the project site could provide nesting habitat for birds, including
migratory birds and raptors. Nesting birds are among the species protected under provisions of the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and California Fish and Game Code Sections 3503, 3503.5, and 2800.
Construction disturbance during the breeding season could result in the incidental loss of fertile eggs
or nestlings, or otherwise lead to nest abandonment. Disturbance that causes abandonment and/or
loss of reproductive effort is considered a taking by the CDFW. Any loss of fertile eggs, nesting
raptors, or any activities resulting in nest abandonment would constitute an impact. Construction
activities such as tree removal and site grading that disturb a nesting bird or raptor on-site or
immediately adjacent to the construction zone would also constitute an impact.

Impact BIO-1:         Construction of the proposed project could disturb or destroy active raptor or
                      migratory bird nests and/or result in the destruction of individual birds.
                      (Significant Impact)

Mitigation Measures:

MM BIO-1.1:           In conformance with the California State Fish and Game Code and the provisions
                      of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the project includes the following measures to

                     avoid and/or reduce impacts to nesting birds (if present on or adjacent to the site)
                     to a less than significant level:

                            Pre-construction nesting bird surveys shall be completed prior to tree
                             removal if removal if construction is proposed to commence during the
                             breeding season (February 1 to August 31) in order to avoid impacts to
                             nesting birds. Surveys shall be completed by a qualified biologist no
                             more than 14 days before construction begins. During this survey, the
                             biologist or ornithologist shall inspect all trees and other possible nesting
                             habitats in and immediately adjacent to the construction areas for nests.

                            If an active nest is found in an area that will be disturbed by construction,
                             the ornithologist shall designate an adequate buffer zone to be established
                             around the nest, in consultation with the California Department of Fish
                             and Wildlife (CDFW). The buffer would ensure that nests shall not be
                             disturbed during project construction.

                            A report summarizing the results of the pre-construction survey and
                             subsequent efforts to protect nesting raptors and/or migratory birds (if
                             found to be present) shall be submitted to the Cambrian School District
                             Superintendent.

4.4.2.3          Other Biological Resources

The project site and surrounding area are completely developed with urban uses. The project site
does not include riparian habitat, wetlands or any other sensitive habitat, nor is the site adjacent to
wetlands, waterways or other sensitive habitat. No sensitive plant or animal species are known or
expected to inhabit the site. The project site is not a migratory corridor and does not contain wildlife
nursery sites.

The site is not subject to the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, including the
nitrogen deposition fee intended to mitigate cumulative impacts to Bay Checkerspot Butterfly
habitat. As discussed in Section 4.16 Transportation, students attending the proposed K-8 STEAM
School would be drawn from other schools in the Cambrian School District. Thus, the vehicle trips
associated with the proposed project already exist in Santa Clara Valley, and would merely be
redistributed in the local roadway system. Although travel distances may increase slightly compared
to existing conditions, the project’s contribution towards cumulative nitrogen deposition impacts on
Bay Checkerspot Butterfly habitat is considered less than significant.

4.4.3            Conclusion

With implementation of the mitigation and avoidance measures described above, the proposed
project would not result in significant impacts to biological resources. (Less Than Significant
Impact with Mitigation)

4.5                CULTURAL RESOURCES

4.5.1              Setting

The Steindorf School site is located within a fully developed residential and commercial area in San
Jose. Development of the school and surround neighborhood dates to the 1950’s and 1960’s. There
are no historic buildings, sites or known historic features in the vicinity of the project. The project
site is not located in an area identified as archeologically sensitive on the City of San Jose’s Areas of
Archeological Sensitivity maps, nor is the project site in a location that would be expected to contain
sensitive archeological resources (e.g. near a body of water).

Potentially sensitive areas for the presence of paleontological resources are based on the underlying
geologic formation. The project area is situated on Holocene age alluvial deposits, which are
underlain by Pleistocene age sediments at unknown depths. Holocene age soil is generally not
considered sensitive for paleontological resources, because biological remains younger than 10,000
years are not usually considered fossils. Remains of a mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) were,
however, recently found along the Guadalupe River in San Jose within a geologic strata mapped as
Holocene, indicating that Holocene materials in the Santa Clara Valley may have some level of
sensitivity for paleontological resources.8

4.5.2.1            Historic and Archaeological Resources

The project area is completely developed, and the soils on the site were previously disturbed during
the original construction of the school campus. There are no historic buildings located on or adjacent
to the campus that would be affected by the proposed project. Although the site is not located in an
archaeologically sensitive area, there is a potential to encounter subsurface cultural resource

materials during construction. Should any archaeological resource or human remains be found
during grading operations, their disturbance could be considered a significant impact. The project
includes the standard measures listed below to avoid significant impacts to archaeological resources
and/or human remains.

Standard Measures: The proposed project would implement the following standard measures to
reduce and avoid disturbance to archaeological resources and/or human remains:

         In the event any unanticipated prehistoric or significant historic era cultural materials are
          exposed during construction, all grading and/or excavation operations within 50 feet of the
          find shall be halted, the Superintendent of the Cambrian School District shall be notified, and
          a qualified professional archaeologist shall examine the find and make appropriate
          recommendations regarding the significance of the find and the appropriate mitigation. The
          recommendation shall be implemented and could include collection, recordation, and analysis
          of any significant cultural materials.

         In the event that human remains are found, all project-related construction shall cease within
          a 50-foot radius of the find in order to proceed with the testing and mitigation measures
          required. Pursuant to Section 7050.5 of the Health and Safety Code and Section 5097.94 of
          the Public Resources Code of the State of California:

                        In the event of the discovery of human remains during construction, there
                         shall be no further excavation or disturbance of the site or any nearby area
                         reasonably suspected to overlie adjacent remains. The Santa Clara County
                         Coroner shall be notified and shall make a determination as to whether the
                         remains are Native American. If the Coroner determines that the remains are
                         not subject to his authority, he shall notify the Native American Heritage
                         Commission who shall attempt to identify descendants of the deceased Native
                         American. If no satisfactory agreement can be reached as to the disposition
                         of the remains pursuant to this State law, then the landowner shall re-inter the
                         human remains and items associated with Native American burials on the
                         property in a location not subject to further subsurface disturbance.

         If cultural resources or remains are discovered during any construction associated with the
          project, a final report shall be submitted to the Superintendent of the Cambrian School
          District. This report shall contain a description of the mitigation program that was
          implemented and its results, including a description of the monitoring and testing program, a
          list of the resources found, a summary of the resources analysis methodology and conclusion,
          and a description of the disposition/curation of the resources. The report shall verify
          completion of the mitigation program to the satisfaction of the Superintendent.

4.5.2.2          Paleontological Impacts

The proposed project has a low potential to impact undiscovered paleontological resources, based on
the age and type of surface soils. It is possible, however, that deeper soils may contain older

Pleistocene sediments, which have a higher sensitivity for paleontological materials. Activities that
involve substantial excavation would have a higher potential for encountering paleontological
deposits. The project does not propose substantial excavation. Nevertheless, construction activities
may result in the accidental destruction or disturbance of paleontological sites. The project includes
the standard measures listed below to avoid significant impacts to paleontological resources.

Standard Measures: The proposed project would implement the following standard measures to
reduce and avoid disturbance to paleontological resources:

       If paleontological resources are discovered during construction, all work on the site will stop
        immediately until a qualified professional paleontologist can assess the nature and
        importance of the find and recommend appropriate treatment. Treatment may include
        preparation and recovery of fossil materials so that they can be housed in an appropriate
        museum or university collection and may also include preparation of a report for publication
        describing the finds. The Cambrian School District Superintendent will be responsible for
        ensuring that the recommendations of the paleontological monitor regarding treatment and
        reporting are implemented.

4.5.3            Conclusion

With implementation of the standard measure described above, the proposed project would not result
in significant impacts to cultural resources. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.6              GEOLOGY AND SOILS

The following discussion is based upon Geotechnical and Geohazard Investigation completed for the
proposed project by Cleary Consultants, Inc. in August 2014. The report is included as Appendix C.

4.6.1            Existing Setting

4.6.1.1          Topography

There are no unique geologic features on or adjacent to the project site. Due to the flat topography of
the project area, the potential for erosion or landslide on or adjacent to the site is low.

4.6.1.2          Expansive Soils

Based upon soil borings completed on the site, the near surface soils are considered to have a low to
moderate expansion potential.

4.6.1.3          Seismicity

The project area is located within the seismically active San Francisco Bay Area, which is classified
as Zone 4, the most seismically active zone in the United States. The San Andreas, Hayward, and
Calaveras faults are significant regional active faults that could produce earthquakes affecting the
proposed project during its anticipated life span. No known faults cross the project site, and the site
is not within an Alquist-Priolo earthquake fault zone. The San Andreas fault is approximately 7.6
miles southwest of the site, the Hayward fault is approximately 12.3 miles northeast of the site, and
the Calaveras fault is approximately 12.3 miles east of the site.

4.6.1.4          Liquefaction

Liquefaction is the result of seismic activity and is characterized as the transformation of loose,
water-saturated soils from a solid state to a liquid state after ground shaking. There are many
variables that contribute to liquefaction, including the age of the soil, soil type, soil cohesion, soil
density, and ground water level. Based upon the subsurface conditions on the site, the potential for
liquefaction to occur is considered very low.

4.6.1.5          Seismically Induced Settlement

The soils identified in borings taken on the site were analyzed for seismically-induced settlement.
The calculated total earthquake-induced dry soil settlement for these layers is approximately two
inches at the site vicinity with approximately one inch of differential settlement over a distance of 50
feet. Based on the above information, the analysis concluded that the potential for new structures on
the site to be affected by seismically induced settlement is low.

4.6.2.1           Geology and Soils Impacts

The proposed project consists of improvements to an existing school campus, including construction
of new structures and renovation of existing buildings.

The project site is flat; therefore, the potential for erosion and landslides is low. Soils on the site are
considered to have a low to moderate potential for expansion. The potential for liquefaction on the
site is considered very low. No known faults cross the project site and the site is not within an
Alquist-Priolo earthquake fault zone; therefore, the possibility of fault rupture on the site is low.

The project would be exposed to earthquakes during its anticipated lifespan. Ground shaking during
an earthquake could directly damage the proposed buildings or result in differential settlement, which
could also damage the buildings. The buildings and improvements proposed by the project would be
designed and constructed in conformance with the California Building Code, which would avoid and
minimize potential damage from seismic shaking and seismic-related hazards. The standard
measures listed below would be implemented by the proposed project to avoid exposing people or
structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury, or death as a result
of geology, soil, and seismic conditions on the project site.

Standard Measures: The proposed project would implement the following measures to reduce and
avoid impacts related to geology, soil and seismic conditions, including differential settlement:

       The specific design features identified in the geotechnical investigation completed for the
        proposed project will be incorporated into the project design. The design-level geotechnical
        investigation will be submitted to the California Division of the State Architect (DSA) for
        review and approval.

       The project shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the California Building
        Code, which contains the regulations that govern the construction of structures in California.
        Adherence to the California Building Code will ensure the proposed improvements resist
        minor earthquakes without damage and major earthquakes without collapse.

       The design-level drawings and all accompanying documentation will be subject to the DSA
        review and approval process.

As stated above, the proposed project would be subject to the DSA review and approval process.
The primary role of the DSA is to ensure that California's K-12 schools and community colleges are
seismically safe and accessible to all. The DSA fulfills this role by reviewing construction project
plans for structural safety, fire and life safety, and accessibility.

4.6.3            Conclusion

With implementation of the standard measures described above, the proposed project would not
result in significant geologic or seismic impacts. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.7              GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

4.7.1            Setting

Global climate change is the alteration of the Earth’s weather including its temperature, precipitation,
and wind patterns. The world’s leading climate scientists have reached consensus that global climate
change is underway and is very likely caused by humans.9 Humans generate greenhouse gases
(GHG) through the combustion of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) for energy production and
transportation, decomposition of solid waste, burning of wood, deforestation, agricultural practices,
and industrial activities.

4.7.1.1          State Regulations

Regulatory efforts in California that apply to the project are summarized below.

                              State of California Executive Order S-3-05

In June 2005, the Governor of California signed Executive Order S-3-05, which identified Cal/EPA
as the lead coordinating State agency for establishing climate change emission reduction targets in
California. A “Climate Action Team”, a multi-agency group was set up to implement Executive
Order S-3-05. Under this order, the state plans to reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990
levels by 2050.

          Assembly Bill (AB) 32 – The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006

California Assembly Bill (AB 32) was signed into law in the fall of 2006. The bill requires
achievement by 2020 of a statewide GHG emissions limit equivalent to 1990 emissions, and the
adoption of rules and regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective
GHG emissions reductions.

                     Senate Bill 97 – Modification to the Public Resources Code

On August 24, 2007, Governor Schwarzenegger signed SB 97. SB 97 requires the Office of
Planning and Research (OPR) to prepare, develop, and transmit guidelines to the Resources Agency
for the mitigation of GHG emissions or the effects of GHG emissions, including, but not limited to
the effects associated with transportation or energy consumption. The Resources Agency adopted
the CEQA Guidelines Amendments addressing greenhouse gas emissions on December 30, 2009.

              Senate Bill 375 – Redesigning Communities to Reduce Greenhouse Gases

Senate Bill 375 (SB 375), known as the Sustainable Communities Strategy and Climate Protection
Act, was signed into law in September 2008. It builds on AB 32 by requiring CARB to develop
regional GHG reduction targets to be achieved from the automobile and light truck sectors for 2020
and 2035 in comparison to 2005 emissions. The per capita reduction targets for passenger vehicles in
the San Francisco Bay Area include a seven percent reduction by 2020 and a 15 percent reduction by
2035.10 The four major requirements of SB 375 are:

          1. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) must meet greenhouse gas emission
             reduction targets for automobiles and light trucks through land use and transportation
             strategies.
          2. MPOs must create a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), to provide an integrated
             land use/transportation plan for meeting regional targets, consistent with the Regional
             Transportation Plan (RTP).
          3. Regional housing elements and transportation plans must be synchronized on eight-year
             schedules, with Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) allocation numbers
             conforming to the SCS.
          4. MPOs must use transportation and air emissions modeling techniques consistent with
             guidelines prepared by the California Transportation Commission (CTC).

MTC and ABAG adopted Plan Bay Area in July 2013. The strategies in the plan are intended to
promote compact, mixed-use development close to public transit, jobs, schools, shopping, parks,
recreation, and other amenities, particularly within Priority Development Areas (PDAs) identified by
local jurisdictions. The project site is located within a PDA.

                                         BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) CEQA Guidelines (May 2011) include
thresholds for analyzing air quality impacts, including thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions. The
BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines also outline a methodology for estimating greenhouse gases.

4.7.1.2           Greenhouse Gas Emissions

As described previously, the school facilities on the project site are currently leased to private tenants
and are utilized for a variety of uses, including a private preschool and K-6 elementary school, a
church, and various educational programs. The baseball diamond on the eastern portion of the site is
used by the Cambrian Little League.

Under existing conditions, GHG emissions associated with the project site result from the
combustion of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) for energy production. The energy is used in
various ways, directly and indirectly, ranging from the electricity used to run the campus heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning system to the fuel used to transport people to and from the campus.


10
   The emission reduction targets are for those associated with land use and transportation strategies, only. Emission
reductions due to the California Low Carbon Fuel Standards or Pavley emission control standards are not included
in the targets.

 Would the project:
 1. Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either                                                                   1,6,7

    significant impact on the environment?
 2. Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or                                                                 1,6,7
    regulation adopted for the purpose of
    reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases?


4.7.2.1          Thresholds of Significance

As discussed in the air quality section of this Initial Study (4.3.3.1 Thresholds of Significance), the
determination of whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment is made by the
lead agency, based upon substantial evidence. The District considers the BAAQMD thresholds to be
based on the best information available for the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin and supported by
substantial evidence. Scientific information supporting the thresholds was documented in
BAAQMD’s proposed thresholds of significance analysis. 11 Accordingly, this Initial Study uses the
thresholds and methodologies from BAAQMD’s May 2011 CEQA Air Quality Guidelines to
determine the potential air quality and greenhouse gas emissions impacts of the proposed project.

4.7.2.2          Greenhouse Gas Emissions

                                        Operational Emissions

The greenhouse gas emissions associated with project operation would mostly result from the
incremental increase in energy used to power the new school facilities, and the fuel used to transport
up to 490 students and associated staff to and from school.

The BAAQMD screening level for elementary school related operational greenhouse gas emissions
is 44,000 square feet. The screening level for junior high schools is 46,000 square feet. Projects
smaller than the screening level are assumed by BAAQMD to result in less than significant
greenhouse gas emissions. To be conservative, this analysis uses the lower screening level for
elementary schools, even though the proposed school would be K-8.

The proposed project would renovate the existing 24,000 square feet of educational and ancillary
structures on the site, and construct an additional 10,000 square feet of classroom and administrative
space. The combined total of existing and proposed buildings would be 34,000 square feet, which is
below the BAAQMD screening levels.

Additionally, the existing school facilities on the project site are currently leased to private tenants
and are utilized for a variety of uses on a regular basis. These uses are an existing source of
emissions that would be replaced by the project. As a result, the net increase in emissions from the
project would be even lower than the conservative total used above in the comparison to BAAQMD
screening levels.

For these reasons, the proposed project is determined to result in a less than significant greenhouse
gas emissions impact.
                                      Construction Emissions

The proposed improvements to the site would result in minor increases in GHG emissions associated
with construction activities including operation of construction equipment and emissions from
construction workers’ personal vehicles traveling to and from the construction site. Construction-
related GHG emissions vary depending on the level of activity, length of the construction period,
specific construction operations, types of equipment, and number of personnel. Neither the District
nor BAAQMD has established a quantitative threshold or standard for determining whether a
project's construction-related GHG emissions are significant. Because project construction would be
a temporary condition (a total of 12 months) and would not result in a permanent increase in
emissions that would interfere with the implementation of AB 32, the increase in emissions would be
less than significant.

4.7.3            Conclusion

Given the overwhelming scope of global climate change, it is not anticipated that the proposed
project would have an individually discernible effect on global climate change (i.e., that any increase
in global temperature or rise in sea level could be attributed to the emissions resulting from the
project). Rather, it is more appropriate to conclude that the GHG emissions generated by the
proposed project would combine with emissions across the state, nation, and globe to cumulatively
contribute to global climate change.

The size of the proposed project is below the BAAQMD screening level for elementary school
related operational greenhouse gas emissions; therefore, the project would not generate a substantial
volume of greenhouse gases. For these reasons, the project would not substantially impede local,
regional or statewide efforts to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels and would not
make a cumulatively considerable contribution to global climate change associated with greenhouse
gas emissions. (Less Than Significant Impact)

4.8              HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

The following discussion is based, in part, upon a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment completed
by B2 Environmental LLC in July 2014 and a Preliminary Environmental Assessment completed by
Cornerstone Earth Group in February 2015. The reports are included as Appendix D and Appendix
E, respectively.

4.8.1            Setting

The project is proposed at the existing Steindorf Elementary School campus. The project site is
listed on the HAZNET database, which is a list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the
Government Code (Cortese List). The listing is for disposal of asbestos-containing waste in 1994
and 1996, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and material containing PCBs in 1996, and small
quantities of laboratory waste chemicals and inorganic solid waste in 1997. These reported disposals
are not indicative of a significant environmental concern with the site. There are no recorded sources
of soil or groundwater contamination in the immediate vicinity that would affect the project.

The project site is not located within an airport land use plan or in the vicinity of a private airstrip,
nor is it near wildlands or areas otherwise subject to wildland fires. There are no adopted emergency
response plans or emergency evacuation plans applicable to the project site.

4.8.1.1          Soils

Prior to the development of the school campus in the 1950’s, the project site was used for agricultural
production. Historic agricultural activities on the site likely included use of pesticides, fertilizers,
and other agricultural chemicals. Although most agricultural chemicals in use today have a short
persistence, some agricultural chemicals used in the past may remain in soil and pose a health risk to
persons who come into direct contact with the soil.

Additionally, there is the potential for naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) to be present in soils on
the site. NOA most frequently occurs in and immediately adjacent to areas of Ultramafic (igneous
and metamorphic rocks with high iron and magnesium concentrations) rock outcrops. According to
the California Department of Conservation General Location Guide for Ultramafic Rocks in
California, Ultramafic outcrops are located within 10 miles of the site. Based on this information,
there is a significant likelihood of encountering NOA beneath the site.

For these reasons, soil samples were collected from the project site and sent to a laboratory to be
tested for organochlorine pesticides and associated heavy metals, as well as NOA. The results of the
soil sampling are summarized below.

Organochlorine Pesticides. Laboratory analyses of the soil samples revealed organochlorine
pesticide concentrations that exceed environmental screening criteria in two of 23 soil samples (near
the location of a former residence on the site and near the existing Wing C building). Results of
nearby soil samples indicate the extent of impact at these two locations is likely limited.

NOA. NOA-regulated minerals Actinolite or Chrysotile were detected in seven of 13 soil samples
with five of seven samples containing concentrations that exceeded the California Department of
Toxic Substance Control’s (DTSC) screening criteria of 0.01 percent. Hornblende, a non-regulated
NOA mineral, was also detected in nine of 13 samples at concentrations ranging from 0.0012 to 0.16
percent. Although Hornblende is a non-regulated NOA mineral, DTSC has determined that it should
be included in the mitigation actions for this project (see section 4.8.2.2 below).

Lead. Lead was detected in 30 of 30 near surface soil samples, with three of the soil samples
containing lead concentrations that exceeded the residential screening level of 80 mg/kg. Sampling
for lead occurred adjacent to existing buildings, and the most likely source for the lead that was
detected is the depositing of lead-based paint from those buildings in nearby soils. Because the
calculated 95 percent upper confidence limit (UCL) for lead is 49 mg/kg on the site, site-wide lead
concentrations are considered to be within the range of acceptable levels and do not pose a health
risk.

Arsenic. Arsenic was detected in 10 of 10 soil samples that were analyzed at concentrations up to 10
mg/kg. The calculated 95 percent UCL for arsenic on the site is 7 mg/kg. Natural background
concentrations of arsenic are often well above its health-based regional screening level (RSL) of 0.67
mg/kg. Statistical evaluation was used to estimate a potential background arsenic concentration in
the project area. Based on the statistical evaluation, 12 mg/kg appears to be an appropriate upper-
bound background concentration for arsenic in the project area. Levels of arsenic found on the site,
therefore, are not considered to be above natural background concentrations, and do not pose a health
risk.

4.8.1.2          Building Materials

The existing school campus was constructed in the 1950’s. As a result, asbestos containing materials
(ACMs), lead-based paint, and fluorescent light ballasts containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
may be present. Asbestos was commonly used in building materials until 1981 and the use of lead in
paint and PCBs in ballasts was not regulated until 1978.

4.8.2.2          Soils

As described above, soil sampling completed on the site detected organochlorine pesticides, NOA,
lead, and arsenic. While the levels of lead and arsenic detected on the site were found to be below
levels requiring remediation, the levels of organochlorine pesticides and NOA were above
established thresholds.

Impact HAZ-1:             Soils on the site contain elevated levels of organochlorine pesticides and
                          NOA. (Significant Impact)

Mitigation Measures:

The following mitigation measures would reduce potential impacts associated with exposure to
contaminated soil to a less than significant level:


Steindorf K-8 STEAM School                                                                                     Initial Study
Cambrian School District                                42                                                     March 2015
MM HAZ-1.1:          Site Management Plan: Prior to ground disturbance, a Site Management Plan
                     (SMP) will be completed for the project. The SMP will include measures for the
                     remediation and/or mitigation of soil contaminated by organochlorine pesticides
                     and naturally occurring asbestos, and will be implemented prior to and during site
                     grading activities. It is anticipated that the SMP will include the following
                     remediation and/or mitigation actions:

                            Excavation and off-haul of soils containing elevated concentrations of
                             organochlorine pesticides. The volume of affected soil to be excavated
                             and removed from the site is estimated to range from approximately 10 to
                             100 cubic yards.

                            Installation of a cap on all exposed soils to minimize the potential release
                             of asbestos fibers in the future. Proposed buildings, asphalt, concrete, and
                             artificial turf would serve as an effective cap. In softscape areas, a
                             minimum of six inches of clean imported fill would serve as an effective
                             cap. The cap could also consist of landscaping mulch in areas not
                             intended for foot traffic.

                     The SMP will include requirements for annual inspections and reporting and
                     protocols to follow for any activity that might breach the cap and expose NOA
                     soils. The Cambrian School District would be responsible for implementing the
                     protocols presented in the SMP to protect against future releases and exposures to
                     NOA affected soils.

MM HAZ-1.2:          Waste Disposal Plans: The waste disposal plans to be incorporated into the SMP
                     would describe the procedures for transporting and disposing the organochlorine
                     affected soil generated during removal activities at the project site. The waste
                     disposal plan would include the following elements:

                        Stockpiling: It is anticipated that conventional construction equipment, such
                         as a front-end loader equipped with a backhoe or excavator, will be used to
                         excavate the soil. The soil will be stockpiled on the site in a location that will
                         provide sufficient truck access and maneuverability of loading equipment.
                         The soil stockpiles will be configured and covered to minimize the
                         uncontrolled migration of soil in the event of rain and to minimize the release
                         of dust in windy conditions.

                        Excavation and Disposal of Contaminated Soil: The volume of soil affected
                         by organochlorine pesticides that would likely be excavated and removed
                         from the site is estimated to range from 10 to 100 cubic yards. Samples of
                         the excavated soil to be off-hauled will be analyzed to determine the
                         appropriate disposal facility. Soil that contains hazardous waste will be
                         disposed at landfills licensed to receive such waste.

                        Confirmation Soil Sampling and Testing: Following excavation, confirmation
                         soil samples will be collected at the bottom and along the sidewalls of the
                         excavated areas. The samples will be analyzed to verify achievement of


Steindorf K-8 STEAM School                                                                       Initial Study
Cambrian School District                            43                                           March 2015
                           remediation goals. Additional excavation and verification sampling would be
                           performed if needed to achieve site remediation goals.

                          Soil Management: The maximum volume of soil that would be imported to
                           the site for the proposed cap purposes in landscape areas is estimated to be
                           630 cubic yards.12 The SMP will include procedures to ensure that fill and
                           cap materials are verified as clean in accordance with DTSC Guidance
                           (DTSC, 2001, Information Advisory, Clean Imported Fill Material). Samples
                           will be analyzed for potential constituents of concern at the site, in
                           accordance with DTSC guidelines.

                          Truck Route: Based on the maximum estimated volumes of excavated soil
                           and imported fill material, up to five truckloads could be required to haul
                           contaminated soil from the site and 63 truckloads to haul clean soil to the
                           site.13 This would be equivalent to 126 truck trips (one arriving to the site
                           and another departing). Approximately ten of the truck trips would occur
                           during the demolition phase, while the remainder would occur during the
                           construction phase. Prior to the initiation of site clean-up activities, truck
                           routes will be established for the proposed project. Construction-related
                           heavy truck traffic will be required to utilize main thoroughfares and would
                           be limited to daytime hours. This measure is intended to minimize noise and
                           traffic impacts to surrounding neighborhoods.

                          The SMP would include additional measures related to waste disposal and
                           soil management, such as staging and loading procedures and record keeping
                           requirements.

MM HAZ-1.3:           Health and Safety Plan: The Health and Safety Plan to be incorporated into the
                      SMP would describe the safety measures and procedures to be followed during
                      SMP implementation activities. The Health and Safety Plan would be prepared
                      by a certified industrial hygienist, in accordance with federal OSHA and
                      California DOSH regulations. The Health and Safety Plan would include the
                      following elements:

                          Training: Construction workers will receive hazardous materials training in
                           accordance with state and federal regulations.

                          Emergency Procedures: In the event unanticipated hazardous materials are
                           encountered during clean-up activities, the Cambrian School District will stop
                           work and take actions necessary to address the hazardous materials in
                           accordance with DTSC Guidance. In the event additional contamination is

12
   DTSC considers landscape areas, drainage swales, and narrow undeveloped land strips as “low activity” areas.
The finished cap surface in these areas would consist of grass, mulch, bark, topsoil and/or other landscaping
materials already proposed by the project. Due to the relatively low NOA concentrations, DTSC typically would not
require additional capping in “low activity” areas. “High activity” areas typically require a clean soil cap up to one
foot thick with an underlying visual marker fabric for demarcation purposes. The estimate of imported clean soil is
therefore based on the maximum required depth of 12 inches of imported soil and the approximate surface area to be
covered by “high activity” areas under the proposed project (34,000 square feet).
13
   This estimate assumes each truck would hold 10 cubic yards of material. Given that some trucks can hold up to
20 cubic yards per load, this is a conservative estimate.

                         encountered, subsequent actions would likely include evaluation (i.e., soil
                         sampling and lab testing) and removal if concentrations are found to exceed
                         regulatory standards.

                        Security Measures: Access to the work areas will be restricted to authorized
                         personnel only. The immediate work areas will be secured with temporary
                         chain-link fencing during non-work hours. During work hours, the Site
                         Safety Officer will screen all personnel entering the general work area.
                         Workers will be required to have available a respirator with the appropriate
                         filters.

                        Control Measures: Dust control measures will be implemented during
                         excavation activities, including but not limited to the BMPs listed in Section
                         4.7 Air Quality. For example, all vehicles may be required to maintain slow
                         speeds (i.e., less than 5 miles per hour) for safety purposes and for dust
                         control measures. All trucks will be hosed or brushed off prior to leaving the
                         site to prevent track out of contaminated soils and NOA from the sides and
                         tires.

                        Air Monitoring: Air monitoring for asbestos fibers will be conducted by the
                         Site Safety Officer in and surrounding the work zones during excavation and
                         soil-handling activities to monitor for potential emissions, in conformance
                         with BAAQMD guidelines. Air monitoring will also be conducted at the site
                         perimeter during ground disturbing activities.

                        Dust Monitoring: Real time monitoring of total dust (<10 µm diameter) will
                         be conducted throughout the duration of the project during activities that may
                         significantly disturb soil. The monitoring will be performed using three
                         DataRAM PDR-1000 particulate monitors. These meters log the detected
                         airborne dust concentrations.


4.8.2.2          Building Materials

As described in Section 3.0, Project Description, several existing campus buildings would be
modernized and/or retrofitted under the proposed project. Based on the construction date of existing
school buildings (i.e., 1950’s), asbestos containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint, and
fluorescent light ballasts containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may be present within the
existing structures. Construction workers, students, employees, visitors, the public, and/or the
environment could be exposed to these hazardous materials, if these materials are present and
standard measures are not implemented.

Standard Measures: The project includes the following standard measures to avoid impacts related
to ACMs, lead-based paint, and PCB containing ballasts:

         In conformance with state and local laws, a visual inspection/pre-construction survey, and
          possible sampling, shall be completed prior to renovating the buildings to determine the
          presence of ACMs, lead-based paint and/or PCB containing ballasts.

         All PCB containing ballasts shall be removed and disposed of in accordance with state and
          local laws.

         All potentially friable asbestos-containing materials shall be removed in accordance with
          National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) guidelines prior to
          building renovation that may disturb the materials.

         All renovation activities will be undertaken in accordance with Cal/OSHA standards,
          contained in Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Section 1529, to protect
          workers from exposure to asbestos. Materials containing more than one percent asbestos are
          also subject to Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) regulations.

         During renovation activities, all building materials containing lead-based paint shall be
          removed in accordance with Cal/OSHA Lead in Construction Standard, Title 8, California
          Code of Regulations 1532.1, including employees training, employee air monitoring and dust
          control. Any debris or soil containing lead-based paint or coatings will be disposed of at
          landfills that meet acceptance criteria for the waste being disposed.

4.8.2.2          Other Hazardous Materials Concerns

The proposed school would not use, transport, dispose, or emit hazardous materials. There are no
known hazardous material conditions near the middle school that pose a safety concern. The project
would not result in a safety hazard as a result of airport use or wildfires; nor would it interfere with
an emergency response or evacuation plan.

4.8.3            Conclusion

With implementation of the standard and mitigation measures described above, the project would not
result in significant hazards and hazardous materials impacts. (Less Than Significant Impact With
Mitigation)

4.9.1             Regulatory Setting

                               Discharge Elimination System Permit

The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Federal Clean Water Act require local
municipalities to implement measures to control construction and post-construction pollution
entering local storm drainage systems to the maximum extent practicable. To comply with the
requirements of the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Federal Clean Water Act, the
State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) implemented a National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit for Santa Clara County. Two programs, the Nonpoint Source
Management Program and the Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program
(SCVURPPP) have been implemented under the NPDES permit to control construction and post-
construction runoff.

                                Nonpoint Source Management Program

In 1988, the SWRCB adopted the Nonpoint Source Management Plan in an effort to control nonpoint
source pollution in California. In December 1999, the Plan was updated to comply with the
requirements of Section 319 of the Clean Water Act and Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act
Reauthorization Amendment of 1990. The Nonpoint Source Management Plan requires individual
permitees to control discharge associated with construction activities. The Nonpoint Source
Management Plan is administered by the RWQCB under the NPDES General Permit for
Construction Activities. A project must comply with the requirements of the Nonpoint Source
Program if the project:

     Disturbs one acre or more of soil; or
     Disturbs less than one acre of soil but is part of a larger development that, in total, disturbs one
      acre or more of soil.

The NPDES General Permit for Construction Activities requires the developer to submit a Notice of
Intent (NOI) to the RWQCB and to develop a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) to
control discharge associated with construction activities.

                   Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program

The SCVURPPP was developed by the RWQCB to assist local jurisdictions within Santa Clara
County implement the provisions of the NPDES permit. This program was also designed to fulfill
the requirements of Section 304(1) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which mandated that the
Environmental Protection Agency develop NPDES application requirements for storm water runoff.
The Program’s Municipal Regional NPDES storm water permit replaces the formerly separate
countywide municipal stormwater permits with one permit for all 76 Bay Area municipalities to
standardize requirements throughout the region. It specifies actions necessary to reduce the
