                                     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A. PROPONENT/PROJECT LOCATION

Proponent
The proposed Phase 3.2 building project is sponsored by City Investors XII LLC.

Project Location
The site of the proposed Phase 3.2 building development is located in Seattle's South Lake
Union neighborhood, on the southwest portion of the block that is bounded by Mercer Street
on the north, 8th Avenue N on the east, Republican Street on the south and Dexter Avenue N
on the west. The current proposal under SDCI Master Use Permit No. 3021696 is for the Phase
3.2 building which is to the west of the existing Phase 3.1 building.

B. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Overview of UW School of Medicine Lake Union Project

In 2010, MUP #3011312 was obtained for research and development buildings in Phases 3.1
and 3.2 on the western block. The construction of Phase 3.1 and the parking garage under the
Phase 3.1 building and Phase 3.2 site was completed in 2013. Since that time, changes have
been proposed to the Phase 3.2 building approved under MUP #3011312. This 2016 EIS
Addendum reflects the updated project description for the Phase 3.2 building. This 2016 EIS
Addendum does not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives
that are described in the South Lake Union EIS.

Relevant Environmental Analyses
The following is an overview of earlier environmental analysis that pertains to the Phase 3.2
building.

2005 EIS

In 2005, the South Lake Union Research & Administrative Office Space: Phase 2 and 3
Development EIS was issued.

The 2005 EIS included analysis of the following:

       •    Proposed Action – The Proposed Action was to redevelop a two-block area in South
            Lake Union for use by the University Washington School of Medicine (or other
            similar user). Development was to occur in approximately two phases, with each
            phase containing biomedical research laboratories and related administrative office
            space, below-grade parking and loading, together with landscaped plazas and
            courtyards.

UW Medicine: Lake Union Phase 3.2                      Section 2 – Comparison of Environment Impacts
2016 EIS Addendum                                  1
       •   East Block – Phase 2 was to involve redevelopment of the east block of the two-
           block site. Development was to include two 5-story buildings (housing research
           laboratory uses with associated administrative office uses) with approximately
           262,200 sq. ft. of above-grade development. A possible program/design option was
           also considered for a 2-level, approximately 20,000 sq. ft. data center for the
           University, which would be located below-grade. Four levels of below-grade parking
           were to be provided for approximately 500 vehicles, and approximately 24,000 sq.
           ft. of publicly-accessible open space was to be included in the development.
       •   West Block – The subsequent Phase 3 development was to involve redevelopment
           of the entire west block portion of the overall site. Development was anticipated to
           include three 5-story above-grade biomedical research laboratory uses with
           associated administrative office uses consisting of approximately 365,000 to 420,000
           sq. ft. of research laboratory space with associated office space. Below-grade
           parking was to be provided for approximately 500 to 800 vehicles.
       •   Alternatives – In addition to the Proposed Action, which was for laboratory
           development with some associated office use, the EIS evaluated three alternatives,
           including: Full Office Development Alternative; Full Laboratory Development
           Alternative; and No Action Alternative.
       •   Environmental Issues – The EIS evaluated the Proposed Action and each of the
           alternatives in light of the following environmental parameters:
           o    Land Use Patterns
           o    Aesthetics
           o    Historic/Cultural Resources
           o    Energy
           o    Transportation


2010 EIS Addendum

The 2010 EIS Addendum for Phases 3.2 and 3.3 of the South Lake Union Research Laboratory
and Office Space project relied on the 2005 EIS to evaluate proposed actions, alternatives, and
environment impacts. The 2010 EIS Addendum added analyses and information about the
proposal but did not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives in
the 2005 EIS. The environmental parameters evaluated in the 2010 EIS Addendum included:

       •   Land Use - land use patterns and the relationship of the Proposed Action to adopted
           City land use plans, policies, and regulations;
       •   Energy -- Greenhouse Gas Emissions;
       •   Aesthetics & Viewshed;
       •   Historic & Cultural Resources; and

2016 EIS Addendum                               2
       •   Transportation, Circulation and Parking.

No other significant adverse environmental impacts from the Proposed Action were
anticipated.

The 2005 EIS and the 2010 EIS Addendum are collectively referred to herein as the South Lake
Union UW EIS.

2016 EIS Addendum - Key Analyses
SEPA authorizes an agency to use environmental documents that have previously been
prepared in order to evaluate proposed actions, alternatives, or environmental impacts. The
proposals may be the same as, or different than, those analyzed in the existing documents.
Existing documents may be used by employing one or more designated methods. The method
most appropriate for the project proposed in SDCI MUP #3021696 is to use the existing South
Lake Union UW EIS and disclose additional information and analysis in this EIS Addendum. This
2016 EIS Addendum adds analyses or information about the Phase 3.2 building but does not
substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives in the South Lake Union
UW EIS.

In April 2016, SDCI reviewed a comparative analysis of the Phase 3.2 building as approved
under MUP #3011312 and the Phase 3.2 building as currently proposed. Based on that review,
SDCI determined that as SEPA compliance for the revised Phase 3.2 building, it is appropriate to
use the South Lake Union UW EIS and prepare this 2016 EIS Addendum to address the following
environmental parameter:

       •   Transportation, Circulation and Parking.

This parameter is analyzed in Section II of this EIS Addendum. No other significant adverse
environmental impacts from the changes to the proposed Phase 3.2 building are anticipated.
This 2016 EIS Addendum should be read in conjunction with the South Lake Union UW EIS.

C. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION
The Phase 3.2 building approved under MUP #3011312 included 156,671 square feet of
research and development lab use. The building program has subsequently been revised to
include 139,030 square feet of research and development lab use, along with 25,000 square
feet of medical services (medical clinic) use (total of 164,030 square feet). Figure 2 is a site plan
for Phase 3.2.

Pedestrian and Vehicular Access
      •   Pedestrian Access – Access would be provided via an entry on Dexter Avenue N.
          (northwest corner off the Phase 3.2 building) and an entry from the courtyard
          between the Phase 3.1 and Phase 3.2 buildings, as well as from the underground
          garage. During the hours when the medical clinic is closed, access to the building
          would be via key card.
      •   Vehicular Access – Access to the parking garage would occur via a single existing
          driveway located along the Republican Street frontage.

Parking and Loading
      •   Parking – Below-grade parking was built on the block beneath the Phases 3.1 and
          3.2 buildings as part of the Phase 3.1 development. The existing 233 parking spaces
          would be shared with the Phase 3.2 uses.

       •   Loading – Loading and service would be accommodated below-grade via the
           common vehicular access. Three loading spaces exist and would be shared between
           the existing Phase 3.1 development and the proposed Phase 3.2.



                                            SECTION 2

                              Comparison of Environment Impacts

The South Lake Union UW EIS contains environmental analyses for the UW Medicine: Lake
Union Phase 3 development. SDCI has determined that this 2016 EIS Addendum is appropriate
to provide updated environmental analysis and mitigation with respect to Transportation,
Circulation, and Parking for the current Phase 3.2 building proposal.

The analysis of transportation, circulation, and parking has been updated to reflect project-
specific information including trip generation, level of service at key intersections, safety, non-
motorized facilities, and parking. The analysis consists of a brief summary of impacts disclosed
in the South Lake Union UW EIS followed by an analysis of project-specific impacts associated
with the proposed Phase 3.2 building.

TRANSPORTATION, CIRCULATION AND PARKING

2005 EIS
The 2005 EIS noted that the entire Phase 3 development was anticipated to generate 3,120
daily trips, including 480 during the AM peak hour and 445 during the PM peak hour. Phase 3
was anticipated to cause Levels of Service (LOS) to degrade at the following intersections as
described below:

       •   AM Peak Hour
           o   Valley/Fairview and Republican/Phase 2 Driveway expected to drop from LOS C
               to LOS D;
           o   Republican/Dexter intersection expected to drop from LOS C to LOS E; and,
           o   Republican/8th Avenue intersection expected to drop from LOS B to LOS C.
       •   PM Peak hour
           o   Mercer/Westlake intersection expected to drop from LOS E to LOS F;
           o   Republican/Dexter and Republican/9th Avenue intersections expected to drop
               from LOS D to LOS F;
           o   Phase 2 driveway/Republican intersection expected to degrade from LOS C to
               LOS D; and,
           o   Denny/Fairview intersection expected to degrade from LOS D to LOS E.

Mitigation listed in the 2005 South Lake Union UW EIS listed implementation of a
Transportation Management Plan with aggressive goals.

2010 EIS Addendum
The Transportation Impact Analysis prepared by the Transpo Group for the 2010 EIS Addendum
estimated trip generation for both the Phase 3.1 and Phase 3.2 projects. The study estimated
Phase 3.1 would generate 590 daily trips, with 83 trips in the AM peak hour and 79 trips in the
PM peak hour. Phase 3.2 was estimated to generate 580 daily trips, with 82 in the AM peak
hour and 75 in the PM peak hour. One intersection was to be significantly impacted – the
intersection of Republican Street with Dexter Avenue N. However, it was noted that this
intersection was planned to be signalized, and the project’s mitigation payment would assist
with that mitigation improvement.

The 2010 EIS Addendum estimated that the garage for Phase 3.1 and Phase 3.2 would have 253
spaces. Peak parking demand for both phases was anticipated to be 283 stalls. The study
identified sufficient parking supply within walking distance of the site to accommodate the
projected parking spillover.

The Land Use Code applicable to Phase 3.1 and Phase 3.2 required a Transportation
Management Plan with a goal of no more than 40% of peak hour trips in single occupant
vehicles.

2016 EIS Addendum – Project Impacts
Transportation analysis completed for Phase 3.2 is presented in UW Medicine Phase 3.2
Transportation Impact Analysis 2 provided in Appendix B. This analysis included detailed trip
generation estimates for the proposed projects, forecast traffic volumes for the year of opening
(2018), and evaluated level of service for 17 study intersections in the site vicinity. It also
evaluated traffic safety conditions, transit availability, non-motorized travel, and parking
conditions within the study area. This analysis augments the transportation analysis performed
for the South Lake Union UW EIS, and provides detail about specific project impacts in the
immediate vicinity of the Phase 3.2.

Traffic

The proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 665 daily vehicle trips with 57
vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 80 new vehicle trips during the PM peak hour.

Vehicular access to Phase 3.2 is proposed via the existing driveway along Republican Street.
With the addition of Phase 3.2 traffic, the site access is anticipated to operate at LOS C during
the weekday AM and PM peak hours under future (2018) with-project conditions.

EIS).

UW Medicine: Lake Union Phase 3.2                    Section 2 – Comparison of Environment Impacts
2016 EIS Addendum                                6
In the immediate vicinity, the project’s percent traffic contribution to the Republican Street
intersections with 8th and 9th Avenues would be approximately 5 to 10 percent during the
weekday PM peak hour while all other off-site intersections are anticipated to experience a
project contribution of less than 2 percent as a result of Phase 3.2. All intersections are
forecasted to operate at LOS D or better during the weekday AM and PM Peak hours, or
operate at LOS E or worse with the project increasing delays by less than 5 seconds during the
weekday AM or PM peak hours.

The 2010 EIS Addendum evaluated 1,170 daily trips including 165 during the AM peak hour and
154 during the PM peak hour for the Phase 3.1 and 3.2 development. Considering the existing
Phase 3.1 development and the projected Phase 3.2, site trip generation is anticipated to be
approximately 880 daily vehicle trips with 82 during the AM peak hour and 106 during the PM
peak hour 3.

Trip generation for the site (Phases 3.1 and 3.2) is anticipated to be less than the impacts
evaluated in the 2010 EIS Addendum.

Parking

The South Lake Union UW EIS estimated up to 710 parking stalls as part of Phase 3 whereas the
2010 EIS Addendum estimated 253 spaces in the Phase 3 garage. The existing site has 233
parking spaces with a peak parking demand of 73 vehicles for Phase 3.1.

Aspects of the proposed action that will likely reduce parking demand include association with
the University, flexible work hours, commuting primarily via non-single occupancy vehicles and
access to the University shuttle system and UPASS program. The net increase in parking
demand as a result of the proposed Phase 3.2 is therefore projected to be 106 vehicles, which
would result in a total peak parking demand of 179 vehicles for the combined Phases 3.1 and
3.2. Peak parking demand would be fully accommodated within the existing 233 parking spaces.

Non-Motorized and Transit

Pedestrian, cyclist, and transit demand and services are described in Appendix B.

Marked crosswalks exist on all legs of the signalized study intersections. Protected bicycle lanes
are provided on Dexter Ave N, and striped bicycle lanes are located on 9th Ave N, Mercer and
Valley Streets. The Highway 99 realignment will provide additional connectivity for cyclists,
pedestrians, and transit lines.

There are no transit service changes in the site vicinity; however, with the completion of the
Viaduct the RapidRide E Line would be accessible from the site with a future transit stop at
Harrison Street. It is anticipated that transit ridership could increase during the weekday peak




3 Traffic counts were conducted at the existing Phase 3.1 development showing approximately 215 daily trips with 25 trips occurring
during the AM peak Hour and 26 trips during the PM peak hour (see Appendix B).

periods with the proposed project. The increase in ridership would be accommodated through
existing transit service and future planned improvements.

The site is well-served by bicycle facilities and on-site bicycle facilities are provided including a
bicycle parking within the existing parking garage. Based on field observations, the bicycle
parking within the garage is almost full during business hours.

Transportation Concurrency

The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with one
of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
transportation concurrency analysis in Appendix B indicates that with traffic generated by the
proposed project, the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c
threshold; thus, the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.

Potential Mitigation Measures

Bicycle Parking

Field observations indicate the on-site bicycle parking within the existing parking garage is
almost full. Consideration should be given to providing more on-site bicycle parking than
required by the Land Use Code. The vehicle parking demand analysis indicates that the existing
garage would not be fully utilized; therefore, there is a potential that bicycle parking could be
increased by converting a few vehicle parking spaces to bicycle parking.

Mitigation Payment

To mitigate impacts of the proposal on the surrounding transportation system, the developer
would be required to pay the South Lake Union transportation mitigation payment which funds
a combination of vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects located in the neighborhood.

The development mitigation payment schedule is set forth by SDCI’s TIP 243 – Transportation
Mitigation Payments. The developer is opting to pay based on a pro-rata share calculation,
which is based on the number of weekday PM peak hour trips using the South Lake Union
infrastructure. This mitigation fee is estimated to be $129,893. This fee is a preliminary
calculation and would be finalized by the City upon issuance of the decision on the proposed
project.

Transportation Management Plan

A TMP is required per SMC 23.48.230.F for the proposed project. SMC requires a 40 percent or
less single-occupant vehicle (SOV) rate for the site. The SOV goal per SMC 23.48.230.F is
measured based on the PM Peak hour for the site.

There is an existing TMP for Phase 3.1. The City would require that the TMP be updated and
modified to include both Phases 3.1 and 3.2 under a single TMP. This TMP requirement would
help to minimize off-site vehicular impacts of the proposed project.

Transportation Impact Analysis
UW Medicine Phase 3.2                                                                          August 2016



                                             Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of UW Medicine Phase 3.2. This project was previously
evaluated in the South Lake Union Research & Administrative Office Space: Phase 2 and 3
Development EIS, September 2005 and the South Lake Union Research & Administrative
Office Space: Phase 2 and 3 Development EIS Addendum UW Medicine: Lake Union Phase
3, August 2010. The purpose of this analysis is to verify that based on the current plans, and
changes to the background conditions in the area, no new significant adverse impacts would
occur as a result of the proposal. Where necessary, mitigation measures that would offset or
reduce significant transportation-related impacts that the proposed developments may have
on the surrounding transportation system are identified. This report also contains an
independent transportation impact fee calculation, consistent with methodologies for
developments in the South Lake Union area as outlined in the City’s Client Assistance Memo
243.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the north side of Republican Street between Dexter
Avenue N and 8th Avenue N, in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood as shown on
Figure 1. Phase 3.2 of the proposed project would develop approximately 139,030 square
feet of research and development space and 25,000 square feet of medical office and share
parking that is already developed on-site. As previously proposed, Phase 3.2 included
180,410 square feet of research and development space. Figure 2 illustrates the preliminary
site plan. It is anticipated that the development would be constructed and occupied by 2018.

The development is Phase 3.2 of the multiphase UW Medicine project that was analyzed in
the September 2005 EIS and August 2010 EIS Addendum. Phase 3.1, which is research and
development use, is already constructed and located on the adjacent parcel east of the
proposed project site. Phases 3.1 and 3.2 would share the existing parking garage and
access.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis is consistent with the previous transportation study1 completed in
2010. Based on the previous transportation study, the following intersections were selected
for analysis:


1. Westlake Avenue N/Valley Street                           10. 8th Avenue N/Republican Street

2. Fairview Avenue N/Valley Street                           11. 9th Avenue N/Republican Street

3. 5th Avenue N/Mercer Street                                12. Westlake Avenue N/Republican Street

4. Dexter Avenue N/Mercer Street                             13. Fairview Avenue N/Republican Street

5. 8th Avenue N/Mercer Street                                14. Dexter Avenue N/Denny Way

6. 9th Avenue N/Mercer Street                                15. 9th Avenue N/Denny Way

7. Westlake Avenue N/Mercer Street                           16. Westlake Avenue N/Denny Way

8. Fairview Avenue N/Mercer Street                           17. Fairview Avenue N/Denny Way

UW Medicine Phase 3.2                                                                   August 2016


The site access location on Republican Street was also analyzed under existing and future
(2018) conditions. The study focuses on the weekday AM and PM peak hour consistent with
the previous project. The report first describes existing and future (2018) without-project
conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the street system, existing and
future without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes, traffic operations,
traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2018) with-project
conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation
system were identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the future without-
project conditions.

This report updates the previously approved EIS to reflect updated:
        Land use
        Study area traffic conditions (volumes and intersection operations)
        Current traffic methodology, traffic patterns, analysis software, signal timing,
         intersection channelization, and changes to transit in the area

        Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes existing (2016) and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the street system, planned
improvements, existing and future forecasted without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service.

Street System
The following describes the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed project
and anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.

Existing
Characteristics of the existing street system in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is surrounded by multimodal facilities
accommodating vehicles, parking, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Fairview Avenue N has
parking restrictions along the west side during the AM peak period (7 to 9 a.m.) and along the
east side during the PM peak period (3 to 7 p.m.).

Future
This section identifies specific transportation improvements that will affect the future South
Lake Union transportation system. Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2016 – 2021
Proposed Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and WSDOT improvements, the Alaskan Way
Viaduct Replacement Program is the only street system transportation project identified in the
study area that is anticipated to be completed by 2018. This transportation project may affect
vehicle travel patterns in South Lake Union.

The Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Program is currently under construction and due to
delays WSDOT is reevaluating the schedule. This evaluation assumes the Viaduct would be
completed by 2018, the analysis horizon year. The project will provide a two-mile long tunnel
and connect S Royal Brougham Way in South Downtown to Mercer Street near the proposed
development project. The tunnel will replace the existing Alaskan Way Viaduct and Broad
Street tunnel and will connect to the existing SR 99 roadway on the north and south ends.
South of the site, the North Portal of SR 99 will be constructed, providing access to and from
SR 99 via Republican Street and Mercer Street/6th Avenue N.

The Adaptive Signal Control Implementation is currently under construction as part of the
Mercer Corridor project. Phase 2 of the project includes 17 intersections along Denny Way.
The project would include implementation of adaptive signal controls in Seattle Center and
South Lake Union and supports integrated corridor management on Denny Way, Mercer
Street, and SR 99 north tunnel access. This was not assumed to be completed for this
analysis since it is anticipated that the project would be completed by the end of 2019.


Traffic Volumes
The following summarizes the traffic volumes for existing (2016) and future (2018) without-
project conditions.

Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in March 2016. Figure 3 illustrates the
existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, rounded to the
nearest 5 vehicles. Detail traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.

Future
Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of one percent per year was applied to the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic
volumes at each study intersection. This growth rate is consistent with previously approved
traffic studies. Traffic from 23 pipeline projects in the project vicinity were also included in the
future (2018) without-project volume forecasts including:

Future (2018) without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.

The Dexter Avenue N/Republican Street intersection was under construction as part of the
Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement project at the time of the data collection. Construction
primarily affected the west leg of the intersection, which was closed. As a result, future (2018)
without-project volumes were estimated based on forecast volumes in the Seattle Arena Final
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) Appendix E – Transportation, May 2015 Seattle
Center No Action Alternative.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour
of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the intersection. Traffic
operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service
(LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme
congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS
criteria and definitions.

Weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic operations for existing (2016) and future (2018)
without-project conditions were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures
identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010) where possible, and were evaluated
using the Synchro 9 software program. Due to limitations of the HCM 2010 method in signal
phasing and exclusive phases for bicycles and the streetcar some intersections were
evaluated based on HCM 2000 as noted in the LOS summary tables. The most recent
available signal timing was acquired from the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT).
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of
the intersections. Under future 2018 conditions, signal timing maximum splits were optimized.

As noted previously, the Dexter Avenue N/Republican Street intersection was under
construction during data collection. The intersection is currently operating as a T-intersection
with right-turn only stop control on Republican Street but would be signalized and
reconfigured in the future. The intersection was evaluated as stop controlled under existing
conditions and as a 4-leg signalized intersection under future (2018) conditions with the west
leg operating primarily as a northbound off-ramp for SR 99. In addition, recent turn
restrictions were implemented at the Westlake Avenue N/Republican Street intersection.
Specifically, northbound left-turns and southbound left- and right-turns were restricted.
Counts were conducted after the turn restrictions were implemented, but vehicles were
observed making the restricted turning movements. Given that the new configuration of the
intersection is recent and drivers are still adjusting, the restricted movements counted were
removed and added to the through movements to account for current allowed movements.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2018) without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour conditions are summarized
in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed
are included in Appendix C.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from
the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2013
and December 31, 2015. In addition to the study intersections, collision data along project
frontages in the study area were analyzed to evaluate the vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle
safety. This information is summarized in Table 4.

SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The review
screens the previous year collisions for signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a
year, unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, midblock locations with 10 or more
collisions in the previous year and locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions in the
previous 3 years. SDOT’s Final Candidate Locations for 2016 HCL Reviews is the most
recent report. Based on 2015 data, SDOT has identified the Denny Way/Dexter Avenue
intersection as an HCL since it had 3 pedestrian collisions in 2014, 5 total between 2013 and
2015. A majority of the collisions at this location are related to left-turns. The City is
continuing to review this location and could identify improvements if the pattern of collisions
continues.

Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.

Existing
The study area is well-connected for pedestrian use with sidewalks on all streets.
Connectivity across SR 99 is limited. Marked crosswalks exist on all legs of the signalized
study intersections. No crosswalks are provided at the 8th Avenue/Mercer Street or the 8th
Avenue/Republican Street intersections.

Dexter Avenue N is a major north-south bicycle street that provides striped and separated
bicycle lanes between Fremont and Downtown. Ninth Avenue North also provides striped
bicycle lanes that enable mobility through South Lake Union, the Denny Triangle, and
Downtown areas. Both Mercer and Valley Streets have new pedestrian/bicycle paths;
however, portions are closed due to construction. A protected bike lane is also provided
along 5th Avenue N between Mercer Street and Republican Street.

North of the site along South Lake Union, the Cheshiahud Lake Union Trail connects the
South Lake Union neighborhood with Gasworks Park and links a number of pocket parks that
ring the lake.

Future
In the immediate vicinity of the site, according to the Adopted Seattle Bicycle Master Plan,
April 2014, an in-street bike lane with minor separation is recommended along Republican
Street. It is anticipated that improvements to the sidewalk system would occur as properties
are redeveloped along the corridor.

In addition, the Viaduct project will reconnect John, Thomas and, Harrison Streets, which are
bisected by SR 99, and provide sidewalk connectivity directly to the Seattle Center area and
the RapidRide E Line along SR 99.


Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.

Existing
Bus transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit. King County
Metro operates approximately 9 bus routes and 1 street car route in the area with 10 stops
within a 1/4-mile radius of the proposed project. The nearest bus stops are located along Dexter
Avenue N at Harrison Street approximately 525-feet southwest (or a 2- to 3-minute walk) from
the project site. Additional bus stops are located on Dexter Avenue north of Mercer Street and
9th Avenue N.

Future
There are no transit service changes in the site vicinity based on available plans; however,
with the completion of the Viaduct project site users would have access to the RapidRide E
Line. A future transit stop will be provided at Harrison Street with completion of the Alaskan
Way Viaduct Replacement Program. As discussed previously, Harrison Street, which is
bisected by SR 99, will be reconnected as part of the Viaduct project allowing for pedestrian
access.

                                              Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
street system and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic generated by the proposed
project are distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within the study
area for the weekday AM and PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-
project traffic volumes and the potential impacts to traffic operations, safety, transit, and non-
motorized facilities are identified.


Trip Generation
Trip generation for the two components of the project (research and development and
medical office) was estimated based on two approaches. The research and development
approach takes into consideration that the proposal (Phase 3.2) is an expansion of the
operations already occurring on the Phase 3.1 site adjacent to the project. The medical office
approach considers existing travel characteristics of uses within South Lake Union. This
approach was utilized to capture the unique nature of the existing and proposed research and
development facility as well as the more standard medical office.

Research and Development
As discussed previously, Phase 3.1, which is research and development use, is already
constructed and located on the adjacent parcel east of the proposed project site. Phases 3.1
and 3.2 would share the existing parking garage and access. The proposed project research
and development component would have similar operations to the existing Phase 3.1 facility
and employee commuter benefits would be the same. The existing research and
development facility operates 24 hours a day with no specific shifts and many employees
work outside the typical 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours. Employees of the existing facility are
associated with the University of Washington with many faculty, staff, undergraduate,
graduate, and post-doc students going back-and-forth between the existing facility and the
main campus on a daily basis. The University provides a shuttle between this South Lake
Union facility, the main campus, Harborview, and Fred Hutch reducing reliance on auto.
Similar to the University main campus, a large proportion of the existing population walks,
bikes, or rides transit to the South Lake Union site. Employees are eligible for the UPASS
transportation commute program and the bicycle storage facility was observed to be full
during several site visits.

To estimate the existing trip generation rate of the research and development component,
weekday AM and PM peak hour vehicle counts were collected for two-days at the existing
site access driveway along Republican Street. Data was collected in March and April 2016. In
addition, daily counts were collected in May 2016. A summary of the average existing trip
generation and the resulting rate is summarized in Table 5. The trip generation calculations
are summarized in Appendix D.

As shown in Table 5, the average trip rate during the weekday AM and PM peak hours is
0.15 vehicles per 1,000 square feet of research and development use. This trip rate and
inbound and outbound trip distribution is used to estimate the vehicle trips for the proposed
research and development (see Table 6). As discussed previously, the Phase 3.2 employees
are anticipated to have similar characteristics to the existing employees including association
with the University, flexible work hours, commuting primarily via non-single occupancy
vehicles and access to the University shuttle system and UPASS program. These travel
characteristics result in a relatively low trip generation per square-foot for the proposed
research and development.

Additionally, 24-hour counts were collected at the site access location for 7 days to verify the
peak periods of the existing Phase 3.1 research and development facility. The daily traffic
counts are provided in Appendix A. The data shows that the existing Phase 3.1 research and
development facility peaks during the typical 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. commute periods
consistent with this traffic analysis.

Medical Office
Project trip generation for the medical office was estimated based on calculating person trips
and then estimating the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations
and over-predict the number of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a
larger portion of trips served by alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given
the mix of development and level of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




                                                                                                  15

Total person trips were developed for the proposed uses based on trip rates from the Trip
Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Average vehicle occupancy (AVO) was estimated from the
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating
Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed Medical-Dental Office (#720).

The Commute Seattle’s 2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split report summarizes Commute
Trip Reduction (CTR) data by Seattle neighborhood. The data shows, for the South Lake
Union neighborhood, approximately 57 percent of employee trips were made by auto (45
percent single occupancy vehicles and 12 percent carpool/vanpool), 25 percent by transit,
and 15 percent walking, biking, or other modes. Appendix D provides the detailed trip
generation calculation.

Table 6 summarizes the estimated weekday daily, AM, and PM peak hour trip generation for
the proposed land uses.

1. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.
2. Vehicle trips based on existing site trip generation.


As shown in Table 6, the proposed project is anticipated to generate approximately 665 daily
vehicle trips with 57 vehicle trips during the AM peak hour and 80 new vehicle trips during the
PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
The trip distribution and assignment of vehicular traffic to and from the proposed project sites
were based on those identified in the South Lake Union Research & Administrative Office
Space: Phase 2 and 3 Development EIS Addendum UW Medicine: Lake Union Phase 3,
August 2010, as well as a review of existing travel patterns, planned improvements, and
recent transportation studies conducted in the vicinity.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrates the expected project vehicle trip distribution for inbound and
outbound vehicles, respectively, to the surrounding local and regional street system.
The weekday AM and PM peak hour trips were assigned to the study area based on the
travel patterns shown on Figure 5 and Figure 6 and the location of the existing site access.
The project traffic was added to future without-project weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic
volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2018 with-project traffic
volumes are shown on Figure 7.

As shown in Table 7, the proposed project is anticipated to account for less than 2 percent of
the total weekday PM peak hour traffic at the off-site study intersections with the exception of
two intersections adjacent to the site. The project share at the 8th Avenue N/Republican
Street intersection is anticipated to be approximately 10 percent and at the 9th Avenue N/
Republican Street intersection it is anticipated to be approximately 5 percent. Traffic volumes
typically fluctuate day-to-day by five to ten percent depending on factors such as the day of
the week, weather conditions, and traffic conditions elsewhere in the surrounding street
network. This increase in traffic volumes related to project traffic falls within these normal
fluctuations.


Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday AM and PM peak hours to
analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as
described for existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters
such as channelization and traffic control were consistent with those used in the evaluation of
future without-project conditions. A comparison of future without and with-project weekday
AM peak hour traffic operations is summarized in Table 8 and PM peak hour traffic
operations are summarized in Table 9. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 8, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with little to no change in calculated delays during the AM peak hour. All intersections are
anticipated to operate at the same LOS as under without-project conditions with the
exception of the 9th Avenue N/Mercer Street intersection, which is anticipated to degrade
from LOS B to LOS C with approximately a 1 second increase in overall intersection delay.
Typically, the City does not consider an impact significant if increases in delay are 5 seconds
or less.

As indicated in Table 9, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
with little to no change in calculated delays during the PM peak hour. All intersections are
anticipated to operate at the same LOS as under without-project conditions and no new
significant impacts are identified.


Site Access Evaluation
The proposed project includes an underground parking garage. Access to each garage would
be provided via the existing access along Republican Street which will be shared with the
current development. The site access is anticipated to operate at LOS C during the weekday
AM and PM peak hours under future (2018) with-project conditions.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Screenlines are imaginary lines drawn across primary roadways to monitor traffic going from
one side to the other. The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review,
consistent with the August 2010 EIS Addendum. The screenlines that were analyzed for
concurrency review include Ship Canal to Freemont Bridge (Screenline 5.12), Ship Canal to
Aurora Avenue N (Screenline 5.13), Ship Canal to University and Montlake Bridges
(Screenline 5.16), and South of Lake Union (Screenline 8), as shown in Table 10. As a

 conservative estimate, it was assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the
 direction of the screenlines would extend across the screenlines included in this analysis.

 The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
 project, the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
 the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


 Parking Analysis
 The following sections describe the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking
 demand of the project, and parking code requirements.

 Supply
 Parking for the proposed project would be shared with the existing below ground parking
 garage. The existing below grade parking garage has a supply of 233 stalls and is accessed
 via Republican Street.

 Demand
 In order to determine if the proposed parking could be accommodated in the existing garage,
 both the existing parking demand and the proposed project future demand were reviewed.

 Existing Demand
 The demand associated with the existing research and development use was collected
 during a typical midweek day in March 2016 between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. This time period
 was selected because it represents the typical hours of peak parking of both the research
 and development and medical office uses based on a review of ITE Parking Generation (4th
 Edition). The existing use peaked between 12 and 1 p.m. with approximately 73 vehicles.

 Future Demand
 The peak parking demand is expected to be below national averages due the project’s
 proximity to transit service and its relative location to South Lake Union, a high-density urban
 village with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. In addition, as
 discussed previously, the Phase 3.2 research and development employees are anticipated to
 have similar characteristics to the existing employees including association with the
 University, flexible work hours, commuting primarily via non-single occupancy vehicles and
 access to the University shuttle system and UPASS program. These travel characteristics



                                                                                                                      23
Transportation Impact Analysis
UW Medicine Phase 3.2                                                                August 2016


result in a relatively low parking demand. Similar to trip generation, peak parking demand for
the proposed project was estimated based on the existing research and development parking
demand and consideration of local mode splits for the medical office. Detailed calculations
are provided in Appendix E. Both of the uses are anticipated to peak during the midday
period.

Research and Development. As mentioned previously, the proposed research and
development use is anticipated to have similar operations as the existing research and
development use. As such, the future proposed project parking demand was estimated based
on the existing use. The existing research and development is 170,218 square feet and the
peak parking demand was approximately 73 vehicles. This results in a peak parking demand
of 0.43 vehicles per 1,000 square feet of research and development use. Based on the
proposed 139,030 square-foot research and development use the peak parking demand is
anticipated to be 60 vehicles.

Medical Office. For the medical office the weekday peak parking demand was estimated
based on data provided in ITE Parking Generation (4th Edition), and local mode of travel data
consistent with the trip generation analysis. Based on ITE medical office use (land use 720)
has an average parking rate of 3.20 spaces per 1,000 square feet; this rate is reduced based
on the local vehicle mode split. The vehicle mode split based on CTR data is 57 percent of
the medical office travel, which results in rate of 1.82 stalls per 1,000 square feet of medical
office. When taking into account carpools (45 percent drove alone, 12 percent carpooled)
results in a peak parking rate of 1.63 stalls per 1,000 square feet of medical office. Using
these rates, the estimated peak parking demand could range between 41 and 46 vehicles for
the medical office land use.

The total future parking, inclusive of the existing demand, is summarized in Table 11.

1.   sf= Square Feet


As shown in Table 11, the total future peak parking demand is anticipated to be
approximately 179 vehicles including the peak parking demand associated with the existing
research and development building. Based on an existing supply of 233 stalls, the future
demand of 179 vehicles is anticipated to be accommodated on site with a surplus of
approximately 54 stalls.

Parking Code Analysis
This section outlines the parking code requirements for vehicular and bicycle parking.

Off-Street Vehicle Parking
As noted previously, the project includes 233 below ground garage parking spaces. Per
Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there is no minimum parking requirement for the
development since it is located within the South Lake Union urban center.




                                                                                              24

Bicycle Parking
Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

Per SMC 23.54.015, bicycle parking is required to be provided by new developments. The
SMC requires secure, covered long-term bicycle parking for office developments. Due to the
project’s Urban Center location and the anticipation that it will have fewer vehicle and more
non-motorized trips, the bicycle storage rate is higher. The bicycle parking requirements for
the site are shown in Table 12.

1.   sf = Square Feet
2.   From Seattle Municipal Code 23.54.015, Table D.


As shown in Table 12, the proposed development is required to provide 41 long-term bicycle
parking spaces and 5 short-term bicycle parking space. It is noted that the existing bicycle
facilities appeared full during field observations. It is recommended that consideration be
given to providing more bicycle parking than required. Since not all the vehicle parking is
expected to be needed, additional bicycle parking could be provided by converting one or two
vehicle parking stalls into bicycle parking spaces.


EIS Consistency
The impacts associated with the proposed development of Phase 3.2 are consistent with the
impacts identified in South Lake Union Research & Administrative Office Space: Phase 2 and
3 Development EIS, September 2005 and the South Lake Union Research & Administrative
Office Space: Phase 2 and 3 Development EIS Addendum UW Medicine: Lake Union Phase
3, August 2010.

The 2010 EIS Addendum disclosed impacts for three phases of UW Medicine development
Phases 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. Phases 3.1 and 3.2 were part of the Master Use Permit (MUP)
#3011312 approved while Phase 3.3 would be a future phase of development. The current
proposal evaluated in this transportation study is a refined Phase 3.2.

Trip Generation
The approved development evaluated in the 2010 EIS Addendum included183,450 square-
feet of research and development for Phase 3.1 and 180,410 square-feet of research and
development for Phase 3.2. Phase 3.1 is fully constructed and includes 170,218 square-feet
of research and development and the current proposal for Phase 3.2 includes approximately
25,000 square feet of medical office and 139,030 square feet of research and development
center. A summary of the previously approved trip generation compared to the existing Phase
3.1 and proposed Phase 3.2 trip generation is summarized in Table 13.

2. Vehicle trip generation based in site traffic counts in March, April, and May 2016.
3. Vehicle trips were estimated based on person trip calculations and localized mode split information.
4. Vehicle trips based on existing site trip generation.


As shown in Table 13, with development of Phase 3.2 the site would generate less trips than
disclosed in the 2010 EIS Addendum.

UW Medicine Phase 3.2                                                              August 2016



                    Mitigation and Recommendations
The project impacts to the surrounding transportation system would be mitigated through
South Lake Union transportation mitigation payment. In addition, a Transportation
Management Program (TMP) is required per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.48.230.F.


Transportation Mitigation Payment
The City has implemented a program in and around the South Lake Union neighborhood that
requires new developments to contribute towards planned improvements identified in the
South Lake Union Transportation Plan. Improvements in this transportation plan include a
combination of vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects located in the neighborhood
which would benefit all users.

The development mitigation payment schedule is set forth by DPD’s Client Assistance Memo
243 – Transportation Mitigation Payments. The developer is opting to pay based on a pro-
rata share calculation, which is based on the number of weekday PM peak hour trips using
the South Lake Union infrastructure. This mitigation fee is estimated to be $138,639, as
shown in Appendix F. This fee is a preliminary calculation and would be finalized by the City
upon issuance of the decision on the proposed project.


Transportation Management Program
A TMP is required per SMC 23.48.230.F for the proposed project. SMC requires a 40 percent
or less single-occupant vehicle (SOV) rate for the site. The SOV goal per SMC 23.48.230.F is
measured based on the PM Peak hour for the site.

There is an existing TMP for Phase 3.1. The City would require that the TMP be updated and
modified to include both Phases 3.1 and 3.2 under a single TMP. This TMP requirement
would help to minimize off-site vehicular impacts of the proposed project

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the UW Medicine Phase 3.2
development. General findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would approximately 25,000 square feet of medical office and
           139,030 square feet of research and development center.
          The proposed development is anticipated to generate approximately 1,290 new
           daily trips with 57 new trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 80 new trips
           during the PM peak hour.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          Parking would be fully accommodated within the proposed the parking garages with
           a surplus of approximately 54 stalls.
          Trip generation is anticipated to be less than projected with the 2010 Addendum
           EIS; therefore no new significant transportation impacts identified.
          Impacts of the proposal would be mitigated through the transportation mitigation
           payment and preparation of an updated transportation management program
           (TMP).
