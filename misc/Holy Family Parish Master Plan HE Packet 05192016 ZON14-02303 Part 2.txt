File No: PRE14-00695
Parcel: 09205-9018

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Holy Family Parish is requesting a Zoning Permit for a phased Master Plan.

Phase One – which would occur within five years, involves the development of the north end of
our campus. In an effort to provide more off street parking to parishioners for weekend Masses
and events, we are planning to install a new parking lot adjacent to the north side of the Parish
Education Center. This parking lot will have a covered structure over half of it which will allow
outdoor play for the children during inclement weather. This lot will mainly be used as
playground area, but will serve as overflow parking during high demand events. The lot will be
gated, and accessed from 119th Avenue.
        Also in an effort to insure the safety of our littlest ones, we are planning to create an off-
street pre-school drop off which will be entered from 119th Avenue NE, and will exit onto NE 75th
street. Adjacent to this small lot, we will have a new maintenance shed and storage facility for
St. Vincent DePaul Society donations. The parking lots will have landscape buffer screening to
minimize the visual impact. Tree retention has been a priority, and professional arborists have
been employed help develop a scheme that will keep as many existing trees as possible. The
street frontage along 119th Avenue NE and NE 75th Street will be developed with sidewalks and
planting strips per City of Kirkland design standards.

Phase Two – which would occur within 5-10 years, involves expanding our current church nave
to accommodate more parishioner during Mass. We anticipate offering fewer opportunities per
week to attend Mass, so the number of parishioners per Mass would go up, but we expect no
over-all weekly increase in attendance. The church expansion would have a similar scale and
appearance to the current church, with the same overall ridge height, and a limited footprint
increase of 3322 SF.

STATEMENT OF ZONING COMPLIANCE
Review Process: We anticipate a Process IIB zoning permit process.

Variances:
Variance Requested: Building Height – existing building is 37’-6” tall to the ridge of the roof. The
proposed roof ridge will be 36’-6” tall, with a small copula that extends higher to a height of 43’-
6”. We are requesting a variance for building height, as the zone height limit is 30’. The edge of
the roof that is not in compliance is 89’ away from the east property line and 97’ away from the
west property line.

Setbacks for School Use:
All structured play areas are 20’ or more from the property line.

Lot Coverage:
The proposed lot coverage is 64.6%, which is below the 70% threshold for RSX zones.

Height:
The proposed Phase 2 Nave renovation will replace the existing non-compliant roof with a new
non-compliant roof form of approximately the same height. See variance request above.

Landscape Buffers:
KZC Section 95.42.1 buffer standard 1 will be provided along 119th Avenue and along 75th Street
between day-care drop off/parking lot and the street.

Parking Lot Location:
A minimum set back to the parking lot of 20’ from the property line is provided.

Pedestrian Walkways Through Parking Lot:
A walkway designed to comply with KZC 105.18.3.d is provided in the main parking lot.

 Tree Retention:
A professional arborist has been employed to help develop a tree retention plan. The Master
Plan parking and play area layouts have been modified somewhat from the previous Master Plan
in order to protect and retain more trees on site.

Parking:
Transpo Group Parking and Traffic Assessment has been attached.

Sincerely,



Kevin J. Broderick, AIA

RETENTION OF SIGNIFICANT TREES, CHAPTER 95
The City’s objective is to retain as many viable trees as possible on a development site
while still allowing the development proposal to move forward in a timely manner. In
order to make better decisions about tree retention, an approved tree retention plan that
establishes the priorities of tree retention is required for zoning permit applications. Tree
retention values are assessed based on the site, the location of trees and the information
provided by the applicant’s arborist.

The following tree retention values, based on Kirkland Zoning Code definitions, for the
project are listed below:

The High Retention Value trees on this site are Trees 3092, 3093, 3105, 3110, 3125 and
3141. Per the requirements in KZC 95.30, the applicant is required to retain and protect
High Retention Value trees to the maximum extent possible. High Retention value trees
are significant viable trees that are located within required yards or landscape buffers
and fit the criteria defined in KZC 95.10.

The Moderate Retention Value trees are Trees 3102, 5488, 5489, 5490, 3103, 3107,
3109, 3100, 3101, 3082, 3127, 3128, 3130 and 3129. Moderate Retention Value trees
are viable trees that are to be retained if feasible.

The Low Retention Value trees are Trees 3111, 3121, 5523, 3131, 3132, 3115, 3114,
3140, 3119, 3118 and 3120. These are typed as Low Retention Value trees based on
their current condition or are located in an area where removal is unavoidable due to
the anticipated development activity.

No trees are approved for removal with the approval of a zoning permit. A new retention
plan shall be required at each phase of the project as more information about the
location of the proposed improvements is known, subject to the requirements in KZC
95.30.

BUILDING General Conditions: Contact: Tom Jensen tjensen@kirklandwa.gov
1. A geotechnical report is required to address commercial development activity. The report must be prepared by
a Washington State licensed Professional Engineer. Recommendations contained within the report shall be
incorporated into the design of the Short Plat and subsequent structures.
2. This parcel is comprised of multiple lots and must be consolidated prior to permit issuance. A Lot Consolidation
by Restrictive Covenant document will be created by the City for signature by the property owners and sent to King
County for recording at the time of permit issuance.
3. Prior to issuance of Building, Demolition or Landsurface Modification permit applicant must submit a proposed
rat baiting program for review and approval. Kirkland Municipal Ordinance 9.04.040
4. Plumbing meter and service line shall be sized in accordance with the current UPC. We are currently using the
2012 edition.
5. Building permits must comply with the International Building and Mechanical Codes and the Uniform Plumbing
Code as adopted and amended by the State of Washington and the City of Kirkland. Kirkland currently has adopted
the 2012 editions. For permit submittal, please provide an analysis of the allowable area based on type of
construction of each building and allowed openings with regard to fire separation distance to imaginary property
lines. Because the Covered Play Structure will also be used for parking cars, please show compliance with IBC
Section 406.5 for Open Parking Garages in particular the types of construction allowed. If the Parish Education
Center is not of Type I, II or IV construction, then it and the new Covered Play Structure cannot be considered as
portions of one building per IBC Section 503.1.2. This would require measuring fire separation distances from an
imaginary property line between them which would most likely limit the openings allowed on each building. Similarly
an imaginary property line between the (E) Parish Center and the proposed additions to the Church could limit
allowed openings if these 2 building cannot be considered as one.
6. Structures must comply with International Energy Conservation Code as adopted and amended by the State of
Washington. We are currently using the 2012 edition.
7. Kirkland reviews, issues and inspects all electrical permits in the city. Kirkland currently uses the 2009
Washington Cities Electrical Code chapters 1 and 3 as published by WABO.
8. Structures must be designed for seismic design category D, wind speed of 110 miles per hour and exposure B.
9. Nonstructural components must be designed for seismic design category D, wind speed of 110 miles per hour
and exposure B. ASCE 7 - 10
10. The applicant is cautioned to investigate the implications of the Americans with Disabilities Act on the
construction of this project. For more information the applicant may contact the Office of the General Counsel,
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 1111 18th Street, N.W., Suite 501, Washington, DC

SPRINKLER THRESHOLD
Per Kirkland Municipal Code, all new buildings which are 5,000 gross square feet or larger require fire sprinklers.
The covered play structure described in the application would be subject to the sprinkler requirement if over 5,000
square feet.

EXISTING HYDRANTS AND FIRE FLOW ARE ADEQUATE
No additional hydrants would be required for the proposed project. Fire flow is approximately 2700 gpm, which is
adequate.

Water System Conditions:

1. The existing water main in the public right-of-way along the front of the subject property is adequate to serve
this proposed development unless it is found the more on-site hydrants or fire flow is needed in which case some
system upgrades will be necessary.

Surface Water Conditions:

Provide temporary and permanent storm water control per the 2009 King County Surface Water Design Manual
and the Kirkland Addendum (Policy D-10) or the adopted standard in place at the time of Building Permit and Land
Surface Modification Permit submittal. Under the 2009 King County SWDM that following would be applied:

Full Drainage Review
A full drainage review is required for any proposed project, new or redevelopment, that will:
 Adds 5,000ft2 or more of new impervious surface area or 10,000ft2 or more of new plus replaced impervious
surface area,
 Propose 7,000ft2 or more of land disturbing activity, or,
 Be a redevelopment project on a single or multiple parcel site in which the total of new plus replaced
impervious surface area is 5,000ft2 or more and whose valuation of proposed improvements (including interior
improvements but excluding required mitigation and frontage improvements) exceeds 50% of the assessed value
of the existing site improvements.

1. Evaluate the feasibility and applicability of dispersion, infiltration, and other stormwater low impact development
facilities on-site (per section 5.2 in the 2009 King County Surface Water Design Manual). If feasible, stormwater
low impact development facilities are required. See PW Pre-Approved Plan Policy L-1 or L-2 (depending on
drainage review) for more information on this requirement.

2. Because this project site is one acre or greater, the following conditions apply:
•    Amended soil requirements (per Ecology BMP T5.13) must be used in all landscaped areas.
•    If the project meets minimum criteria for water quality treatment (5,000ft2 pollution generating impervious
surface area), the enhanced level of treatment is required if the project is multi-family residential, commercial, or
industrial. Enhanced treatment targets the removal of metals such as copper and zinc.
•    The applicant is responsible to apply for a Construction Stormwater General Permit from Washington State
Department of Ecology. Provide the City with a copy of the Notice of Intent for the permit. Permit Information can
be found at the following website: http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/stormwater/construction/
o Among other requirements, this permit requires the applicant to prepare a Storm Water Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) and identify a Certified Erosion and Sediment Control Lead (CESCL) prior to the start of
construction. The CESCL shall attend the City of Kirkland PW Dept. pre-construction meeting with a completed
SWPPP.
•    Turbidity monitoring by the developer/contractor is required if a project contains a lake, stream, or wetland.
•    A Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Spill (SWPPS) Plan must be kept on site during all phases of
construction and shall address construction-related pollution generating activities. Follow the guidelines in the 2009

Street and Pedestrian Improvement Conditions:

1. The subject property abuts 122nd Ave. NE and NE 75th Street. These streets are Neighborhood Access type
streets. Zoning Code sections 110.10 and 110.25 require the applicant to make half-street improvements in
rights-of-way abutting the subject property. Section 110.30-110.50 establishes that this street must be improved
with the following:

120th Ave. NE-
Complete the ½ street improvements on the north end of the campus to match the improvements to the south.
Curbs, sidewalks, and storm drainage shall be installed but the design will account for the existing trees and avoid
impact on the trees. The sidewalk may have to be located in a pedestrian easement behind the trees.

NE 75th Street-
Along the entire property frontage, install ½ street improvements that match the curb alignment to the east. Install
storm drainage, curbs, a 4.5 ft. wide landscape strip with street trees 30 ft. o.c. and a 5 ft. wide sidewalk.

119th Ave. NE-
From NE 75th St. to the south end of the street (entrance to parking lot) install ½ street improvements on the east
half of the street (14 ft. from centerline to face of new curb). Install storm drainage, curbs, a 4.5 ft. wide landscape
strip with street trees 30 ft. o.c. and a 5 ft. wide sidewalk.

All of these improvements shall be installed when the new parking lots on the north end of the site are installed

                                                                                                                     Attachment 4




2. All street and driveway intersections shall not have any visual obstructions within the sight distance triangle.
See Public Works Pre-approved Policy R.13 for the sight distance criteria and specifications.

3. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to relocate any above-ground or below-ground utilities which
conflict with the project associated street or utility improvements.

4.   Underground all new and existing on-site utility lines and overhead transmission lines.

5. Zoning Code Section 110.60.9 establishes the requirement that existing utility and transmission (power,
telephone, etc.) lines on-site and in rights-of-way adjacent to the site must be underground. The Public Works
Director may determine if undergrounding transmission lines in the adjacent right-of-way is not feasible and defer
the undergrounding by signing an agreement to participate in an undergrounding project, if one is ever proposed.
In this case, the Public Works Director has determined that undergrounding of existing overhead utility on all street
frontages is not feasible at this time and the undergrounding of off-site/frontage transmission lines should be
deferred with a Local Improvement District (LID) No Protest Agreement. The final recorded subdivision mylar shall
include the following note:

Local Improvement District (LID) Waiver Agreement. Chapter 110.60.7.b of the Kirkland Zoning Code requires all
overhead utility lines along the frontage of the subject property to be converted to underground unless the Public
Works Director determines that it is infeasible to do so at the time of the subdivision recording. If it is determined
to be infeasible, then the property owner shall consent to the formation of a Local Improvement District, hereafter
formed by the City or other property owners. During review of this subdivision it was determined that it was
infeasible to convert the overhead utility lines to underground along the frontage of this subdivision on (((street
name))). Therefore, in consideration of deferring the requirement to underground the overhead utility lines at the
time of the subdivision recording, the property owner and all future property owners of lots within this subdivision
hereby consent to the formation of a Local Improvement District hereafter formed by the City or other property
owners

6. New street lights may be required per Puget Power design and Public Works approval. Contact the INTO Light
Division at PSE for a lighting analysis. If lighting is necessary, design must be submitted prior to issuance of a
grading or building permit.

I am sending this in regards to the proposed expansion  of Holy Family Parish New Master Plan. As a resident and 
neighbor of the parish I have seen a great deal of change over the more than 25 years I have lived here. I reside on NE 
75th and have had concerns over the traffic on this road for decades. The recent expansion of the Lake Washington 
School that is directly adjacent to the Parish has added more traffic on this road as well. While the traffic study that has 
been provided may say that the expansion would not generate additional weekday AM or PM peak hour trips I do 
believe that the new drop off drive thru and additional parking will change the traffic pattern resulting in even more 
congestion on 75th and 119th. The current use of driveway #1 has very limited impact on 75th as it is simply a parking 
area, not a drop off /drive thru. The intersection of 119th Ave NE and 75th is a very dangerous place with limited sight to 
the west on 75th and the added flow onto 75th from 119th from this drive thru traffic seems like a very bad plan. 
Interesting that no study was done on the intersection of 119th and 75th, this is a big concern for me as it’s a safety issue 
for those using 75th. The traffic on 75th is bad enough already with the High School student/parents/bus  and Church and 
school traffic. 
  The Sunday traffic is already nasty if you try to go anywhere in the area at the wrong time. The added overflow parking 
and drop off parking area will add more cars to the 119th Ave and NE 75th street congestion. I really feel for the folks who 
happen to live on 74th and want to get out at the wrong time of day. The issues already exist and adding more cars and 
access points to the road is not going to make it better, just worse. Just because it passes code in the book does not 
make it the right thing to do. 
 
How about the lot coverage/ impervious surface calculations ? Where is all the water going from this new paved area. 
How about sending all the cars out onto NE 70th near the soccer field ? That is a major road that may not impact the 
local residents in such a negative way. I oppose this expansion simply by the fact that it’s making a bad situation worse 
for the people that call this home and not just a drive thru.

Attention: Jon Regala, Project Planner, City of Kirkland


Subject: Permit No. ZON14-02303

        “Holy Family Parish Proposed Master Plan”

        Please see our concern about this project as below:

        1) The existing traffic due to daily school activities is already overloading 119th avenue, along with the
           75th and 74th intersection. These streets are not wide but the people drive fast and occupy mostly the
           middle of the street without considering the opposite car on the other side. The traffic is very high
           during morning and afternoon every day.
        2) In addition, how can you guarantee us that even with this addition to parking, cars visiting your
           church or buildings will stop parking on 74th street and 119th avenue? This has created a very hectic
           scenario for many years, especially on weekends. Even with these new parking lots, there is no
           guarantee that cars will stop parking on our street, making things even more busy and congested.
        3) By opening another gate in 119th avenue, the traffic will be elevated to higher level and the
           intersection between 119th avenue and 75th street is going to busy at all times, especially with the two
           parking lots and 74th street merging into one tiny road (119th avenue).
        4) Lake Washington High School starts every morning during the school year around the same time as
           your school does, creating even more traffic and congestion in the morning within three tiny segments
           of street (119th, 120th, and 75th). This will be inconvenient for all parties, including the residents
           around here, your parents/students, and the high school parents/students.
        5) A few years ago, you spent quite a while renovating your buildings, as well as constructing new ones.
           This was an inconvenience to the residents around here, and these two upcoming phases prognosticate
           a similar effect. 5-10 years is a long time for construction, and will be especially inconvenient for
           residents on 74th street. Our road is a dead end, and we can only leave through 119th avenue, which is
           where you are supposedly planning your construction these next few years.
        6) This long period for construction will also bring a lot of noise to our neighborhood, and I am sure that
           you understand that this will be hard to live with during the extremely long Phases that you are
           proposing.
        7) Based on all mentioned above the most important thing for us in neighborhood is that our house value
           will go down because of Holy Family Expansion project. With more school traffic, more noise and
           parking problems, nobody wants to buy a house in area.
           Our existing house is our most valuable asset for our family and still has to pay our mortgages for
           years to come. We cannot afford to lose our house value.
           Thanks for your consideration.

            Regards,

            Mehrdad & Shahrnaz Mehrvarzan

re: "Holy Family Parish Proposed Master Plan Submittal Parcel: 09205-9018

To Margot Washington,

We live at 11812 NE 741h St, and we were recently informed of your expansion plans. We do
not like having to deal with the heavy traffic and at times tight parking but my biggest concern is
not of inconvenience but safety. My mother is 71 years old and lives next door to me. I fear
that one day I will need to call an emergency vehicle and they will not be able to get to us.
Traffic and parking blocks our street at times and it is tight to get even a small car to our home.
Please consider using the larger and more accessible street on the other side of holy family for
your expansion.

Subject: “Holy Family Parish Proposed Master Plan Submittal”
        Parcel: 09205-9018

We live at 11815 NE 74th St, and were just informed of your expansion plans and are not happy at all.
Currently the traffic caused by your back-gate driveway is overwhelming to the small dead end street we
live on. The morning school traffic, which is 100% directed out the back gate, blocks the street for those
of us trying to get our own children to school on time. The people exiting through that same back gate
almost never Stop! let alone slow down. Numerous times we have almost had an accident with cars
driving out your back entrance. They drive out as if they are already on an actual road, not exiting a
parking lot. Then in the afternoon, same scenario all over, with us trying to get out to pick up our kids
from elementary school.

Our family also is always out and about bicycling around the neighborhood, and if there is a mass
beginning the people drive 40-50mph through the small streets so they aren’t late. We already try to plan
our outings around these start times for masses. People would rather be on time for mass, than put public
safety first.

We think if any expansion of your facility is to take place; the back-gate exit onto 119th should be closed
permanently. It could still be there for emergency vehicles and such, but currently more people use the
back entrance than they use your main front entrance. You are forcing all your traffic onto our no-outlet
residential street. You could also build your expansion on your Soccer field thus directing all the
increased traffic onto NE 70th street which could handle the increased traffic. Then put the play field at
the end where you want 3 new driveways and new buildings.

Our other 20+ neighbors are also not pleased with your expansion proposal. We want a better solution to
your need for expansion.

MEMORANDUM

To:            Eric R. Shields, AICP, SEPA Responsible Official

From:          Tony Leavitt, Senior Planner

Date:          February 8, 2016

File:          SEP14-02342, ZON14-02303

Subject:       STATE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (SEPA) ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION
               HOLY FAMILY PARISH MASTER PLAN

PROPOSAL
The subject property is located at 7300 120th Avenue NE (see Enclosure 1) and contains the Holy
Family church, youth center, school, and parish center. The property also includes a large soccer
field and several surface parking lots that support the school and church uses. The Holy Family
campus also includes the property located at 12003 NE 75th Street which contains the rectory and
parcel 640070-0402 which contains a gravel parking lot that provides 30 overflow parking stalls
for the church.
The applicant, John Faley with Broderick Architects, has applied for SEPA review for the new Holy
Family Master Plan (see Enclosure 2). Improvements to the Holy Family campus are proposed in
two phases. Phase 1, to occur by year 2020, includes:
      x   A new parking lot (44 stalls) which will double as an outdoor covered play area during
          school hours
      x   A new parking and preschool drop-off area at the north end of the property (10 stalls)
      x   A new maintenance/storage shed (2,214 sq. ft.)
      x   Standard street frontage improvements along 119th Avenue NE and NE 75th Street.
As a result of the parking lot expansions, on-site parking would total 246 spaces. Including the
overflow lot, the total increases to 276 spaces.
Phase 2 includes replacing the roof of the existing church and expanding the nave, the central
part of the church, to accommodate an additional 172 seats for a total of 758 seats. The building
addition would total 3,322 square feet and occur sometime between year 2020 and 2025.
Enclosure 2 contains the proposed Master Plan.
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The SEPA "threshold determination" is the formal decision as to whether the proposal is likely to
cause a significant adverse environmental impact for which mitigation cannot be identified.
Where City regulations have been adopted to address an environmental impact, it is presumed
that such regulations are adequate to achieve sufficient mitigation [WAC 197-11-660(1)(e) and
(g)]. Therefore, when requiring project mitigation based on adverse environmental impacts, the
City would first consider whether a regulation has been adopted for the purpose of mitigating the
environmental impact in question.

                                                                               Holy Family Master Plan
                                                                                 File No. SEP14-02342
                                                                                           Page 2 of 3


I have had an opportunity to visit the subject property and review the following documents:
   x   Enclosure 3: Environmental Checklist dated November 3, 2014
   x   Enclosure 4: Traffic and Parking Assessment Update Memo prepared by Transpo Group,
       dated April 7, 2015
   x   Enclosure 5: Addendum to Parking Analysis prepared by Transpo Group, dated December
       21, 2015
   x   Enclosure 6: Traffic and Parking Review Memo prepared by Thang Nguyen dated
       December 24, 2015.
Based on a review of these materials, the main environmental issues related to the project are
potential traffic and parking impacts.
The City received several emails and letters from the public during the comment period for the
master plan review (see Enclosure 7). Most of the concerns raised by the public were in regards
to traffic impacts and traffic safety in the area of the subject property. The early public feedback
provided information on probable adverse impacts and gave suggestions on how to reduce or
eliminate impacts. As a result, the City was able to review the comments prior to making a SEPA
determination. Many of the public comments resulted in additional analysis as provided in the
updated Traffic Impact Analysis submitted by the applicant’s transportation engineer (see
Enclosure 4).
  Thang Nguyen, Transportation Engineer with the City of Kirkland Public Works Department has
responded to the citizen concerns in his review memo (Enclosure 6). His review memo also
includes an analysis of the applicant’s Traffic Impact Analysis report and a list of mitigation
measures.
TRAFFIC IMPACTS
The Public Works Department has reviewed the Traffic Study for the proposed development (see
Enclosure 4) and concluded that the project will not have a significant adverse traffic impact on
existing facilities.
PARKING IMPACTS
The Public Works Department has reviewed the Parking Study for the proposed development (see
Enclosures 4 and 5) and recommended that the following mitigations be incorporated into the
proposal:
   x   Provide a minimum of three masses during the Christmas and Easter Sunday morning
       holidays in order to spread the decrease the peak parking demand for each mass.
   x   For an average Sunday with two masses, provide 330 parking spaces that consist of on-
       site and on-street parking along the project frontage:
   x   Provide 252 parking stalls on the main campus and 30 parking spaces on the off-site
       gravel lot on the east side of 120th Avenue NE.
   x   Redesign 119th Avenue NE to provide three on-street parking spaces.
   x   Redesign NE 75th Street to provide eight on-street parking stalls along the site frontage.
   x   Redesign and/or restripe the west side of 120th Avenue NE to provide 32 on-street parking
       spaces.
   x   The on-street parking should be recessed to maintain traffic flow in the travel lanes. The
       typical half-street frontage improvements will be required along those three streets that
       include curbs, gutters and sidewalks. The minimum travel lane width shall be 10 feet and
       the parking lane width shall be 8 feet on both 119th Avenue NE, 120th Avenue NE and
       NE 75th Street.
The applicant has agreed to the mitigations and has incorporated the mitigations into the master
plan proposal and related development plans (see Enclosure 2).

RECOMMENDATION
It will be necessary to further analyze certain aspects of the proposal to determine if the project
complies with all the applicable City codes and policies. That analysis is most appropriately
addressed with the master plan zoning permit review for the project. In contrast, State law
specifies that this environmental review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) is to
focus only on potential significant impacts to the environment that could not be adequately
mitigated through Kirkland regulations and the Comprehensive Plan.1
Based on my review of the submitted information, I have not identified any significant adverse
environmental impacts. Therefore, I recommend that a Determination of Non-Significance be
issued for this proposed action.

SEPA ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST

 Purpose of checklist:
Governmental agencies use this checklist to help determine whether the environmental impacts of your proposal are
significant. This information is also helpful to determine if available avoidance, minimization or compensatory
mitigation measures will address the probable significant impacts or if an environmental impact statement will be
prepared to further analyze the proposal.


    Instructions for applicants:

    This environmental checklist asks you to describe some basic information about your proposal. Please answer each
    question accurately and carefully, to the best of your knowledge. You may need to consult with an agency specialist
    or private consultant for some questions. You may use “not applicable” or "does not apply" only when you can
    explain why it does not apply and not when the answer is unknown. You may also attach or incorporate by
    reference additional studies reports. Complete and accurate answers to these questions often avoid delays with the
    SEPA process as well as later in the decision-making process.

    The checklist questions apply to all parts of your proposal, even if you plan to do them over a period of time or on
    different parcels of land. Attach any additional information that will help describe your proposal or its
    environmental effects. The agency to which you submit this checklist may ask you to explain your answers or
    provide additional information reasonably related to determining if there may be significant adverse impact.

    Instructions for Lead Agencies:
    Additional information may be necessary to evaluate the existing environment, all interrelated aspects of the proposal
    and an analysis of adverse impacts. The checklist is considered the first but not necessarily the only source of
    information needed to make an adequate threshold determination. Once a threshold determination is made, the lead
    agency is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the checklist and other supporting documents.

    Use of checklist for nonproject proposals:

    For nonproject proposals (such as ordinances, regulations, plans and programs), complete the applicable
    parts of sections A and B plus the SUPPLEMENTAL SHEET FOR NONPROJECT ACTIONS (part D). Please
    completely answer all questions that apply and note that the words "project," "applicant," and "property or
    site" should be read as "proposal," "proponent," and "affected geographic area," respectively. The lead
    agency may exclude (for non-projects) questions in Part B - Environmental Elements –that do not
    contribute meaningfully to the analysis of the proposal.

    5. Agency requesting checklist: City of Kirkland

    6. Proposed timing or schedule (including phasing, if applicable): Phase 1 – (described further at line 11)
    includes new parking lots, stormwater control devices, covered play structure, new maintenance/storage
    shed, and improvements to street frontage along 119th Avenue and 75th Street will occur within the next 5
    years. Phase 2 – which involves removing the roof of the existing church, and adding a new expansion to
    create a total of 600 seats, and a total of 3,322 SF new building area will occur within 5-10 years.

    7. Do you have any plans for future additions, expansion, or further activity related to or connected with this
    proposal? If yes, explain. Only Phase 2 described in line 6.


    8. List any environmental information you know about that has been prepared, or will be prepared,
    directly related to this proposal. Traffic and Parking Assessment prepared by Transpo Group dated
    11/14/14.

    9. Do you know whether applications are pending for governmental approvals of other proposals directly
    affecting the property covered by your proposal? If yes, explain. We are not aware of any applications
    pending for government approvals or other proposals directly affecting the property covered by this
    proposal.


    10. List any government approvals or permits that will be needed for your proposal, if known. SEPA
    threshold determination, City of Kirkland Zoning Permit, Building Permits, Right-of-Way use permits,
    Water, Sewer and Storm connection permits.


    11. Give brief, complete description of your proposal, including the proposed uses and the size of the
    project and site. There are several questions later in this checklist that ask you to describe certain
    aspects of your proposal. You do not need to repeat those answers on this page. (Lead agencies may
    modify this form to include additional specific information on project description.) The project overall
    goal are phased. Phase One aims to create an overflow parking lot that will act as play area during
    the school week. Half of this lot would be covered by a roof structure to allow “rainy day” outdoor
    activities. Also the north end of the parcel would be developed with new day care parking and drop off
    areas. A new combined storage and maintenance shed would be added adjacent to 75th Street – this
    building would replace (3) existing sheds that would be demolished to accommodate the new parking
    lot. Street frontage along 119th Avenue would be developed per City of Kirkland public works
    standards. The overall site area is 376,054 SF. Total new parking and drop off areas are 15,720 SF
    which create 55 new parking stalls. Total new covered play area is 8000 SF. The new 2,275 SF
    shed would replace an equal amount of area, giving a net new building area of zero. Phase two will
    expand the existing church to allow 331 new seats in the Nave. Due to a decreasing number of
    priests, it is expected that mass sizes will get larger due to the inability to hold multiple mass times
    over the weekend. Overall attendance would remain the same, with a higher concentration of
    parishioners at fewer masses. Phase two would add 3,322 SF new building area to the campus.

    12. Location of the proposal. Give sufficient information for a person to understand the precise location
    of your proposed project, including a street address, if any, and section, township, and range, if known. If
    a proposal would occur over a range of area, provide the range or boundaries of the site(s). Provide a
    legal description, site plan, vicinity map, and topographic map, if reasonably available. While you should
    submit any plans required by the agency, you are not required to duplicate maps or detailed plans
    submitted with any permit applications related to this checklist. City of Kirkland Parcel 092505-9018.

MEMORANDUM
Date:           April 7, 2015                                                         TG:       10034.01
To:             Thang Nguyen – City of Kirkland
From:           Stefanie Herzstein, PE, PTOE
Subject:        Holy Family Parish Master Plan – Traffic and Parking Assessment Update

This memorandum summarizes the traffic and parking assessment for the proposed Holy Family
Parish Master Plan located at 7045 120th Avenue NE in Kirkland, Washington. This serves as a
revised analysis based on feedback from the City of Kirkland including a revised description of the
church use.


Study Scope
As documented in the Holy Family Church Expansion Traffic Concurrency Test Notice, Tran14-
00502 dated August 4, 2014 the proposed project would not generate additional weekday AM or
PM peak hour trips (see Attachment A). Based on coordination with the City of Kirkland Public
Works and the City’s Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines, August 2014, there are no significant
intersections or off-site intersection that would require analysis. This assessment does provide an
evaluation of the site access driveways, key off-site intersections adjacent to the site and an
evaluation of parking as coordinated by City staff.


Project Description
Holy Family Parish is a Catholic church that
provides worship services, education (preschool
through eighth grade), and fellowship to the
Kirkland community. The site is located at 7045
120th Avenue NE, which is south of NE 75th
Street, north of NE 70th Street, and west of 120th
Avenue NE (see Figure 1).

The proposed master plan is consistent with the
previously approved master plan and is primarily
intended to provide additional amenities for the
current Parish. This would be to maintain existing
members and is not anticipated to result in an
increase in Parish members. The master plan
includes:
            Storage and Maintenance
             Building: Demolition of the existing
             shed, and construction of a new
             building for maintenance storage and
             St. Vincent de Paul Society storage
             to accommodate distribution of
             donated household items, clothing,
             and food.
            Additional Parking: Provide 10
             additional parking spaces at the

                                                                      Figure 1. Site Vicinity

                                                                                                            Attachment 7




              north end of the site west of the preschool/youth center building to be used during
              drop-off and pick-up for the preschool. The new parking would be accessed off of a
              new driveway along 119th Avenue NE and the existing driveway off of NE 75th Street.
              Currently, drop-off/pick-up parking for the preschool is occurring on-street along 120th
              Avenue NE. The new parking would allow parents to park in the lot during these times
              instead of on-street. In addition, a new overflow parking area would be created north
              of the Parish Education Center with 43 parking stalls. 7 spaces would be removed
              with the project resulting in a total of 46 net new parking stalls on-site. The new
              driveway to the overflow parking lot would results in a fourth leg to the intersection of
              119th Avenue NE and NE 74th Street.
             Playfields and Playground: Create two micro playfields for use by the existing
              school and youth center activities on-site south of the Youth Center and north of the
              existing Parish Education Center. Create a new covered asphalt playground north of
              the Parish Education Center, which can be used as overflow parking as needed.
             Parish Education Center Entry: Reconfigure the 119th Avenue NE school access to
              the parking lot and provide frontage improvements.
             Expansion: Expand the devotional chapel and expand the existing Church from 586
                                                     1
              to 758 seats (an addition of 172 seats) . The total expansion would be 3,322 square-
              feet.

On-site parking for the proposed Master Plan would total 245 parking spaces (202 general spaces
and 43 spaces in the new overflow parking lot). In addition, there is an existing overflow gravel lot
located along 120th Avenue NE south of the Parish Center that provides approximately 30
additional spaces for a total of 276 parking spaces for the site.

Access to the site would be via three driveways along 119th Avenue NE (two new and one
existing), two existing driveways along 120th Avenue NE, and one existing driveway along NE
75th Street. Figure 2 provides an illustration for the master plan showing the driveway and parking
locations.

The Master Plan would be constructed in two phases with Phase 1 occurring within five years or
by 2019 and Phase 2 occurring within ten years or by 2024. Phase 1 includes the storage and
maintenance building, additional parking, playfields, playground, and Parish Education Center
entry reconfiguration. Phase 2 includes expansion of the devotional chapel and Church. This
expansion is being proposed to accommodate higher attendance levels and allow for the number
of services per day to be reduced.


Trip Generation
No changes in trip generation would occur as a result of Phase 1 as the proposal includes
ancillary uses that would not impact the volume of traffic coming to or from the site. For Phase 2,
the expansion of the church would accommodate the existing parishioners with fewer services
and major gatherings on Sundays. This would not result in an increase in the number of overall
parishioners or activities; therefore, the overall daily traffic on Sunday is not anticipated to change
with Phase 2; however, the Sunday peak hour trip generation would increase given that the
number of services held would be reduced and a greater number of people would attend a single
Mass. The following describes the existing and proposed Master Plan trip generation. Data and
existing characteristics of the site as well as the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual 9th Edition were reviewed to estimate future increases in trip generation.

Weekday
As described above, weekday trip generation is not anticipated to increase as a result of the
proposed project since the total number of parishioners and weekday activities would not change.
Based on coordination with City staff, as a conservative estimate of potential impacts, the ITE Trip
Generation Manual, 9th Edition was used to estimate the potential for additional trips. ITE church
(#560) trip rates were applied to the gross floor area of the expansion to project weekday trips. 0
provides a summary of the estimated weekday trip generation for the expansion. As shown in the
table, the proposed expansion could generate approximately 30 trips on a weekday with 2 trips
during the AM peak hour and 2 trips during the PM peak hour. Master Plan.

Sunday
Daily traffic on Sunday would not change with the proposed Master Plan since the number of
parishioners would stay the same. The reduction in the number of services would result in a
greater number of people attending a single Mass, which would increase the Sunday peak hour
trip generation. Sunday peak hour trip generation for the church was estimated based on the
existing site characteristics described below.

Existing
A trip generation study was performed in March 2014 to estimate trip rates of the current facility for
use in forecasting future traffic generation with the proposed expansion. This included collecting
data on a Sunday to estimate existing site traffic volumes during services. Attachment B provides
the Sunday traffic count data. Table 2 provides a summary of the existing traffic volumes and trip
rates for the site. As shown in the table, the site currently generates approximately 1,840 Sunday
trips occurring with a peak hour trip generation of 368 trips. Compared to the ITE Trip Generation
Manual, 9th Edition trip rates for church, the Sunday trip rates estimated from the March 2014 data
collection are higher than the published average ITE rates.

Proposed Master Plan
Traffic generated by the proposed Master Plan for the Sunday peak hour was estimated based on
the volume of existing traffic as compared to the number of seats. Phase 1 of the Master Plan is
intended to accommodate existing on-site functions and would not increase the size of the church.
Phase 2 would result in 172 additional church seats for a total of 758 seats. As described above,
the increase in seats would result in a higher attendance at Mass and increase the Sunday peak
hour trip generation. Overall trip generation on a Sunday is not anticipated to increase because
the church would not be increasing the number of parishioners or activities. Table 3 summarizes
the Sunday trip generation for the site. As shown in the table, the proposed project would generate
an additional 110 trips during the Sunday peak hour due to the reduction in number of services.
This is an increase in trips of approximately 30 percent during the Sunday peak hour.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
Trip distribution patterns for the proposed project were based on existing travel patterns for the
church and adjacent street traffic and the location of the existing and proposed parking areas. The
trip distribution on the weekday is not expected to change. On Sunday, the trip distribution would
adjust based on the location of the additional parking. The resulting distribution patterns for the
weekday and Sunday are shown on Figures 3 and 4. Project trips were assigned to the driveways
and roadway network as shown on Figure 4.


Site Access and Off-Site Intersection Evaluation
Traffic safety, volumes, operations, sight distance, and driveway spacing were evaluated for the
proposal. Sight distance and driveway spacing were evaluated for the two new driveways only
since the proposal does not include any changes to the configuration of the existing access points.
The evaluation of site access volumes and operations focuses on Phase 2 during the weekday
school peak hour (7:30 to 8:30 a.m.) and Sunday peak hour (10:15 to 11:15 a.m.) when site traffic
generation would be highest.

Traffic safety, volumes, and operations (including service levels and queues) were also evaluated
at four off-site intersections that provide direct access to the campus. Weekday and Sunday peak
hours are evaluated consistent with the driveway analysis. The off-site intersections evaluated
include:
                    119th Avenue NE/NE 75th Street
                    120th Avenue NE/NE 75th Street

Traffic Safety
Collision data for the most recent three-year period for roadways and intersections surrounding the
site including at the site driveways was provided by WSDOT. The data was reviewed between
January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. The collision history shows that no collisions were
reported at any of the existing intersections or driveways along the site frontage. There were a few
collisions observed along the NE 70th Street roadway segment between 119th Avenue NE and
120th Avenue NE south of the site. Two collisions occurred in 2011 and three in 2012, with none
in 2013. The majority of the collisions were rear-end and were related to driver inattention and
following too closely. The proposed project would not add any new traffic to this intersection.
Traffic Volumes
Weekday school and Sunday peak hour traffic volumes were collected in September 2014 and
March 2015 during the weekday (when school was in normal session) and Sunday peak periods.
Future (2024) driveway forecasts for Phase 2 were determined by applying a 2 percent per year
growth rate to existing traffic volumes. Pipeline Project trips were provided by the City of Kirkland;
however, there are no pipeline projects that with traffic that would impact the site driveways.
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate traffic volumes at the proposed Master Plan site access points for
existing and Phase 2 conditions. The existing intersection turning movement counts are provided
in Attachment C.
Traffic Operations
Based on the traffic volumes, weekday school and Sunday peak hour traffic operations for existing
and Phase 2 conditions were evaluated at the site access driveways and four off-site study
intersections. The intersection operation level of service (LOS) analysis method was based on
procedures identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (2010), and evaluated using Synchro
version 8.0. Traffic operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of
levels of service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating
extreme congestion and long vehicle delays.

All of the driveways and off-site study intersections are side-street stop controlled except the 120th
Avenue NE/NE 70th Street intersection, which is all-way stop controlled. All-way stop controlled
intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted average control delay of the overall
intersection. Side-street stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the average control
delay for each minor-street movement (or shared movement) as well as major-street left-turns.
This approach is used because major-street through vehicles are assumed to experience zero
delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall average delay, and this
calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 4 summarizes the
existing, without-Phase 2, and with-Phase 2 weekday and Sunday peak hour LOS at the study
intersections. The detailed LOS worksheets are included in Attachment D.
