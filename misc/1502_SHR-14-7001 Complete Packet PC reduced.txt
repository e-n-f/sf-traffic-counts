Staff Report – February 2, 2015
Shoreline Management
Following the criteria set forth in Chapter II of the City of Walla Walla Shoreline Master Program
(SMP), adopted February 26, 1986, the subject property is determined to have environmental
designation of “Urban Environment.” The proposed project meets the definition for ‘Commercial
Development’ in the SMP under Chapter IV, Section 3, Use Activities.

Land Use and Zoning
The Walla Walla Urban Area Comprehensive Plan land use designation is Downtown and the
current zoning is Central Commercial (CC). Adjacent land uses are predominately commercial and
the Heritage Park adjacent to Mill Creek. There will be no conflict with surrounding land uses or
requirements of the Municipal Code.

Site Characteristics
The subject site is the existing building, indoor swimming pool addition and parking area. The
subject property is approximately 34,200 sq ft.

SITE PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE (SPRC) REVIEW
On December 4, 2014, the City of Walla Walla Site Plan Review Committee (SPRC) met with the
applicant, reviewed the proposed project and corresponding request for the shoreline permit. The
SPRC findings and comments are contained within the summary letter, dated December 12, 2014,
which is included as an attachment to this staff report.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The applicant prepared a State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) Environmental Checklist. The City
of Walla Walla SEPA Responsible Official, Director Elizabeth Chamberlain, issued a final SEPA
threshold Determination of Non Significance (DNS) on January 7, 2015. A Determination of
Consistency was issued concurrently with the DNS.

PUBLIC NOTICE
A notice of application and a notice of public hearing were issued on this proposal as required by
WWMC Chapter 20.14. No general public comments were received. The Department of Ecology
comment letter is attached to the staff report.

WASHINGTON STATE SHORELINE MANAGEMENT ACT( SMA)
Under the SMA, local governments have the primary responsibility for initiating the planning
program and administering the regulatory requirements of the Act with the Department of Ecology
acting in a supportive and review capacity. Under the SMA, it is the responsibility of local
governments to administer shoreline-permitting systems for proposed substantial development in
shorelines and to develop master programs to provide an objective guide for regulating the use of
shorelines. As part of the planning process, local governments are tasked with identifying
reasonable and appropriate uses to permit in shorelines. The legislature provided in RCW
90.58.020 the following order of preference for permitted uses.
             1. Recognize and protect the statewide interest over local interest;


28 South Spokane Street – Shoreline Permit (SHR-14-7001)                                    Page 2/7
Staff Report – February 2, 2015
           2.   Preserve the natural character of the shoreline;
           3.   Result in long term over short-term benefit;
           4.   Protect the resources and ecology of the shoreline;
           5.   Increase public access to publicly owned areas of the shoreline;
           6.   Increase recreational opportunities for the public in the shoreline;
           7.   Provide for any other element as defined in RCW 90.58.100 deemed appropriate or
                necessary.

RCW 90.58.020 also requires that “permitted uses in the shorelines of the state shall be designed
and conducted in a manner to minimize, insofar as practical, any resultant damage to the ecology
and environment of the shoreline area and interference with the public’s use of the water.”
Within this legislative framework, the City of Walla Walla has adopted a Shoreline Master Program,
which identifies goals and policies for development within shorelines of the state and identifies
permitted uses for each shoreline environment.

It is opinion of staff that if the project is developed in accordance with the goals, policies, and
regulations of the City of Walla Walla Shoreline Master Program that the legislative intent of the
Shoreline Management Act will have been satisfied.

CITY OF WALLA WALLA SHORELINE MASTER PROGRAM
Staff has reviewed the proposal against the goals, policies, and regulations of the City of Walla Walla
Shoreline Master Program and provides the following analysis.

Chapter III: Goals for Walla Walla City Shorelines
It is the opinion of staff that the proposed development would be generally consistent with the
following goals.
       Economic Development – Have economic development on shorelines of the City of Walla Walla
       be consistent with good planning and wise resource use.
       ANALYSIS: The proposal will have to comply with City of Walla Walla development
       standards including landscaping/screening requirements, Downtown Design Standards,
       dimensional standards, etc. This will ensure that the development is consistent with good
       planning.
       Public Access – have public access addressed as an important element in all actions
       contemplating use of public shorelines and; to open up private shorelines to public use to
       whatever extent is possible without usurping the landowner’s right to limit access as he sees
       fit.
       ANALYSIS: Given the characteristics of the site and the shoreline in this area it is not
       practical to provide additional public access to the shoreline from this site. The adjacent
       Spokane Street bridge and Heritage Park provides a view of Mill Creek.

       Circulation –encourage a transportation network in the City of Walla Walla which is capable
       of delivering people, goods and services and which will result in minimum disruption of the
       natural system of the shorelines.



28 South Spokane Street – Shoreline Permit (SHR-14-7001)                                      Page 3/7
Staff Report – February 2, 2015
        ANALYSIS: Access to the site will be via Spokane Street and the bridge. All new pedestrian
        facilities will occur on the subject property or within the existing road right-of-way; there
        will be no impact to the “natural system of the shorelines.”

        Shoreline Use – have shoreline uses (including, but not limited to housing, commerce, industry,
        transportation, public facilities, recreation, agriculture, education, and natural resources)
        occur in such a manner as to be mutually compatible and to cause the least possible
        environmental damage.
        ANALYSIS: The proposed use is generally compatible with the other existing and proposed
        uses in the area. It is not expected that the proposal would result in any environmental
        damage as the applicant will have to comply with all applicable local, state and federal
        regulations.
        Conservation – provide for certain shoreline areas being protected from encroachment by
        incompatible uses and used in such a manner as will not upset the ecological balance of such
        areas.
        ANALYSIS: Due to the confined concrete levee channel, there are no unique site features
        warranting conservation measures.
        Historical/Cultural – protect those areas of the City shorelines that have outstanding historic,
        cultural, educational, and scientific value.
        ANALYSIS: There are no known historical/cultural areas located on site. In the event
        historical or cultural artifacts are uncovered during development, appropriate steps should
        be taken to evaluate their significance and preserve them to the extent feasible.
        Reclamation – have shoreline areas which are blighted by abandoned and dilapidated
        structures returned to a natural, useful condition.
        ANALYSIS: No abandoned structures on site.

Chapter IV: Policies for Shoreline Use Activities
As described above, the proposed activity is classified as “commercial development” in the Walla
SMP; the SMP provides the following policies for shoreline protection.

Commercial Development – promote the development of water oriented commercial development
within certain shoreline designations, consistent with City zoning and in such a manner as to cause
a minimal amount of environmental disruption.
   1. Priority should be given to those commercial developments which are particularly
        dependent on being close to water bodies.
   2. Parking facilities should be placed inland from the structure or activity they serve.
   3. Commercial structures should not interfere with visual access to scenic vistas.

ANALYSIS: The proposed placement meets these standards. Although the proposed commercial
development is not water oriented or dependent, it does meet these policies. The site has the
existing building and the proposed development will not interfere with the view of any scenic vista
related to the Mill Creek shoreline. Staff supports the proposed site design and believes it
consistent with the intent of the shoreline policies, while balancing efficient use of the property for
commercial development as provided for in the Municipal Code.

Staff Report – February 2, 2015
Chapter V, Regulations
As stated previously, commercial development not specifically “water dependent” or “water
oriented” is not addressed in the SMP or identified as a permitted use. The SMP provides in
Chapter V, Section 10 that “uses which are not classified or set forth in [the SMP] may be authorized
as conditional uses” and outlines the criteria listed below. Staff has provided analysis on each
criterion.
   a. That the proposed use will be consistent with the policies of the City of Walla Walla
      Shoreline Master Program and RCW 90.58.020.
      ANALYSIS: An evaluation of the proposal against these policies has been provided earlier in
      this report. It is the opinion of staff that this proposal is consistent with these policies.
   b. That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines.
      ANALYSIS: There is currently no provision for public use of the shoreline on this site.
   c. That the proposed use of the site and design of the project will be compatible with other
      permitted uses within the area.
      ANALYSIS: Other uses in the surrounding area are commercial. The surrounding
      properties are commercially zoned; the proposed use of the site is fully consistent with the
      intent of the City’s Central Commercial zoning district.
   d. That the proposed use will cause no unreasonably adverse effects to the shoreline
      environment designation in which it is to be located.
      ANALYSIS: The shoreline environment designation for the subject site is Urban.
      Commercial uses are allowed in this shoreline environment. Provided the site is developed
      consistent with applicable regulations, it is anticipated that the proposal will be consistent
      with the Urban Environment and that no adverse impacts are likely.
   e. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.
      ANALYSIS: The Applicant will have to comply with applicable standards and policies which
      will ensure that there is no substantial detrimental effect on the public interest.

The SMP requires that in addition to the criteria in Chapter V, Section 10 (above), the applicant
must also demonstrate that “extraordinary circumstances preclude reasonable use of the property
in a manner consistent with the use regulations of this master program.” The use regulations of the
SMP give priority to commercial development that is “water-dependent” or “water-oriented.” Mill
Creek in this location, and throughout most of Walla Walla, is channelized and the shoreline is
characterized by commercial development. The City zoning in this area is Central Commercial,
which allows for the proposed use. It is the opinion of staff that these factors meet the threshold for
“extraordinary circumstances.”

FINDINGS
Staff review of the application for shoreline substantial development permit resulted in the
following findings.
    1. That portion of Mill Creek fronting the subject parcel is subject to the provisions of the City
        of Walla Walla’s Shoreline Management Master Program, and has been designated the
        “Urban Environment” classification.
    2. The subject parcel is located within 200 feet of the ordinary high watermark for Mill Creek.
    3. A Notice of Application was published in the Walla Walla Union Bulletin on November 7 and
        November 14 with a 30-day comment period which ended on December 15, 2014.
    4. The City of Walla Walla SEPA Responsible Official issued a DNS on January 7, 2015.

Staff Report – February 2, 2015
   5. The proposed project can be found to be generally consistent with the legislative findings
       and intent statements set forth in RCW 90.58.020, and the goals, policies and regulations set
       forth in the City of Walla Walla Shoreline Master Program.
   6. It is anticipated if the project is developed in accordance with the recommended conditions
       of the shoreline permit approval, the statewide interest will be protected.
   7. No work will occur within the floodway of Mill Creek. Mill Creek is within the concrete
       channel and the upland areas has been developed with Commercial and Public uses.
   8. Recreational opportunities non-existent within this section of the shoreline because the
       channel is closed to public access. The proposal will not further limit public use. Heritage
       Park is located across Mill Creek.
   9. The application was reviewed by the City of Walla Walla SPRC for compliance with
       applicable City standards, regulations, policies, and goals. The SPRC provided a summary of
       their review in a letter, dated December 12, 2014.
   10. A notice of public hearing was posted on-site, published in the Walla Walla Union Bulletin,
       mailed to property owners within 400 feet and parties of record, and posted on the City of
       Walla Walla website.

RE:    Narrative Statement
       Shoreline Substantial Development Permit Application
       Historic YMCA Building Adaptive Re-Use
       28 South Spokane Street Historic Hotel Project (“Project”)


Dear Ms. Prentice:

First, thank you for your assistance with the shoreline permit process and our preliminary
planning and zoning inquiries regarding the above referenced Project.

The following narrative accompanies the attached Application for Substantial
Development Permit for the Project.

1. Intended starting and completion dates: Construction is tentatively
scheduled to commence late spring 2016, followed by (approximate) 14 month
construction period.

2. Reasons this project requires a shoreline application: The focus of this project is the
adaptive re-use and expansion of a historic structure that was built in 1907 adjacent to the
Mill Creek Waterway, necessitating a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit
Application.



            1326 Fifth Avenue     Suite 654   Seattle, Washington 98101
          Tel and fax 206.625.1511 e-mail Stephen@stephendayarchitecture.com
                            www.StephenDayArchitecture.com
Page 2



3. Nearby Uses. Adjacent uses to the north are commercial uses and service uses,
including retail, the Mill Creek Waterway and public uses. Adjacent uses to the south
include retail, restaurant, with some institutional and public uses. Adjacent uses to the
east and west are retail, service, with other commercial and light industrial. Residential
uses in the general vicinity are scattered and none are adjacent or located near enough to
the subject property to be directly or adversely impacted by the Project.

4. Conditional Use Analysis.

A. Water Enjoyment Uses. The Walla Walla master program (“SMP”) allows for
"water oriented uses" through a conditional use permit in the Urban environment. Water
oriented uses include "Water-enjoyment uses" and "Water-related uses" (see definitions
below).

In the proposed project, new hotel and restaurant/bar uses located in the shoreline area on
this historic site and fronting on Mill Creek could be seen as combination of "Water-
oriented" uses - because in this location they can be seen as "water-enjoyment" uses.

The proposed plan includes a portion of the hotel guest rooms and a restaurant that face
Mill Creek with a terrace overlooking the creek, plus an addition with mixed
hotel/food/beverage/retail use. These mixed uses all provide the financial feasibility and
support for the substantial rehabilitation of the historic building and creation of these
water-enjoyment uses.

From the WAC definitions regarding "water-oriented" and "water-enjoyment" uses
(WAC 173-26-020 Definitions):

"...(40) "Water-enjoyment use" means a recreational use or other use that facilitates
public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use; or a use that provides
for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of
people as a general characteristic of the use and which through location, design, and
operation ensures the public's ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the
shoreline. In order to qualify as a water-enjoyment use, the use must be open to the
general public and the shoreline-oriented space within the project must be devoted to the
specific aspects of the use that fosters shoreline enjoyment.

  (41) "Water-oriented use" means a use that is water-dependent, water-related, or
water-enjoyment, or a combination of such uses....


B. Other Uses. Alternatively, for uses that are not deemed to be “water-oriented” uses per
se, there is also a separate conditional use permit possibility for approving such uses in the
shoreline area. The SMP provides in Chapter V, Section 10 that “uses which are not
Page 3



classified or set forth in [the SMP] may be authorized as conditional uses…” and outlines
the criteria listed below.

Conditional Use Criteria:

a. That the proposed use will be consistent with the policies of the City of Walla
Walla Shoreline Master Program and RCW 90.58.020.

Reviewing the proposal against the goals, policies, and regulations of the City of Walla
Walla Shoreline Master Program:

Chapter III: Goals for Walla Walla City Shorelines
We believe the proposed development would support and be consistent with all of the
following goals:

“Goal: Economic Development – have economic development on shorelines of the City
of Walla Walla be consistent with good planning and wise resource use.”

The proposal will be required to comply with City of Walla Walla development
Standards, including landscaping/screening requirements, storm water regulations,
dimensional standards, etc. This will ensure that the development is consistent with good
Planning and wise resource use.

“Goal: Public Access – have public access addressed as an important element in all
actions contemplating use of public shorelines and; to open up private shorelines to
public use to whatever extent is possible without usurping the landowner’s right to limit
access as he sees fit.”

The current state of the subject property includes a vacant and deteriorating building with
no safe water enjoyment possibilities. The Project features a substantial historic
rehabilitation of this 1907 building fronting on Mill Creek, with a new restaurant terrace
overlooking the waterway, creating enhanced possibilities for water enjoyment of the
Mill Creek Waterway, as noted on the Site Plan at drawing SP-02 and the Height/Use
Diagram at SP-03.

“Goal: Circulation – encourage a transportation network in the City of Walla Walla
which is capable of delivering people, goods and services and which will result in
minimum disruption of the natural system of the shorelines.”

Access to the site will be via existing public roads. A service alley also abuts and serves
the site. The historic building and new addition will front directly on the public sidewalk
in S. Spokane Street. Public transit is located within one block in either direction. The
applicant has proposed to develop pedestrian facilities on site, with restaurant terrace
Page 4



access adjacent to the Mill Creek channel and to provide pedestrian connectivity to the
building. These new pedestrian facilities will not disrupt the Mill Creek shoreline.

“Goal: Shoreline Use – Have shoreline uses (including, but not limited to housing,
commerce, industry, transportation, public facilities, recreation, agriculture, education,
and natural resources) occur in such a manner as to be mutually compatible and to cause
the least possible environmental damage.”

The proposed use is on a site that has been developed since 1907. The proposed uses are
compatible with the other existing and zoned uses in the area. It is not expected that the
proposal would result in any environmental damage as the Project will have to comply
with all applicable local, state and federal regulations.

“Goal: Conservation – Provide for certain shoreline areas being protected from
encroachment by incompatible uses and used in such a manner as will not upset the
ecological balance of such areas.

The existing historic structure was built adjacent to the Mill Creek Waterway in 1907.
The proposed Project does not increase incompatible encroachments. The Project
proposal includes a restaurant terrace between the historic structure and Mill Creek to
enhance water enjoyment. Due to the currently developed state of the site and the
confined concrete levee channel in the Mill Creek Waterway, there are no unique site
features warranting ecological conservation measures.

“Historical/Cultural – Protect those areas of the City shorelines that have outstanding
historic, cultural, educational, and scientific value.”

The subject property includes a culturally-significant and historic 1907 YMCA building,
now in an altered and deteriorating condition. Simultaneously with the shoreline permit
application process for the Project, the applicant is engaged in the process of listing the
1907 building on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The proposed Project
features the adaptive re-use of the 1907 structure, in accordance with the U.S. Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. The applicant’s projects typically focus on
the protection of and adaptive re-use of significant historic properties and that is a central
reason for undertaking this project. The new addition will involve the removal of an
unsympathetic and non-compatible addition that has obscured the historic building’s
south façade, the restoration of the building’s original cornice and entablature, historic
masonry and wood window repair and rehabilitation, a new addition that is substantial
but largely set back from the south façade, creating economic development that will
support the historic adaptive re-use Project, all in accordance with the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. As a result, a highly significant part of the history
of Walla Walla will be retained, protected and given a new purpose.
Page 5



“Reclamation – have shoreline areas which are blighted by abandoned and dilapidated
structures returned to a natural, useful condition.

Please see narrative above regarding “Historical/Cultural”. This Project involves
rehabilitation and adaptive re-use of historical and cultural property, but it does not
involve reclamation of land from abandoned structures.

b. That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public
shorelines.

There is currently no provision for public use of the shoreline on this site, due to
the Mill Creek channel. The proposed adaptive re-use would enhance the possibilities for
enjoyment of the Mill Creek Waterway.

c. That the proposed use of the site and design of the project will be compatible with
other permitted uses within the area.

Other uses in this area are almost exclusively commercial and institutional. The Project
site is zoned Central Commercial and classified as an “Urban” environment under the
SMP. The subject property is surrounded by other similarly-zoned parcels. The proposal
will not significantly change the nature of the surrounding area. Adjacent nearby
properties located to the south, north, east and west involve commercial and industrial
uses.

d. That the proposed use will cause no unreasonably adverse effects to the shoreline
environment designation in which it is to be located.

The shoreline environment designation for the subject site is Urban. Other commercial
uses are allowed in this shoreline environment. The site will be developed consistent
with applicable regulations, the proposal will be consistent with the Urban Environment
and no adverse effects to this Urban Environment will result from the proposed Project.

e. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.

The Project must and will comply with applicable standards and policies which will
ensure that there is no substantial detrimental effect on the public interest. As described
above, the public interest will be respected and supported by the proposed Project.

The SMP further requires that in addition to the criteria in Chapter V, Section 10 (above),
the applicant must also demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances preclude reasonable
use of the property in a manner consistent with the use regulations of this master
program.” The use regulations of the SMP give priority to commercial development that
is “water‐dependent” or “water‐oriented.” Mill Creek in this location, and throughout
Page 6



most of Walla Walla, is channelized and the shoreline is characterized by commercial
development. This site, specifically, is already zoned Central Commercial and is
developed with a long-vacant, substantial historic structure. The historic building itself is
a cultural resource that is deteriorating rapidly and that will required significant economic
investment on this site to support a substantial historic rehabilitation of the existing
building. We believe that these factors clearly meet the threshold for “extraordinary
circumstances.”

Thank you again for your assistance and information and please do not hesitate to contact
me with any questions or comments concerning the proposed Project or the shoreline
permit.

                                                UPDATED   2014
Purpose of checklist:
Governmental agencies use this checklist to help determine whether the environmental impacts of your
proposal are significant. This information is also helpful to determine if available avoidance, minimization
or compensatory mitigation measures will address the probable significant impacts or if an environmental
impact statement will be prepared to further analyze the proposal.

Instructions for applicants: [help]
This environmental checklist asks you to describe some basic information about your proposal. Please
answer each question accurately and carefully, to the best of your knowledge. You may need to consult
with an agency specialist or private consultant for some questions. You may use “not applicable” or
"does not apply" only when you can explain why it does not apply and not when the answer is unknown.
You may also attach or incorporate by reference additional studies reports. Complete and accurate
answers to these questions often avoid delays with the SEPA process as well as later in the decision-
making process.

The checklist questions apply to all parts of your proposal, even if you plan to do them over a period of
time or on different parcels of land. Attach any additional information that will help describe your proposal
or its environmental effects. The agency to which you submit this checklist may ask you to explain your
answers or provide additional information reasonably related to determining if there may be significant
adverse impact.

Instructions for Lead Agencies:
Please adjust the format of this template as needed. Additional information may be necessary to
evaluate the existing environment, all interrelated aspects of the proposal and an analysis of adverse
impacts. The checklist is considered the first but not necessarily the only source of information needed to
make an adequate threshold determination. Once a threshold determination is made, the lead agency is
responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the checklist and other supporting documents.

Use of checklist for nonproject proposals: [help]
For nonproject proposals (such as ordinances, regulations, plans and programs), complete the applicable
parts of sections A and B plus the SUPPLEMENTAL SHEET FOR NONPROJECT ACTIONS (part D). Please
completely answer all questions that apply and note that the words "project," "applicant," and "property or
site" should be read as "proposal," "proponent," and "affected geographic area," respectively. The lead
agency may exclude (for non-projects) questions in Part B - Environmental Elements –that do not
contribute meaningfully to the analysis of the proposal.

Subject:            Walla Walla Hotel – Trip Generation Analysis

Transpo Group has been retained to assist the project team in identifying the potential impacts
associated with the proposed re-purposing of the building located at 28 South Spokane Street in
Walla Walla, Washington. It is our understanding that this building was originally constructed in
1907 and was used in part as a YMCA and other office/commercial uses. This memorandum
provides a summary of the weekday trip generation for the project; including weekday daily, AM
and PM peak hour periods. The scope of this initial analysis is intended to support the shoreline
permit application.

The proposed project includes the re-purposing of the existing building to include a hotel use and
associated amenities. The general site plan is included below in Figure 1. The development
program includes the following elements:
            Hotel with 70 rooms
            Restaurant with approximately 1,500 sf seating area
            Meeting space totaling approximately 1,500 sf
            Retail/wine tasting space (integrated into hotel) totaling approximately 5,000sf

          11730 118th Avenue N.E., Suite 600, Kirkland, WA 98034   |   425.821.3665   |
All uses identified in the list are ancillary to the hotel and intended to primarily serve the residents
of the hotel.

No parking is proposed for the site. Parking for hotel users will be accommodated via valet
parking. The hotel operator will be working with adjacent uses that have underutilized parking to
serve the needs of the hotel. The hotel guest and visitor drop-off area will be located off of S
Spokane Street. The hotel will also be operating a shuttle to/from the airport, further reducing the
need for guests to utilize cars and reducing the overall parking and trip generation impacts of the
project.

Trip Generation Estimates
Trip generation estimates for the project were prepared utilizing standard rates published in the
ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition for the hotel land use. The additional project elements
and hotel amenities described previously in this memo are noted in the land use description for a
hotel. As such the trip generation is based on the number of hotel rooms, as the trips associated
with the other amenities are included in the calculation of the rate.

Subject:            Walla Walla Hotel – Traffic Impact Analysis

This memorandum documents the traffic impact analysis prepared for the proposed hotel located
at 28 South Spokane Street in Walla Walla. The scope of this analysis is based on coordination
with City staff. The following sections describe the proposed project and summarize potential
traffic-related impacts of the project. The scope of this analysis includes a characterization of the
existing roadway network, an estimate of the project’s anticipated trip generation, and an analysis
of traffic operations at the adjacent intersections for existing, future without, and future with project
conditions. The two study intersections identified through coordination with city staff include E
Main Street/S Spokane Street and E Alder Street/S Spokane Street.


Project Description
The proposed project is located at 28 S Spokane Street between E Main and E Alder streets.
Figure 1 illustrates the project site and the surrounding vicinity. The proposed project would re-
purpose the building, which was originally constructed in 1907 and was used in part as a YMCA
and other office/commercial uses. The proposed project includes converting the building to provide
a hotel use and associated amenities. The development program includes the following elements:
      •      70-Room Hotel
      •      1,500 square-foot Restaurant
      •      1,500 square-foot Meeting Space
      •      5,000 square-foot Retail/wine tasting
             (integrated with the hotel)


Access to the site would be via S Spokane
Street. Primary parking for the hotel use
would be provided through a combination of
off-site facilities and valet parking. The
potential parking facilities (see Figure 1) are
located to the west and north of the site and
have 33 spaces in Parking Lot A and 65
spaces in Parking Lot B. A preliminary site
plan is shown on Figure 2. The project is
anticipated to be occupied by 2017.




                                                                           Figure 1 - Site Vicinity

Based on a a review of both the WSDOT Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP)
and the Walla Walla Capital Improvements Program (CIP) there are no planned improvements
that would impact the study intersections. There are a few projects in the vicinity of the site
including signal upgrade, restriping and intersection reconstruction on three E Alder Street
intersections between 6th Avenue and Palouse Street.




                                                                                                                2
Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic counts were collected in December 2014. Detailed turning
movement counts are provided as Attachment A. Future 2017 traffic volumes were forecast by
applying an annual growth rate of one percent per year to existing traffic volumes. Traffic
generated by the proposed project was estimated, distributed, and assigned to the study
intersections.

Trip Generation
Trip generation estimates for the project were prepared utilizing standard rates published in the
ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition for the hotel land use. The additional project elements
and hotel amenities described previously in this memorandum are noted in the land use
description for a hotel. As such the trip generation is based on the number of hotel rooms, as the
trips associated with the other amenities are included in the calculation of the rate. This approach
is consistent with the memorandum subjected: Walla Walla Hotel – Trip Generation Analysis,
October 20, 2014 previously reviewed by the City. A summary of the weekday daily and PM peak
hour trips for the proposed project is shown in Table 2.

The proposed project is anticipated to generate 572 trips during the weekday period, with 37
occurring during the AM peak hour and 42 occurring during the weekday PM peak hour. This
study, however, focused solely on the PM peak hour for analysis.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Distribution of project traffic considers the regional drawn of the hotel use such that the majority of
travel would be to and from SR 12, the location of parking hotel parking, and existing travel
patterns. As discussed previously, parking for the hotel would be provided via off-site parking lots.
One of the potential parking lots (B), as shown on Figure 1, is located about 3 blocks north of the
site; therefore, vehicles going directly to this lot would likely not impact the study intersections. The
hotel would provide valet so it was assumed project trips begin and end at the site. The weekday
PM peak hour project trip distribution is provided on Figure 3.




                                                                                                              3

Project generated traffic was assigned to the roadway network and added to the future without-
project traffic volumes based on the distribution patterns described to calculate the with-project
traffic volumes. Figure 4 summarizes existing, future without, and future with-project traffic
volumes.

Traffic Operations
Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations were evaluated based on the procedures identified in
the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010) for signalized and
unsignalized intersections, and using Synchro 8.0. Future with-project analysis assumes the same
intersection parameters such as channelization, intersection control, and signal timings as without-
project conditions.

The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the intersection
level of service (LOS). LOS for intersection operations is described alphabetically with A
representing free flowing traffic and F representing severe traffic congestion. LOS is based on the
calculated average control delay per vehicle and if signalized, is typically reported for the whole
intersection. In the case of two way stop control, the LOS and delay are reported for the worst
movement.

The City of Walla Walla, in conjunction the State of Washington’s Growth Management Act has
defined the standard acceptable LOS for urban areas to be LOS D and non-urban areas to be
LOS C. All study intersections for this project reside in an urban area. Results for the existing,
future without-project, and future with-project weekday PM peak hour are summarized in Table 3.
Detailed LOS worksheets are included in Attachment C.

1.   Level of service (LOS), based on 2000 Highway Capacity Manual methodology.
2.   Average delay in seconds per vehicle.
3.   Worst movement required for unsignalized intersections


As shown in Table 3, all of the intersections operate at LOS B or better and meet the City’s LOS D
standard for urban area intersections under existing, future without-project, and future with-project
conditions.


Conclusion
The proposed project would generate 42 trips during the weekday PM peak hour. The intersection
operations analysis indicates that the study intersections operate at LOS B or better and would
meet the City’s LOS standard. No specific off-site mitigation improvements are recommended
based on compliance with City requirements and the level of impact anticipated.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
