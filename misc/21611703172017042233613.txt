Principal Planner Karen Vaughn gave presentation on the Scoping Session
for the Environmental Impact Report for the proposed Veterans Memorial
Senior Center/YMCA Project. She provided a roadmap for the presentation.

Director of Parks and Recreation and Community Services Chris Beth
discussed the background of the proposed project (presentation on file). He
stated that no design decisions have been made at this point. He stated
that they plan to hire an architect in 2017 to begin the project design. The
EIR will analyze potential impacts posed by the development.

Shannon George, David J. Powers and Associates, discussed the process
for CEQA for this project. She stated the purpose of CEQA is to inform the
public, engage the public in the environmental review process, disclose
potential impacts of the potential project, and avoid and/or reduce potential
impacts of the proposed project. She stated they would be conducting an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for this project. She stated the first step
of the CEQA process – issuing a Notice of Preparation (NOP) – has already
been initiated. She provided an overview of the next steps. She stated that
the intent of the scoping meeting is to identify the issues that need to be
addressed including air quality, noise, traffic, etc.

Karen Vaughn stated that they are currently in the Notice of Preparation
period. She stated that period ends December 16, 2017. She stated that
anyone wishing to submit comments should do so. Once that period ends,
a draft EIR will be prepared and released. Once the draft is released, there
will be a public comment and review period. Those comments will be folded
into a final EIR that will be reviewed again by the Planning Commission for
final review and recommendation before bringing it to the City Council. Ms.
Vaughn stated that concurrently to this process, an architect will be hired to
design the project. She stated that the goal is in 9-12 months the EIR
process and the design process will come together.

Commissioner Schmidt asked if any projects had been done to estimate the
city’s elderly population in 2030.

Chris Beth stated that they had not at those projects and had instead taken
from the last census.

Commissioner Schmidt stated that San Mateo county anticipates that the
population will be 65% overall over the age of 65 by 2030.

Commissioner Schmidt asked what would happen to the gym currently
located on Roosevelt.

Chris Beth stated that nothing would happen to the Red Morton center.

Commission Hale asked what the intended age demographic is for the
YMCA. She also asked if the YMCA would require a membership for use.

Chris Beth stated that a multi-generational facility is appealing. He also
stated that their goal is provide needed services to the elderly – specifically


                    Page 2 of 9
in terms of fitness. He stated that the YMCA works on a membership
model, but also has drop-in rates.

PUBLIC HEARING
M/S (Schmidt/Hale) to open the public hearing.

John Spotorno expressed his concern for the project, stating that it appears
to have too much construction for a park design. He stated he’d like to see
more consideration for the surrounding site. He stated he’d like to see the
design incorporate more green space. He asked if programming could be
spread to other areas of the park and also suggested that sustainable
strategies be implemented.

Walter T. Moore stated that he is thrilled for this development of project and
is looking forward to it being a resource for the community.

Kevin Heuer stated that he is alarmed by the scope and size of the project.
He fears that it will ruin the current integrity of the neighborhood. He stated
that the council should consider the implications of the development on the
neighborhood. He suggested that the scope of work be lowered to a more
reasonable level.

Debbie Moore, Board Member with the Redwood City Sharks Swim Team,
expressed concern for the development of the new YMCA and how that will
affect the long-standing tradition of the swim team at the preexisting
community pool. She stated that she would like to see the new pool support
swim teams and water polo, but has concerns that an indoor pool would be
very noisy.

Michael Simos stated that it appears the project doesn’t reflect the
character of the area. He expressed concern for losing some of the open
space in the area. He also expressed concern for the impact the
development will have on traffic. He also expressed concern for the
potential for noise pollution caused by the project. He stated that he does
support developing and improving the area, but he does not like the size of
the current design.

Michael Hitchcock stated alternatives he would like considered in the EIR.
He stated that he would like to see all the same facilities, but dispersed
throughout the city. He also stated that he would like to see a transit
alternative to the parking structure.

Steven Hernandez stated that he does not feel the proposed development
fits the property or the area. He is concerned that the development will hurt
the integrity of the area. He would like to see how the EIR address the size
of membership. He suggested rehabilitating existing buildings.

Michelle Klein expressed concerns similar to other speakers. She stated
that she is concerned about the additional stress that this development will
put on the traffic in the area and that the proposed building is too large.

JoEllen Williams stated that the project is far too large for the
neighborhood. She is concerned about paying for services at the YMCA on


                    Page 3 of 9
   property owned by Redwood City. She also expressed her concern for the
   traffic in the area. She also expressed concerns about chlorine fumes
   associated with an indoor pool.

   M/S (Schmidt/Hunter) to close the public hearing

   COMMISSIONER COMMENTS

   Chair Radcliffe stated that, at this stage, there is no formal development or
   design plan. She encouraged the community to remain active in the
   development of this project.

   Commissioner Schmidt asked a clarification question about whether the
   potential development cost of property would be $20 million. Mr. Beth
   stated that because no design exists so they do not have an estimated
   price.

B. General Plan Map Amendment Initiation, Environmental Review,
   General Plan Amendment to designate a portion of Sandpiper Park as
   Public Facilities for the City pump station and a new shared-use
   Sandpiper School classroom building at 797 Redwood Shores
   Parkway, and General Plan Consistency Finding for disposition of
   reap property

   Contract Principal Planner Costa Sanders gave a presentation for the
   proposed development at 797 Redwood Shores Parkway. She provided an
   overview of the staff presentation.

   Michael Milliken, Superintendent of the Belmont Redwood Shores
   Elementary School District, provided a background of the district and the
   project. He provided an overview of the community outreach they have
   done in the development of this project.

   Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated the item before the Planning
   Commission is the initiation of the General Plan Map amendment. She
   stated that the Planning Commission should make a recommendation to
   the City Council whether or not to approve the mitigated negative
   declaration including the mitigation monitoring and reporting plan. She also
   stated the Planning Commission should make a recommendation to the
   City Council to adopt the General Plan Map Amendment and make a
   determination of general plan consistency for the new building on city
   property.

   Principal Planner Costa Sanders gave a presentation of the project
   description (project on file). She provided an overview of the proposed site
   plan and elevation. She provided an overview of the Joint Use Agreement
   for the proposed development. She provided an overview of the General
   Plan Map Amendment.

   Demetri Loukas, Project Manager at David J. Powers & Associates,
   provided an overview of the CEQA analysis. He stated that the initial CEQA
   analysis identified some impacts including air quality, biological resources,
   cultural resources, geology and soils, and noise. Mr. Lucas stated that most


                       Page 4 of 9
of these impacts are construction-related, as is typical of most projects. He
stated that all identified impacts would be reduced to less than significant
levels; therefore, they prepared a mitigated negative declaration for the
project. That declaration was circulated for thirty days. Mr. Lucas discussed
public comments made of the CEQA analysis.

Ollie Zhou, Engineer with Hexagon Transportation Consultants, discussed
the parking lot reconfiguration and the findings of the traffic study. He stated
that the new design would reconfigure the parking lot to create better flow
through the area. He stated that the traffic study found no significant traffic
impact based on city standards. He stated that all intersections were found
to operate at acceptable levels of service.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that this project is unique since it is
a public school on city property. She stated that under CEQA guidelines,
Redwood City is considered the lead agency as required to consider the
mitigated negative declaration. As discussed, the project does include a
General Plan Land Use Map Amendment.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders provided an overview of the Staff’s
recommendation to the Planning Commission (recommendations on file).

COMMISSIONER QUESTIONS

PUBLIC HEARING

M/S (Guerrero/Hale) to open the public hearing

Mary Morrisey Parden spoke specifically about proposed placement of a
new trash enclosure structure on the existing landscape area adjacent to
the sidewalk on the east side of the project. She stated that she would ask
that applicant keep the current trash structure or design a new one. She
stated that the current design is inconsistent with the General Plan. She
stated that she would like to see the Planning Commission recommend that
the relocate the trash enclosure from the street side of the site.

Ken Grayson proposed a question about how the development will impact
current soccer fields already on the property.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that the city has plans to replace
the turf on the soccer field during 2017.

Michael Milliken responded to the trash enclosure structure issue raised by
Ms. Parden. He stated that, in meetings with the community, they prioritized
the location of the basketball courts and the trash enclosure structure. The
location of these amenities was impacted by the location of the public
bathroom. He stated that the current proposed location of the trash
enclosure was the result of several rounds of community feedback.

COMMISSIONER COMMENTS



                     Page 5 of 9
Commissioner Schmidt asked a question about community outreach. He
asked about the frequency and participant statistics of the community
outreach meetings.

Michael Milliken stated that they attended two HOA board meetings, the
RSCA board meeting, and meeting with the leadership of the Regatta
Homeowners Association, as well as holding two community outreach
meetings in January and March of 2016. He stated that about 30 people
attended the January meeting and about 50 people attended the March
meeting. The March meeting included a site walkthrough.

Commissioner Schmidt asked if there were any issues that the community
brought up that were not addressed.

Michael Milliken stated that he could not recall significant concerns that
weren’t addressed.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that there were general concerns
about traffic overall.

Commissioner Schmidt asked how the General Plan Amendment is
different from the one discussed on November 15, 2017.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that this General Plan Amendment
is significantly different since it is simply a minor change in land use that
allows for the expansion of land use that could be located at this site.

Commissioner Guerrero stated that she is familiar with the community
dynamics in the Redwood Shores/Belmont area and she is hopeful that the
project will alleviate some issues.

Commissioner Guerrero asked if bell times would change based on grade
levels. She also asked where the construction staging would take place and
where the construction workers would park.

Mike Milliken stated that they hope to use the parking lot better than it has
been used in the past by using two lanes for drop off. He stated that they
are open to staggered start times if the parking issues end up being worse
than projected.

Steve White, Principal at IPI Group Architects and Planners, stated that he
expects the construction staging area to be along the backside of the
building where the restroom is.s.

Commissioner Guerrero asked whether or not the construction workers
would be parking in the neighborhoods.


Michael Milliken stated that they are interested in being a good neighbor to
ensure that they do not upset or frustrate the community during the
development process.




                    Page 6 of 9
Commissioner Guerrero asked if the building would have dual plumbing for
recycled water.

Steve White stated that they considered the possibility of dual plumbing in
the building, however, problems regarding the potential for smell deterred
them from pursuing it.

Commissioner Hale stated that she sees the proposed development as
incredibly consistent with the goals outlined in the General Plan. She stated
that she is happy with the level of participation the community has had in
the development process.

Commissioner Hunter stated that he believes the development could have
been designated as a school or public facility. He asked if there were any
pro or cons to one designation over the other.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that a school designation would
limit the shared use opportunities being presented. She also stated that the
current designation attempts to encompass the existing land use of the
pump facility. She stated that the public facility designation is a broader
designation.

Commissioner Hunter expressed his concern for nearby nesting areas for
local wildlife.
Demetri Loukas stated that if a bird nest was found in the area, depending
on the species, they would be a consultation with Fish and Wildlife to
establish a buffer of anywhere from 50 to 200 feet. He stated that he has
not seen a project delayed for this reason, but it could be.

Commissioner Hunter asked about two of the letters that were received on
January 6, 2016.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that she is comfortable that all the
comments have been appropriately analyzed and addressed.

Commissioner Hunter expressed concern over some of the language in the
letter from CalTrans.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that a CalTrans permit is not
required and has attempted to clarify this with CalTrans, but has not yet
received a reply.

Commissioner Hunter asked Planning Manager Turner whether it was
common to make small changes to the General Plan.

Planning Manager Turner stated that it is rare for changes to the General
Plan to be made. He stated that this proposed change is only the second in
2016 that Staff have brought forward.

Commissioner Schmidt raise the issue of where the construction workers
will park. He stated that this is the first project in recent memory where
there is no plan for where those individuals will park. He stated he is
concerned about the lack of parking plan. He also raised the issue of the


                    Page 7 of 9
lack of purple piping and the use of recycled water. He stated that he had
never had an issue with smell, so he would be interested to hear more
about that.

Steve White stated there was consideration for recycled water in the
building, however, they opted not to pursue it because it’s not a common
plumbing approach outside of small residential developments. He stated
that they are still planning to use recycled water for the external irrigation
systems.

Michael Milliken stated that if the standard and expectation of the city is to
use recycled water within the building, they are happy to comply; however,
he stated that he didn’t believe there was the necessary infrastructure and
plumbing in place to allow for recycled water.

Principal Planner Costa Sanders stated that when she discussed this issue
with City engineering staff, they indicated that the site does not have
access to recycled water and there are no current plans in the foreseeable
future to extend it to the site.

Commissioner Schmidt asked community member Mary Morrisey Parden
whether or not she felt like her comments were heard.

Ms. Parden stated that she does not feel her comments were heard. She
recommended the inclusion of a berm in front of the trash enclosure
structure.

Michael Milliken addressed the issue of parking for construction workers.
He stated that these types of logistics are typically handled by the
construction management point person and there is sufficient room on-site.

Chair Radcliffe requested that contact information for the project contractor
be posted so community members may reach out with concerns or
questions.

Chair Radcliffe stated that with regards to the General Plan Amendment,
she believes it’s important to look at different districts and areas. She stated
that she views this amendment as more of a cleanup rather than creating a
whole new provision.

Commissioner Guerrero thanked the applicant for the work that went into
community outreach. She seconded Chair Radcliffe’s point about posting a
point of contact for the public.

Chair Radcliffe stated that there are two recommendations from the
Planning Commission. The first recommendation would be for the applicant
to post a point of contact so that the public may reach out with questions or
concerns. The second recommendation would be for the applicant to
continue looking at landscape options for the trash enclosure structure.

Commissioner Hale asked whether or not the Planning Commission may
bundle the three resolutions into one.

of 37 feet, four inches. The project would provide one central driveway from Woodside
Road. The central driveway would be covered with living space and secured with a
wood slat gate along the public sidewalk. The project consists of stucco walls, a metal
roof and green roof, and horizontal wood details.

The project would provide a density of 32.6 dwelling units per acre. The project would
provide balconies for private open space ranging in size between 87 and 272 square
feet per balcony (between 125 and 459 square feet of balcony area per unit). The
project would provide 3,362 square feet of pervious area, including a 1,411 square foot
green roof. The green roof provides an innovative approach to provide pervious area
and meet the stormwater requirements (also known as C.3 requirements). In addition to
providing pervious area and stormwater treatment, the green roof would reduce the roof
area that reflects the sun, which supports sustainability goals of the City of Redwood
City General Plan, and absorb sound.

Landscaping would be provided in the front and rear of the site, and on the roof. All 13
existing trees on the site would be removed. The two existing street trees would be
removed and replaced with four new street trees. The project would provide a
designated area for trash and recycling for each unit accessed from the interior of
garage, and the bins would be moved to the curb on pickup days. Personal storage of
189 cubic feet would also be provided off the garage. Secured bicycle lockers would be
provided at the rear of the site with capacity for four bicycles. The project would also
provide two bike racks in the public right-of-way.

The request to merge the existing parcels into one lot and create for-sale condominiums
requires a Tentative Map and Condominium Permit. A Condominium Permit requires a
Planned Development Permit pursuant to Municipal Code Section 30.134. The
applicant is requesting to provide no guest parking pursuant to Zoning Code Section
30.4.

ANALYSIS

Zoning Compliance
The subject property is located in the Mixed-Use Neighborhood (MUN) Zoning Sub-
District. Zoning Code Article 54 (Mixed-Use Neighborhood) serves as the regulatory
framework with which the project must comply. Article 54 presents the vision and intent
of the MUN zoning district:

•   Provide opportunities for moderate-scale developments that facilitate pedestrian-
    friendly environments;
•   Provide areas for a variety of activities, including commercial, office, and moderate-
    density residential, or a mixture thereof; and
•   Consideration for sensitivity to lower-intensity adjacent uses, focus on pedestrian
    and street-oriented design, and uses that serve the immediate neighborhoods.
The project is consistent with the MUN zoning district vision and intent in that it would
provide a moderate-density residential use. The project would provide a pedestrian and
street-oriented design with new sidewalks, street trees, and front entries facing
Woodside Road. The project would provide housing near SamTrans transit (Routes 72,
275, 278) and commercial uses including grocery, food, and personal service
businesses.

As provided in Article 54, the Mixed-Use Neighborhood Zoning District has regulations
for use; new streets and pathways; open space; sidewalks, setbacks, and landscaping;
parking and storage; height, density, and intensity; and façade composition and
architecture. The project complies with all applicable regulations of Article 54 as shown
in Table 1 below.

                                     30% of the building face facing the street on the ground floor,
                                     and at least 20% of the building face facing the street on the
                                     upper-floors.
                                 •   Ground floor design would meet the elevation requirements
                                     because it would be 1.3 feet above existing grade, and would
                                     meet the ground floor height requirement because the ground
                                     floor height would be 10 feet.
                                 •   The project would respect, complement, and be compatible
                                     with the scale, style, theme, and design of the surrounding
                                     buildings and neighborhoods in that the project uses building
                                     materials that match adjacent buildings and balances the
                                     variation in height of adjacent buildings.


Based on the analysis above, staff determined that the project is consistent with the
regulations and intent of the MUN district.

Architectural Advisory Committee Review and Recommendation
The Architectural Advisory Committee (AAC) reviewed the project on August 18, 2016
and continued the item with direction to revise the front elevation, modify the mass, and
provide details of proposed materials. The AAC reviewed the revised project on October
20, 2016, continued the item and directed the applicant to better integrate the first floor
with the second and third floors. On November 3, 2016, the AAC reviewed revised
elevation and unanimously recommended that the Planning Commission approve the
project as revised.

Planned Development Permit
The project requires a Planned Development Permit because Municipal Code Section
30.134 requires a Planned Development Permit for a Condominium Permit. Staff’s
analysis of the Condominium Permit is provided below in the Tentative Map,
Condominium Permit, and Required Findings section (Page 7). As described in Zoning
Code Section 46 (Planned Development Permits) the Planning Commission shall
determine whether or not the Project carries out the objectives of Planned
Developments.

The purpose of a Planned Development Permit is to:
   • Encourage flexibility of design and development of land in such a manner as to
      promote its most appropriate use;
   • Encourage the development of innovative projects which incorporate the highest
      quality architectural solutions, building materials and landscaping concepts;
   •   Promote the most functional and aesthetic relationships between building
       structures, signs, open space and parking areas in residential, commercial and
       industrial zoning districts;
   •   Encourage the development of quality open space and recreational opportunities
       within projects, including providing for clustered development and increased
       open space; and
   •   Incorporate stormwater treatment provisions in site planning.

Further, with a Planned Development Permit, the design and construction quality
contained in all aspects of the proposed development plan is expected to exceed the
quality standards typically required for new developments located in similar zoning
districts.

The proposed project is consistent with the intent of the Planned Development Permit
as follows:
• The project promotes the most appropriate use of the site in that it would provide a
    moderate-density residential project with sensitivity to adjacent uses and street-
    orientated design.
• The project is innovative in that it would provide Redwood City’s first green roof.
• The project provides a functional and aesthetic parking design in that one vehicular
    access covered by floor area results in less visible parking and less asphalt exposed
    to reflect heat from the sun.
• The project encourages the development of quality open space in that balconies are
    provided for all units, and stormwater treatment provisions are included in the site
    plan.

Staff believes that the project would exceed the standards typically required for new
developments through provision of a green roof and varied and high quality architectural
details.

Parking Request
The project requires one guest parking space for every four units for a total of three
guest spaces. The applicant is requesting to eliminate the provision of guest spaces.

Section 30.4 of the Zoning Code permits the responsible review authority to reduce or
eliminate the required number of guest or visitor spaces for a multiple dwelling
development if one (1) of the following conditions applies:

   a. Adequate street parking is available, and/or
   b. Only one (1) parking space is reserved per unit for residents, and/or
   c. The site is in close proximity to retail shopping facilities and services.

The project site is in close proximity to retail shopping facilities and services, including
groceries, pharmacies, cleaners, and several food establishments. Therefore, staff
believes the request to eliminate guest spaces can be granted.

TENTATIVE MAP, CONDOMINIUM PERMIT, AND REQUIRED FINDINGS (SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE)
The project requires approval of a Tentative Map per Chapter 30, Article III of the
Municipal Code (the Subdivision Ordinance). The project site is comprised of two
contiguous parcels that would be combined to create a single lot totaling 13,629 square
feet, and subdivided to create 10 residential condominiums. Subdivision Ordinance
Section 30.42 requires the hearing authority to disapprove a tentative map if any of the
following findings can be made:

   1. The map, design or improvements of the proposed subdivision are inconsistent
      with the general or specific plans, the zoning ordinance, or subdivision
      improvement requirements.

      The proposed tentative map and associated improvements are consistent with
      Redwood City’s General Plan, Municipal Code, and Zoning Ordinance, and all
      applicable subdivision improvement requirements. The project would allow two
      parcels to become one parcel to create a more cohesive project. The exception
      to guest parking is allowed upon satisfaction of the conditions described in
      Zoning Code Section 30.4.

   2. The site is not physically suited for the proposed type or density of development.

      The project site is physically suited for the type and density of the proposed
      development. The site is located in an urbanized location. The site is generally
      flat and would have frontage and access from Woodside Road.

   3. The design or proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial
      environmental damage, or substantially and avoidably injure fish, wildlife or their
      habitat, or cause serious public health problems.

      The site is located within an urbanized setting and is currently developed with a
      commercial use, which would be replaced with the proposed residential
      development. The proposed tentative map and associated improvements would
      not pose substantial environmental damage, injure fish, wildlife, or habitat, or
      cause serious public health problems.

   4. The design or improvements of the proposed subdivision will conflict with
      essential public easements for access through, or use of, property within the
      proposed subdivision, unless acceptable alternate public easements will be
      provided.

      The proposed tentative map and associated improvements would not conflict
      with essential public easements for access through, or use of, property within the
      proposed subdivision. There are no existing public easements, and a proposed
      public easement would permit a public sidewalk on a portion of the property.

   5. The reasons submitted for the granting of any exceptions applied for do not
      comply with requirements for findings described in Section 30.69, and the
      tentative map is deemed not workable without the granting of such exceptions.

      No exceptions from subdivision requirements are requested.
   6. Such other findings of conflict with written public policy or with the public interest
      as the Planning Commission may determine.
        The proposed project does not conflict with any written public policy or with the
        public interest.

The Plan Review Committee reviewed the proposed Tentative Map and recommended
conditions of approval regarding the proposed subdivision. These conditions of approval
are included in Attachment 1 and serve as the Plan Review Committee’s
recommendations required by Section 30.40. Staff believes that the findings to
disapprove a Tentative Map cannot be made for the proposed tentative map and
associated improvements and, therefore, the tentative map could be approved.

The project requires approval of a Condominium Permit per R e d w o o d C i t y
M u n i c i p a l C o d e Chapter 30 (Subdivisions), Article XI ( C o n d o m i n i u m s ) .
Subdivision Ordinance Section 30.138 requires the Planning Commission to approve a
Condominium Permit if the requirements of Article XI have been complied with. The
project complies with applicable requirements of Article XI as shown in Table 2 below.

GENERAL PLAN
When reviewing development applications, consistency with applicable General Plan
Goals and Policies shall also apply. The City Council of Redwood City adopted by
resolution a comprehensive update of the Redwood City General Plan on October 11,
2010. The New General Plan for Redwood City includes a land use map showing the
subject property with a land use designation of Mixed Use – Neighborhood. The Mixed
Use – Neighborhood Development Standards limit single use residential density to 40
dwelling units per acre and maximum height to 3 stories. The project would provide 32.6
dwelling units per acre, less than the maximum residential density. The project would
create a three-story, 37 feet four inch high building, which does not exceed the height
limit. Therefore, the project is consistent with the Mixed Use – Neighborhood land use
Development Standards.
Within the General Plan, the city’s vision for Woodside Road “J is an attractive,
walkable residential boulevard with mixed-use nodes that residents can easily walk to . .
. [and] is an ideal area for new residential development . . .” The vision states that “infill
residential development should incorporate landscaped setbacks while emphasizing the
pedestrian orientation of frontages in site and building design.” The project would
provide a residential development near a grocery store and bus stops, and provide new
street trees and widened sidewalks.

The project is subject to and complies with General Plan Goals, Polices, and Programs,
including, but not limited to:

§ Policy BE-1.8: Require that new projects are integrated as seamlessly as possible
  into surrounding development, creating extensions of urban fabric.
§ Policy BE-3.5: Require building and site frontages that define public streets with
  high-quality architectural and landscape design, including small-scale architectural
  elements and plane changes.
§ Goal BE-11: Create memorable and engaging retail, residential, and mixed-use
  destinations and paths along the corridors.
§ Policy BE-11.1: Improve the corridors to create a network of “complete streets” that
  emphasized pedestrian orientation and safety, public transit access, safe bicycle
  movement, and other improvements.
§ Policy BE-11.5: Improve public streetscapes along the corridors, including widened
  sidewalks and crosswalks, protected crosswalks, regular street tree planting, bus
  shelters and street furniture, and pedestrian-oriented street lighting.
§ Policy BE-11.7: Provide the appropriate density and intensity of land uses to
  facilitate high levels of transit use along corridors.
§ Policy BE-11.8: Ensure that buildings along corridors are sensitive to adjacent
  neighborhoods, providing adequate scale transitions.
§ Goal BE-13: Enhance the Woodside Road Corridor as an attractive residential
  boulevard with walkable mixed-use neighborhood centers, a pedestrian and transit-
  oriented character, and consistent design elements that unify its image.
§ Policy BE-13.4: Support new higher-density residential development on Woodside
  Road, while ensuring that new development is sensitive to adjacent single-unit
  residential neighborhoods.
§ Policy BE-23.7: Promote higher residential densities at locations near or within
  commercial, financial, and compatible employment, and also transportation corridors
  where neighborhood services are available.
§ Policy PS-13.10: Do not allow new residential or other noise sensitive land use
  development in noise impacted areas unless effective mitigation measures are
  incorporated into the project design to reduce outdoor activity area noise levels.
§ Program PS-61: Acoustical Analyses. Require acoustical analyses, as appropriate,
  for proposed stand-alone residential development within the 60dB CNEL or higher
  contour, as shown in Figure PS-12. Require incorporation of mitigation measures as
  necessary to reduce noise levels to levels deemed appropriate by the City.

The proposed project is a residential building that would provide for-sale housing in
close proximity to goods and services, and transportation. The site is within walking
distance to a grocery store, cafes, and restaurants, and services such as a salon and
dry cleaner. The site is near bus lines (routes 72, 275, and 278).
The project is designed with ground floor entries facing Woodside Road and one
driveway entrance to minimize the disruption of the pedestrian way. Pedestrian-scale
design features include a widened sidewalk, pedestrian site lighting, and street trees.
The project provides a higher density development along a corridor while respecting
existing adjacent multi-family development by providing step backs in the design.

Noise
The property in located in the noise contours for 60-65, 65-70, and 70-75 dB(A) (Figure
PS-11: 2010 Existing Noise Contours). The applicant provided a Noise Assessment in
compliance with General Plan policies and programs. The project includes design
measures to reduce the noise levels to acceptable levels and the project would be
conditioned to provide these design measures as part of the project’s construction
methods. The General Plan Public Safety Element and Figure PS-10: Redwood City
Noise Guidelines for Land Use Planning identifies noise levels of 60 dB to 75 dB for
Mixed-Use Districts to be conditionally acceptable. Conditionally acceptable states that
new development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of noise reduction
requirements are made. In addition, the Public Safety Element identifies that Title 24 of
the California Health and Safety Code stipulates a maximum of 45 dBA CNEL for
interior residential noise levels.

The Noise Assessment found the interior noise exposure would be up to 48 dB with
existing and future traffic conditions, and the noise level produced by the Auto Pride Car
Wash dryers would be up to 41 dBA. The Noise Assessment recommended noise
control measures to achieve interior noise standards, which are incorporated as
condition of approval 60 in Attachment 1. Typical noise reduction building features that
would be used include installation of rated windows and doors, air-tight seals, and
perimeter caulking. With implementation of the recommended noise control measures,
the project would meet the General Plan conditionally acceptable 60 dB to 75 dB mixed-
Use noise level, and the Title 24 maximum 45 dBA interior noise level. Condition of
approval 60 (Attachment 1) requires certification by the applicant’s noise consultant that
the building permit plans are prepared to meet the applicable requirements and
standards of the General Plan Public Safety Element – Noise.

Affordable Housing
The project is subject to the City’s Affordable Housing Impact Fee (AHIF). This fee is
imposed on new residential and commercial developments to mitigate a project’s impact
on the need for affordable housing. The project’s AHIF is estimated to be $430,340.00.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The City reviewed the project to determine whether further environmental review is
required under CEQA beyond the General Plan EIR (Clearinghouse #2010052034)
certified on October 11, 2010. The General Plan EIR evaluated, among other potential
impacts, traffic and noise. The General Plan for Redwood City designates the property
within the Mixed Use Neighborhood land use category. The project would provide 32.6
dwelling units per acre, less than the maximum 40 dwelling units per acre residential
density. The project would create a three story, 37 feet 1 ½ inch high building, which
does not exceed the three story height limit. Therefore, the project is consistent with the
Mixed Use neighborhood land use designation and General Plan for Redwood City in
terms of density and intensity.

Based on the discussion above and contained in the CEQA Exemption memo
(Attachment 2), no new impacts beyond what was identified in the General Plan EIR
were identified and the project does not require further environmental review under
CEQA Section 15183 “Projects Consistent with a Community Plan or Zoning.”

PUBLIC NOTIFICATION
The City performed the following public notifications for this meeting:

•   Mailed notifications: A public hearing notice was mailed to property owners,
    occupants, and interested parties within a 300-foot radius from the property.
•   Newspaper Publication & Posting: A public hearing notice was published in the Daily
    News on January 6, 2017, and posted notice on the City Hall public notice board and
    on the project site’s publically-accessible frontage on Woodside Road at least 10
    days prior to the public hearing.
•   Online Engagement: City staff created a webpage for the project on the City’s
    website, with access to project plans, public notices, and agenda packets.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Defer action, and direct staff to provide additional CEQA analysis or project
   revisions.
2. Approve the Condominium Permit, Tentative Map, and Planned Community Permit,
   but modify the conditions of approval in Attachment 1.
3. Deny the Condominium Permit, Tentative Map, and Planned Community Permit.

       WHEREAS, at the January 17, 2017, public hearing, the Planning Commission
considered the Redwood City General Plan EIR (Clearinghouse #2010052034),staff
reports, oral and written, and testimony and materials presented by all those wishing
to be heard on this Project at the noticed public hearing on this matter; and

      WHEREAS, at the January 17, 2017, public hearing, the Planning Commission
considered and accepted the recommendation of the AAC regarding the Project's
proposed architecture; and

       WHEREAS, the City Council of Redwood City adopted by resolution a
comprehensive update of the Redwood City General Plan on October 11, 2010. The New
General Plan for Redwood City designates the property with Mixed Use Neighborhood
land use category. The Mixed Use Neighborhood Development Standards limit single use
residential density to 40 dwelling units per acre and maximum height to 3 stories. The
project would provide 32.6 dwelling units per acre, less than the maximum residential

the development density established by existing zoning, community plan, or general
plan policies for which an EIR was certified, except as might be necessary to examine
whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project
or its site; and

      WHEREAS, the Planning Commission determined that the proposed
Condominium Permit, Tentative Map and Planned Development Permit would further
the purposes of and appropriately implement the City of Redwood City General Plan,
and applicable provisions of the Redwood City Municipal Code and Zoning
Ordinance.

        NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:

      Section 1. The Planning Commission, having independently heard, considered
and weighed all the evidence in the record, including evidence presented by City staff,
the Applicant, and members of the public, and being fully informed of the Project, finds

ATTY/RESO.0002/PC RESO 910 WOODSIDE
REV: 01-11-17 PR
                                         Page 2 of 20
that the above recitals are accurate and constitute findings in this matter and, together
with the Staff Report and the application materials, including without limitation the
development plans, and all other documents, reports, studies, memoranda, maps, oral
and written testimony, and materials in the City's file for the applications and the Project,
and all adopted City planning documents relating to the Project and the property including
the City's General Plan, General Plan EIR, the Redwood City Municipal Code, the
Redwood City Zoning Ordinance, other applicable City laws and regulations, and all
associated approved and certified environmental documents, have together served as an
adequate and appropriate evidentiary basis for the findings and actions set forth in this
Resolution.

    Section 2. CEQA: In the exercise of its independent judgment, the Planning
Commission finds that:

            a. The Planning Commission has reviewed and analyzed information in the
               entire record and has considered such information, including the written and
               oral comments received at the public hearing, prior to acting upon or
               approving the Project.
            b. Based on substantial evidence in the record, the proposed Project is within
               the scope of the previously approved General Plan and is adequately
               described in the General Plan EIR for purposes of CEQA. The mitigation
               measures and Statement of Overriding Considerations associated with
               certification of the General Plan EIR address the environmental effects of
               the Project. Accordingly, with the approval of this Project, all applicable
               mitigation measures and the Statement of Overriding Considerations are
               hereby reconfirmed and readopted.
            c. As set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15183, subdivisions (a) and (b),
               the proposed Project is consistent with the Redwood City General Plan,
               which establishes development density consistent with the proposed
               development density associated with the Project. Further, there are no
               environmental effects which are peculiar to the project or its site, nor are
               there any new significant effects that were not already identified and
               analyzed in the certified EIR, nor are there any potentially significant off-site
               impacts or cumulative impacts that were not already identified and analyzed
               in the certified EIR, nor is there any new information which was not known
               at the time of the certification of the EIR that identifies any significant effects
               which will have a more severe adverse impact than discussed in the
               certified EIR. Further, as set forth in subdivision (d) of CEQA Guidelines
               section 15183, the proposed Project is consistent with the General Plan,
               and an EIR was prepared for the General Plan. For these reasons, no
               further environmental review is required pursuant to CEQA.
            d. Pursuant to Guidelines section 15091(e), the documents and other
               materials that constitute the record of proceedings upon which the Planning
               Commission has based its decision are located in and may be obtained

                from, the Office of the City Clerk at 1017 Middlefield Road, Redwood City
                California. The City Clerk is the custodian of records for all matters before
                the City.

      Section 3.   Tentative Map TM2015-008: In the exercise of its independent
judgment, the Planning Commission finds that Tentative Map TM2015-008 does not
need to be denied pursuant to Section 30.42 of the City’s Municipal Code because:

            a. The map, design or improvements of the proposed subdivision are
               consistent with Redwood City’s General Plan, Municipal Code, and Zoning
               Ordinance, and all applicable subdivision improvements requirements. The
               project would allow two parcels to become one parcel to create a more
               cohesive project.
            b. The site is physically suited for the proposed type or density of
               development. The site is located in an urbanized location. The site is
               generally flat and would have frontage and access from Woodside Road.
            c. The design or proposed improvements would not cause substantial
               environmental damage, or substantially and avoidably injure fish, wildlife or
               their habitat, or cause serious public health problems.
            d. The design or improvements of the proposed subdivision would not conflict
               with essential public easements for access through, or use of, property
               within the proposed subdivision in that there are no existing public
               easements, and a proposed public easement would permit a public
               sidewalk a portion of the property. Wider sidewalks and improvements
               would be constructed along Woodside Road enhancing the pedestrian
               experience.
            e. No exceptions from subdivision requirements are requested and the
               tentative map is workable without the granting of exceptions.
            f. The proposed project does not conflict with any written public policy or with
               the public interest.

       Section 4. Tentative Map TM2015-008: The Planning Commission finds that the
proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is
consistent with the general plan as set forth in the staff report.

      Section 5.    Condominium Permit TM2015-008: In the exercise of its
independent judgment, the Planning Commission finds that the Project as proposed
complies with the requirements of Article XI of the Subdivision Ordinance.

      Section 6.  Planned Development Permit PD2016-004: In the exercise of its
independent judgment, the Planning Commission finds that:
   • The proposed project appropriately furthers the objectives of Article 46 of the
      Zoning Ordinance as follows:
         o The project promotes the most appropriate use of the site in that it would
ATTY/RESO.0002/PC RESO 910 WOODSIDE
REV: 01-11-17 PR
                                            Page 4 of 20
                provide a moderate-density residential project with sensitivity to adjacent
                uses and street-orientated design.
              o The project is innovative in that it would provide Redwood City’s first green
                roof.
              o The project provides a functional and aesthetic parking design in that one
                vehicular access covered by floor area results in less visible parking and
                less asphalt exposed to reflect heat from the sun.
     •    The project would exceed the standards typically required for new developments
          through provision of a green roof and varied and high quality architectural details.

       Section 7.   The Condominium Permit, Tentative Map, and Planned
Development Permit are hereby approved based on the Planning Commission's
consideration and reliance on the CEQA determination and in accordance with the
plans, details and descriptions contained therein, attached hereto and incorporated
herein by reference, and subject to the following Conditions of Approval:

                   bad muffler, etc.) and institute reasonable measures to correct the problem.
                   Post in a conspicuous location a telephone number for the Disturbance
                   Coordinator at the construction site and include it in the notice sent to
                   neighbors regarding the construction schedule. (The project sponsor should
                   be responsible for designating a Noise Disturbance Coordinator, posting the
                   phone number, and providing construction schedule notices. The Noise
                   Disturbance Coordinator would work directly with an assigned City staff
                   member.)

59. Construction Air Emissions – The applicant shall comply with the following measures
    to reduce air emissions during construction:[SDR][BUILDING]

                a. Water all exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas, staging areas, soil piles,
                   graded areas, and unpaved access roads) two times per day.

                b. Cover all haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material off-site.

                c. Remove all visible mud or dirt track-out onto adjacent public roads using wet
                   power vacuum street sweepers at least once per day. Dry power sweeping
                   is prohibited.

                d. Limit speeds of all vehicle on unpaved roads to 15 mph.

                e. Pave all roadways, driveways, and sidewalks as soon as possible. Building
                   pads shall be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding or soil
                   binders are used.

                f.   Minimize idling times either by shutting equipment off when not in use or
                     reducing the maximum idling time to 5 minutes (as required by the California
                     airborne toxics control measure Title 13, Section 2485 of California Code of
                     Regulations [CCR]). Provide clear signage for construction workers at all
                     access points.

                g. Maintain and properly tune all construction equipment in accordance with
                   manufacturer‘s specifications. All equipment shall be checked by a certified
                   visible emissions evaluator.

                h. Post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact
                   at the lead agency regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond and

                    take corrective action within 48 hours. The Air District‘s phone number shall
                    also be visible to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

60. Noise and Vibration – The applicant shall incorporate the following within the
    construction drawings per the site-specific Noise Assessment Study for the Planned
    Townhouse Development, Edward L. Pack Associates, Inc., May 12, 2016
    [SDR][PLANNING]

                a. The following additional precautionary measures are required to assure the
                   greatest potential for exterior-to-interior noise attenuation by the
                   recommended mitigation measures. These measures apply at those units
                   where closed windows are required.
                        i. If any penetrations in the building shell are required for vents, piping,
                           conduit, etc., sound leakage around these penetrations can be
                           controlled by sealing all cracks and clearance spaces with a non-
                           hardening caulking compound.
                       ii. Ventilation openings shall not compromise the acoustical integrity of
                           the building shell.
                b. Maintain closed at all times all windows and glass doors of the project facing
                   north, east or south at all floors. Install windows and glass doors rated
                   minimum Sound Transmission Class (STC) 34 at Units 1, 2, 9 and 10. Install
                   windows and glass doors rated minimum STC 31 at Units 3-8, as shown on
                   Figure 1. Provide some type of mechanical ventilation per the Mechanical
                   Code requirements. The project entry doors are exempt from these
                   recommendations.
                c. When windows are kept closed for noise control, they are to be operable, as
                   the requirement does not imply a “fixed” condition. In addition, some form of
                   mechanical ventilation which brings in fresh air from the outside of the unit
                   must be provided. All other windows of the development and all bathroom
                   windows may use any type of glazing and may be kept open as desired.
                d. In addition to the required STC ratings, the windows and glass doors shall
                   be installed in an acoustically-effective manner. To achieve an acoustically-
                   effective window and glass door construction, the sliding window and glass
                   door panels must form an air-tight seal when in the closed position and the
                   window and glass door frames must be caulked to the wall opening around
                   their entire perimeter with a non-hardening caulking compound to prevent
                   sound infiltration.
                e. The acoustical test report of all sound rated windows and glass doors should
                   be reviewed be a qualified acoustician to ensure that the chosen windows
                   and glass doors will adequately reduce traffic noise to acceptable levels.
                   Certification Letter – Prior to issuance of building permits, the applicant shall
                   submit a certification letter from the acoustical consultant verifying that the
                   building permit plans, as proposed, comply with the measures required by
                   the Noise Assessment Study for the Planned Townhouse Development,
                   Edward L. Pack Associates, Inc., May 12, 2016 and the applicable
                   requirements and standards of the General Plan Public Safety Element –
                   Noise. The applicant shall submit a subsequent Noise Assessment Study
                   and/or modify the building permit plans to meet the applicable requirements

                    and standards of the General Plan Public Safety Element – Noise if
                    determined necessary by the Director of Community Development.

61. Work Stoppage for Sensitive Cultural Resources – In the event sensitive cultural
    resources are identified, work shall stop.

                a. If deposits of prehistoric or historic archeological materials are encountered
                   during project construction activities, all work within an appropriate buffer
                   area around the discovery shall be stopped and a qualified archeologist
                   meeting federal criteria under 36 CFR 61 shall be contacted to assess the
                   deposit(s) and make recommendations.

                b. If deposits of prehistoric or historic archeological materials cannot be
                   avoided by project activities, the City Planning, Housing, and Economic
                   Development Department shall confirm that the project applicant(s) have
                   retained a qualified archaeologist to evaluate the potential historic
                   significance of the resource(s). If the deposits are determined to be
                   nonsignificant by a qualified archeologist, avoidance is not necessary. If the
                   deposits are determined to be significant by the qualified archeologist, the
                   resources shall be avoided if feasible. If avoidance is not feasible, project
                   impacts shall be mitigated in accordance with the recommendations of the
                   qualified archaeologist, in coordination with the City Planning, Housing, and
                   Economic Development Department and CEQA Guidelines Section15126.4
                   (b)(3)(C), which requires implementation of a data recovery plan.

                c. The data recovery plan shall include provisions for adequately recovering all
                   scientifically consequential information from and about any discovered
                   archeological materials and include recommendations for the treatment of
                   these resources. In-place preservation of the archeological resource is the
                   preferred manner of mitigating potential impacts, as it maintains the
                   relationship between the resource and the archeological context. In place
                   preservation also reduces the potential for conflicts with the religious or
                   cultural values of groups associated with the resource. Other mitigation
                   options include, but are not limited to, the full or partial removal and curation
                   of the resource.

                d. The City Planning, Housing, and Economic Development Department shall
                   confirm that the project applicant(s) have retained a qualified archeologist
                   for the preparation and implementation of the data recovery plan, which shall
                   be conducted by prior to any additional earth-moving activities in the area of
                   the resource. The recovery plan shall be submitted to the project applicant,
                   the City Planning, Housing, and Economic Development Department, and
                   the NWIC. Once the recovery plan is reviewed and approved by the City
                   Planning, Housing, and Economic Development Department and any
                   appropriate resource recovery completed, project construction activity within
                   the area of the find may resume. A data recovery plan shall not be required
                   for resources that have been deemed by the NWIC as adequately recorded
                   and recovered by studies already completed. (General Plan Mitigation

62. Training for Cultural Resources – Prior to the issuance of grading permits within the
    plan area, the City Planning, Housing, and Economic Development Department shall
    confirm that any development applicant has required all construction crews to undergo
    adequate training for the identification of federal or state-eligible cultural resources, and
    that the construction crews are aware of the potential for previously undiscovered
    archaeological resources within the plan area, of the laws protecting these resources
    and associated penalties, and of the procedures to follow should they discover cultural
    resources during project related work. To the extent that individual development projects
    are found to have the potential to disturb or destroy archaeological resources,
    subsequent environmental documentation may be required, including mitigation
    measures to address any identified significant impacts. (General Plan Mitigation
    Measure 4.5-1b)

63. Sensitive Paleontological Resources – Prior to the issuance of grading or demolition
    permits, the applicant shall retain a qualified paleontologist to assess individual
    development project proposals within the plan area for the potential to destroy unique
    paleontological resources. The City Planning, Housing and Economic Development
    Department shall require development proposals entailing significant earthworks or deep
    foundations with the potential to penetrate sedimentary rock layers to incorporate a study
    by a professional paleontologist to assess the potential for damage of paleontological
    resources. Should the paleontologist determine that the proposal has the potential to
    damage resources, the study shall include detailed provisions for the protection of these
    resources to the City Planning, Housing, and Economic Development Department.
    These provisions may include the complete avoidance of the resource, in-place
    preservation, and/or complete data recovery as discussed in General Plan Mitigation
    Measure 4.5-1a. (General Plan Mitigation Measure 4.5-2)

64. Work Stoppage for Sensitive Cultural Resources – In the event previously
    undiscovered human remains are identified, work shall stop.

                a. For future development projects permitted by the City under the New
                   General Plan, if human remains are encountered during ground-disturbing
                   activities within specific project sites, the project contractor and/or on-site
                   supervisor shall provide certification to City Planning, Housing, and
                   Economic Development Department that work within 50 feet of the discovery
                   is stopped. The project contractor shall immediately notify the San Mateo
                   County Coroner (Coroner) upon the discovery of any human remains. At the
                   same time, a qualified archaeologist meeting federal criteria under 36 CFR
                   61 shall be contacted by the project applicant(s) and project contractor, in
                   coordination with the City Planning, Housing, and Economic Development
                   Department to assess the situation and consult with the appropriate
                   agencies. If the human remains are of Native American origin, the Coroner
                   shall notify the NAHC within 24 hours of this identification. The NAHC will
                   identify a Most Likely Descendant (MLD) to inspect the site and provide
                   recommendations for the proper treatment or disposition, with proper dignity,
                   of the remains and any associated grave goods. Upon completion of the
                   assessment, the qualified archaeologist shall prepare a report documenting
                   the background to the finds, and providing recommendations for the

                    treatment of the human remains and any associated cultural materials, as
                    appropriate and in coordination with the recommendations of the MLD. The
                    report shall be submitted to the project applicant, the City Planning
                    Department, and the NWIC. Once the report is reviewed and approved by
                    the City Planning Department, and any appropriate treatment completed,
                    project construction activity within the area of the find may resume.

                b. If the MLD does not make recommendations within 48 hours the project
                   applicant(s) shall reinter the remains in an area of the property secure from
                   further disturbance. If the project applicant(s) does not accept the MLD‘s
                   recommendations, the applicant(s) or the MLD may request mediation by
                   the NAHC. (Mitigation Measure 4.5-3a)

65. Training for Cultural, Previously Undiscovered Archaeological, and Human
    Remains Resources – Prior to the issuance of grading permits within the plan area, the
    City Planning, Housing, and Economic Development Department shall confirm that any
    development applicant has required all construction crews to undergo a training session
    to inform them of the presence and nature of federal or state-eligible cultural resources
    and the potential for previously undiscovered archaeological resources and human
    remains within the project area, of the laws protecting these resources and associated
    penalties, and of the procedures to follow should they discover cultural resources during
    project-related work. (Mitigation Measure 4.5-3b)

Memo
To:        Application No.s PD2016-122 and TM2015-008
From:      Jennifer Savage, Contract Senior Planner
Date:      January 12, 2017
Re:        CEQA Exemption for the Proposed Residential Development at 910 Woodside Road



1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The applicant, Valera Fooksman, proposes construction of a new 3-story, multi-family building
located at 910 Woodside Road. The project would consist of 10 for-sale residential
condominiums with two-car garages, a total floor area of 25,155 square feet, and a maximum
building height of 37 feet 1 ½ inches. The project would provide onsite bike lockers for a
minimum of four bikes and two bike racks on the public sidewalk. The two existing parcels
would be combined to create the proposed project site.

The existing 1,626 square foot restaurant would be demolished. The project would front
Woodside Road with site access from Woodside Road. The project entails offsite improvements,
including construction of new sidewalks, street trees, and public benches.

Requested project permits include an Architectural Permit, Tentative Map, and a Condo
Permit/Planned Development Permit. The Planning Commission is authorized to take action
on the Condo Permit/Planned Development Permit, and would review the Tentative Map
concurrently.

2.0 CEQA EXEMPTION – SECTION 15183
CEQA mandates that projects that are consistent with the development density established by
existing zoning, community plan, or general plan policies for which an EIR was certified shall
not require additional environmental review, except as might be necessary to examine whether
there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site. As
proposed, the project is exempt from additional environmental review per Section 15183,
“Projects Consistent with a Community Plan or Zoning,” because the project meets the
following conditions:

        (1) The project is consistent with:
               a. A community plan adopted as part of a general plan,
                                           Page 1 of 5
b. A zoning action which zoned or designated the parcel on which the project
   would be located to accommodate a particular density of development, or

   In compliance with the policies and implementation measures specified in the
   General Plan, the City of Redwood City adopted a zoning action on April 8,
   2013 to establish a Mixed Use Neighborhood District Zoning Ordinance
   Amendment. The project is located in the Mixed Use Neighborhood (MUN)
   Zoning District. The MUN district established the maximum density to 40
   dwelling units per acre in a residential only project. Maximum height is
   limited to 3 stories/40 feet. The project would provide 10 dwelling units on
   land area of 13,349 square feet, which provides a residential density of 32.6
   dwelling units per acre, less than the maximum residential density. The
   project would create a three story, 37 feet 1 ½ inch high building, which does
   not exceed the number of stories or height limits for the district. Therefore,
   the project is consistent with the particular density and intensity of
   development of the zoning action Mixed Use Neighborhood District Zoning
   Ordinance Amendment.

c. A general plan of a local agency, and

   The City Council of Redwood City adopted by resolution a comprehensive
   update of the Redwood City General Plan on October 11, 2010. The New
   General Plan for Redwood City designates the property within the Mixed Use
   Neighborhood land use category. The Mixed Use Neighborhood Development
   Standards limit single use residential density to 40 dwelling units per acre
   and maximum height to three stories. The project would provide 32.6
   dwelling units per acre, less than the maximum residential density. The
   project would create a three story, 37 feet 1 ½ inch high building, which does
   not exceed the height limit. Therefore, the project is consistent with the Mixed
   Use neighborhood land use designation and General Plan for Redwood City in
   terms of density

   The General Plan land use designation for the property is Mixed Use -
   Neighborhood (MU-N). The city’s vision for Woodside Road “… is an
   attractive, walkable residential boulevard with mixed-use nodes that
   residents can easily walk to . . . [and] is an ideal area for new residential
   development . . .” The vision states that “infill residential development should
   incorporate landscaped setbacks while emphasizing the pedestrian
   orientation of frontages in site and building design.” The project would
   provide a residential development near a grocery store and bus stops, and
   provide new street trees and widened sidewalks.

   The project is subject to and complies with General Plan Goals, Polices, and
   Programs, including but not limited to:

   § Policy BE-1.8: Require that new projects are integrated as seamlessly as
     possible into surrounding development, creating extensions of urban
     fabric.
                             Page 2 of 5
§ Policy BE-3.5: Require building and site frontages that define public
  streets with high quality architectural and landscape design, including
  small-scale architectural elements and plane changes.
§ Goal BE-11: Create memorable and engaging retail, residential, and mixed-
  use destinations and paths along the corridors.
§ Policy BE-11.1: Improve the corridors to create a network of “complete
  streets” that emphasized pedestrian orientation and safety, public transit
  access, safe bicycle movement, and other improvements.
§ Policy BE-11.5: Improve public streetscapes along the corridors, including
  widened sidewalks and crosswalks, protected crosswalks, regular street
  tree planting, bus shelters and street furniture, and pedestrian-oriented
  street lighting.
§ Policy BE-11.7: Provide the appropriate density and intensity of land uses
  to facilitate high levels of transit use along corridors.
§ Policy BE-11.8: Ensure that buildings along corridors are sensitive to
  adjacent neighborhoods, providing adequate scale transitions.
§ Goal BE-13: Enhance the Woodside Road Corridor as an attractive
  residential boulevard with walkable mixed-use neighborhood centers, a
  pedestrian and transit-oriented character, and consistent design elements
  that unify its image.
§ Policy BE-13.4: Support new higher-density residential development on
  Woodside Road, while ensuring that new development is sensitive to
  adjacent single-unit residential neighborhoods.
§ Policy BE-23.7: Promote higher residential densities at locations near or
  within commercial, financial, and compatible employment, and also
  transportation corridors where neighborhood services are available.
§ Policy PS-13.10: Do not allow new residential or other noise sensitive land
  use development in noise impacted areas unless effective mitigation
  measures are incorporated into the project design to reduce outdoor
  activity area noise levels.
§ Program PS-61: Acoustical Analyses. Require acoustical analyses, as
  appropriate, for proposed stand-alone residential development within the
  60dB CNEL or higher contour, as shown in Figure PS-12. Require
  incorporation of mitigation measures as necessary to reduce noise levels
  to levels deemed appropriate by the City.

The proposed project is a residential building that would provide for-sale
housing in close proximity to goods and services, and transportation. The site
is within walking distance to a grocery store, cafes, and restaurants, and
services such as a salon and dry cleaner. The site is near bus lines (routes 72,
275, and 278).

The project is designed with ground floor entries facing Woodside Road and
one driveway entrance to minimize the disruption of the pedestrian way.
Pedestrian-scale design features include a widened sidewalk, pedestrian site
lighting, street trees, and public benches. The project provides a higher
density development along a corridor while respecting existing adjacent
multi-family by providing step backs in the design.

           The property in located in the noise contours for 60-65, 65-70, and 70-75
           db(A) (Figure PS-11: 2010 Existing Noise Contours). The applicant provided
           a Noise Assessment in compliance with General Plan policies and programs.
           The project includes design measures to reduce the noise levels to acceptable
           levels and the project would be conditioned to provide these design measures
           as part of the project’s construction methods.

           As designed, the project would be consistent with the City’s General Plan and
           meet this condition.

(2) An EIR was certified by the lead agency for the zoning action, the community plan, or
    the general plan.

   The City Council of Redwood City certified the FEIR for the New General Plan for
   Redwood City on October 11, 2010. The City of Redwood City determined that the
   scope of environmental impact associated with the zoning action, Mixed Use
   Neighborhood District Zoning Ordinance Amendment, was fully and adequately
   addressed in the 2010 FEIR for the New General Plan for Redwood City.

(3) There are no project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its
    site.

   The project is consistent with the land use designation and zoning for the site, and
   there is nothing peculiar about this project or its location that would result in new or
   substantially more severe effects than those identified in the 2010 FEIR, such as
   population growth and an increase in traffic. There are no new circumstances or new
   information relating to the project or its vicinity that would change the conclusions
   of the 2010 FEIR. No substantial capital improvement projects or private
   development projects are nearby. Nor is there new information relating to the
   property or its vicinity that would change the conclusions of the 2010 FEIR.

   The proposed project would not result in transportation impacts greater than those
   analyzed in the 2010 FEIR. The project is expected to result in a reduction of 148
   ADT, an increase of 6 AM peak hour trips, and a reduction of 17 PM peak hour trips.
   No Traffic Impact Analysis report is required for the subject project because the
   project would generate less than 100 net new peak hour trips, and would not create
   impacts greater than those certified by City Council in the 2010 FEIR.

   The site currently contains a one-story restaurant and surface parking. Similar to the
   adjacent multifamily, residential use sites, the subject site is flat and located in an
   urban context surrounded with a mix of multifamily and commercial uses.
   Multifamily residential uses are located to the west and south, and across Woodside
   Road to the east. There is a two-story multifamily residential building to the west, a
   four-story multifamily residential building to the south, and a five-story multifamily
   residential building to the east. Commercial uses are located to the north and east,
   including a partial two-story dental office and gas station with convenience store.
   There are existing shade and ornamental trees (London Plane, Callery pear,
   Hollywood juniper, and Crepe Myrtle) on the border of the property, which were
                                     Page 4 of 5
          found to be in fair to excellent condition. There is nothing peculiar about the site
          that could result in previously unidentified impacts.

3.0 CONCLUSION

The City conducted a review of the project and its impacts to determine whether it is exempt
from CEQA. Based on the discussion and analysis above, no significant impacts were identified
and the project is exempt from CEQA under Section 15183.

                                  To the Redwood City Planning Commission
                                                        From Planning Staff

January 17, 2017

SUBJECT
Request by Greystar Development for a Downtown Planned Community Permit
including two (2) guideline deviations (DPC2015-12), a Tentative Map (TM2015-09),
and an Affordable Housing Plan to construct an 8-story building with 350 apartment
units (including 35 affordable units at the low income level), 1,400 sq. ft. of ground floor
retail space, and three levels of underground parking, located at 1409 El Camino Real

RECOMMENDATION
Adopt Resolution 16-20, finding the project consistent with the Downtown Precise Plan
EIR and approving the Downtown Planned Community Permit (DPC2015-12),
Tentative Map (TM2015-09), and Affordable Housing Plan for a new 8-story, 350-unit
residential building (including 35 affordable units at the low income level) and 1,400 sq.
ft. of ground floor retail located at 1409 El Camino Real, based on the findings and
subject to the conditions of approval contained therein.

BACKGROUND
The applicant, Greystar Development, submitted the subject application in December of
2015. After the project was deemed complete, the Architectural Advisory Committee
(ACC) reviewed it on July 7, 2016 to consider the four (4) requested guideline
deviations. The AAC recommended approval of two (2) guideline deviations on the
maximum length establishment and use of permeable pavers and denial of the
remaining two (2) deviations on the garage column locations and wing depth. The AAC
also recommended that the project incorporate more articulation, vertically and
horizontally, to reduce the building’s scale and to provide a change in form from the
adjacent development at 1305 El Camino Real (currently under construction).

Based on the AAC’s recommended denial of the two deviations, the applicant revised
their plans so that they are no longer seeking deviations on the parking layout and
disposition type. The applicant revised the garage column locations to comply with the
guidelines and changed the building disposition type from Courtyard to Rear Yard
instead of reducing the wing depth. In addition, the applicant modified the building’s
exterior to soften its visual appearance including a more asymmetric design,
transparency, articulation, and revised colors and materials.

On November 1, 2016, the Planning Commission (Commission) considered the
proposal. While the Commission was supportive of the project’s design and features,
including the provision of onsite affordable housing units at the low-income level, mixed
use, and site amenities, it shared the AAC’s desire to physically break-up the building’s
mass and scale, and provide variation from the adjacent development at 1305 El
Camino Real. The Commission continued the matter to allow the applicant to revise the
plans by providing physical variation in the building façade fronting El Camino Real,
vertically and horizontally. A majority of the Commission generally supported locating
units on the ground floor fronting the boulevard with entry stoops provided that it
resulted in breaking up the building’s mass and uniform height (Design Alternative 4, as
presented at the November 2016 meeting). While not recommended, the Commission
also asked staff to determine whether Design Alternative 1 (with increased upper story
setbacks, also presented at the November 2016 meeting) could be allowed. See staff’s
analysis attached to this report (Attachment 2).

The applicant responded to the Planning Commission’s comments with the following
project revisions (summarized below and further detailed in the attached summary of
revisions, prepared by the applicant, Attachment 3):

     1.   Converted 4,500 sq. ft. of retail space at the southern corner into four units
          with entry stoops;
     2.   Provided planters adjacent to the entry stoops;
     3.   Revised the sidewalk planters to brick pavers to allow wider sidewalks (at the
          City’s direction);
     4.   Changed the colors, materials, articulation, and roof form of the southern
          building element;
     5.   Broke-up the red brick colonnade at the northern corner, and
     6.   Lowered the height of the southern corner by one story.

ANALYSIS
Staff Analysis of the Project Revisions
The revised design is an overall improvement to the Project and provides varied
heights and forms along the project frontage. The introduction of the ground floor
stoops helps to create interest and variety for the pedestrian experience, and
differentiates this project from the adjacent project at 1305 El Camino Real. The
change in roof height at the south corner helps to visually break-up the building forms.
The applicant also maintained a small portion of ground floor retail at the north corner
of the building. The Commission may also consider whether additional ground floor
retail is appropriate (see Alternatives section, below).

DTPP Standards Review:
Staff has reviewed the revised proposal for compliance with the applicable regulations
in the DTPP, and has determined that all applicable standards fall within the range
allowed (see Table 1, below). The project is located within the Downtown General
zone, which allows residential uses (including on the ground floor), and ground floor
neighborhood retail. On the El Camino Real frontage, the revised plan maintains
ground floor neighborhood retail at the north end, and incorporates ground floor
residential with entry stoops at the south end. Changes based on the revised proposal
are highlighted in red in the table below. Note that the vehicle and bicycle parking
requirements have changed based on conversion of retail to residential uses on the
ground floor. As revised, the project still complies.
