Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Samaritan
Medical Campus Development Plan on Samaritan Drive in San Jose, California. The project
proposes a total of 475,250 square feet (s.f.) of medical office space on two sites. One site is
located on Samaritan Court and the other site is located across the street from Samaritan Court on
the north side of Samaritan Drive. The Samaritan Court site is partially occupied by an 18,064 s.f.
single-story medical office building that would be removed. The site on the north side of Samaritan
Drive has single-story medical office buildings totaling 92,460 s.f. that also would be removed as
part of the project. The amount of existing medical office space to be removed totals 110,524 s.f.
Thus, the project would result in a net increase of 364,726 s.f. of medical office space. All
associated parking would be provided on-site. As proposed, access to the sites would be provided
via Samaritan Drive.
A reduced project alternative traffic scenario was prepared that only analyzes the effects of
replacing the 18,064 s.f. medical office building on the Samaritan Court site with 115,250 s.f. of
medical office space, resulting in a net increase of 97,186 s.f. of medical office space. This project
alternative is being analyzed at the request of the City of San Jose, since development of the
Samaritan Court site could potentially occur in advance of the additional development on the north
side of Samaritan Drive.
The potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards
and methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose, City of Campbell, Town of Los Gatos, and the
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion
Management Program (CMP). According to the VTA TIA guidelines, a CMP intersection shall be
included in the traffic impact analysis if the proposed development project is expected to add 10 or
more peak hour vehicles per lane to any intersection movement. The same criterion was used to
identify non-CMP intersections to be included in this study. The study includes an analysis of AM
and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 17 signalized intersections, 4 unsignalized intersections,
and 8 freeway segments.

Project Trip Generation
After applying ITE Trip Generation Manual rates and the existing site trip credits, the Samaritan
Medical Campus Development Plan would generate 14,167 new daily vehicle trips, with 834 new
trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 1,398 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour.
Using the inbound/outbound splits published in ITE Trip Generation Manual, the project would
produce 655 new inbound and 179 new outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 400 new
inbound and 998 new outbound trips during the PM peak hour.
The reduced project alternative is estimated to generate 3,734 new daily vehicle trips, with 232 new
trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 368 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour.
Using the inbound/outbound splits published in ITE Trip Generation Manual, the project would
produce 183 new inbound and 49 new outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 106 new
inbound and 262 new outbound trips during the PM peak hour.
                                                                                               Page | ii

Background Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but four of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable
level of service (LOS D or better) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background
plus project conditions. The following City of San Jose study intersections would operate at an
unacceptable level of service (LOS E):

City of San Jose Intersections
    (1)    Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the AM peak hour
    (4)    Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (10)   Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13)   Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM
peak hours of traffic under background plus project conditions.

Intersection Impacts
When measured against the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, and CMP significant impact
criteria, the following three intersections would be significantly impacted by the project:

(4) Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive
SJ Impact:       The intersection would operate at LOS D during the PM peak hour under
                 background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause
                 the intersection level of service to degrade to LOS E. Based on the City of San
                 Jose level of service impact criteria, this constitutes a significant project impact.
Mitigation:      The level of service impact at this intersection could be mitigated by adding a third
                 northbound through lane on Bascom Avenue. This improvement would require
                 restriping and signal modifications to install a new detector loop and signal head for
                 the new northbound lane. The proposed improvement would improve the level of
                 service at the intersection to an acceptable LOS D and would satisfactorily mitigate
                 the significant project impact.

(10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue
SJ Impact:       The intersection would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour under
                 background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause
                 the average critical delay at the intersection to increase by 5.0 seconds (more than
                 the 4.0 second threshold) and cause the V/C ratio to increase by 0.037 (more than
                 the 0.01 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of service impact criteria,
                 this constitutes a significant project impact.
Mitigation:      The level of service impact at this intersection could be mitigated by adding a
                 second westbound left-turn lane on Camden Avenue. However, this improvement
                 would require roadway widening which is not feasible. Widening Camden Avenue
                 would require right-of-way (ROW) acquisition, which would negatively impact
                 multiple properties. In addition, existing pedestrian facilities and future bicycle
                 facilities that are planned along Camden Avenue also would be negatively affected,
                 which conflicts with the goals and policies contained in the City’s General Plan for
                 this City-designated Transit Corridor. For these reasons, it can be concluded that


                                                                                       Page | iii 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                         May 5, 2016

                there are no feasible physical improvements that can be implemented to mitigate
                the impact at the Union Avenue/Camden Avenue intersection. Therefore, this
                intersection impact must be considered significant and unavoidable.
                Since physical improvements aimed at increasing the capacity of the intersection
                are not feasible due to roadway width limitations, the intersection of Union
                Avenue/Camden Avenue is proposed to be added to the City of San Jose’s list of
                Protected Intersections. As such, in lieu of physical improvements the project
                would be required to construct offsetting improvements to other parts of the
                citywide transportation system to improve system-wide roadway capacity or to
                enhance non-auto travel modes in furtherance of the General Plan goals and
                policies. Ideally, offsetting improvements should be implemented in the
                neighborhoods surrounding the project site and/or in the neighborhoods
                surrounding the protected intersection. Note that the project also would be required
                to lengthen the westbound left-turn pocket at the intersection, which would increase
                the queuing capacity. However, neither the offsetting improvements nor the
                increased vehicle queuing capacity would mitigate the significant impact. Thus, the
                intersection impact would remain significant and unavoidable.

(13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road
SJ Impact:      The intersection would operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour under
                background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause
                the average critical delay at the intersection to increase by 10.9 seconds (more
                than the 4.0 second threshold) and cause the V/C ratio to increase by 0.039 (more
                than the 0.01 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of service impact
                criteria, this constitutes a significant project impact.
Mitigation:     The level of service impact at this intersection could be mitigated by widening the
                westbound shared through/right-turn lane on Los Gatos-Almaden Road to allow for
                a separate right-turn movement onto northbound Union Avenue. In order to widen
                the shared through/right-turn lane, the lanes on the westbound approach of the
                intersection would need to be shifted approximately two feet to the south. This
                would require relocation of the detector loops and lane restriping. The eastbound
                left-turn lane would need to be realigned with the westbound left-turn lane, which
                would require restriping only. The proposed improvements would improve the level
                of service at the intersection to an acceptable LOS D and would satisfactorily
                mitigate the significant project impact.

Project Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
Traffic volumes on the study freeway segments were estimated by adding project trips to the
existing volumes obtained from the 2012 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results of the
freeway segment analysis show that the project would cause significant increases in traffic volumes
(one percent or more of freeway capacity) on four of the study freeway segments currently
operating at LOS F, and would also cause the level of service on one freeway segment to degrade
from LOS E to LOS F.
Based on CMP freeway impact criteria, the following study freeway segments would be significantly
impacted by the project:
    Northbound SR 85, between Camden Avenue and Union Avenue – AM peak hour
    Northbound SR 85, between Union Avenue and Bascom Avenue – AM peak hour
    Southbound SR 85, between Bascom Avenue and Union Avenue – PM peak hour
    Southbound SR 85, between SR 17 and Bascom Avenue – PM peak hour
    Southbound SR 85, between Winchester Boulevard and SR 17 – PM peak hour

                                                                                    Page | iv 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                             May 5, 2016

The results of the freeway segment analysis show that the reduced project alternative would cause
the level of service on one freeway segment to degrade from LOS E to LOS F. Based on CMP
freeway impact criteria, the following study freeway segment would be significantly impacted by the
reduced project alternative:
    Southbound SR 85, between Winchester Boulevard and SR 17 – PM peak hour
Mitigation of significant project impacts on freeway segments would require roadway widening to
construct additional through lanes, thereby increasing freeway capacity. Since it is not feasible for
an individual development project to bear responsibility for implementing such extensive
transportation system improvements due to constraints in acquisition and cost of right-of-way, and
no comprehensive project to add through lanes has been developed by Caltrans or VTA for
individual projects to contribute to, the significant impacts on the directional freeway segments
identified above must be considered significant and unavoidable.

Project Alternative Intersection LOS Analysis
San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but three of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable
level of service (LOS D or better) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background
plus project alternative conditions. The following City of San Jose study intersections would operate
at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E):

City of San Jose Intersections
    (1) Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the AM peak hour
    (10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection analysis show that, measured against the CMP level of service
standards, all of the CMP study intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS E or better
during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background plus project alternative conditions.

Project Alternative Intersection Impacts
When measured against the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, and CMP significant impact
criteria, none of the study intersections would be significantly impacted by the project alternative.

Cumulative Intersection Level of Service Analysis
San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of
Los Gatos level of service standards, all but five of the study intersections would operate at an
acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under
cumulative conditions. The following City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos study intersections
would operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E):

City of San Jose Intersections
    (1)    Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during AM and PM peak hours
    (4)    Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (10)   Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13)   Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour



                                                                                         Page | v

Town of Los Gatos Intersections
    (16) Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under cumulative conditions show that, measured
against the CMP standards, all but two CMP intersections would operate at an acceptable level of
service (LOS E or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The following CMP
intersections, located in the City of Campbell, would operate at LOS F during at least one of the
peak hours of traffic under cumulative conditions:
    (14) SR 17 SB Ramps and San Tomas Expwy – LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours
    (15) SR 17 NB Ramps and Camden Avenue – LOS F during the AM peak hour

Cumulative Intersection Impacts
The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos and CMP level of
service impact criteria, the estimated cumulative project trips collectively would create a significant
adverse traffic impact at the following study intersections:
    (1)    Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – City of San Jose Impact
    (4)    Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive (CMP) – City of San Jose Impact
    (10)   Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – City of San Jose Impact
    (13)   Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – City of San Jose Impact
    (14)   SR 17 SB Ramps and San Tomas Expressway – City of Campbell / CMP Impact
    (15)   SR 17 NB Ramps and Camden Avenue – City of Campbell / CMP Impact
    (16)   Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue – Town of Los Gatos Impact

Project Contribution to Cumulative Impacts
The Samaritan Medical Campus Development project would contribute a considerable amount of
traffic (more than 25 percent) to the following three cumulatively impacted intersections:
    (4)    Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive
    (10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue
    (13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road
The mitigation that has been proposed to address the impact at intersection (13) above under
background plus project conditions (see Chapter 5) also would be effective at mitigating the
cumulative traffic impact. The cumulative traffic impacts at intersections (4) and (10), however, are
considered significant and unavoidable.
The Samaritan Medical Campus Development project would not contribute a considerable amount
of traffic (more than 25 percent) to any other cumulatively impacted intersection.
Table ES-1 shows the results of the intersection level of service analysis. The results of the freeway
level of service analysis are contained in Table ES-2.

Other Transportation Facilities
The project would not have an adverse effect on existing transit, bicycle or pedestrian facilities in
the study area. City staff have indicated, however, that the Samaritan Medical Campus
Development project will likely be required to implement the following intersection improvements as
part of the project conditions of approval.




                                                                                      Page | vi

Kinghurst Drive and Samaritan Drive
In an effort to improve pedestrian safety at the Kinghurst Drive/Samaritan Drive intersection and
enhance the pedestrian connection between the medical offices and the residential neighborhood
to the south, City of San Jose staff intends to condition the Samaritan project to modify the
southwest and southeast corners of this intersection to include bulb-outs. In addition, the City plans
to condition the project to straighten the existing crosswalk on Samaritan Drive so that it is
perpendicular to Samaritan Drive. This would entail relocating the ADA accessible curb ramp on the
north side of Samaritan Drive. Together, these improvements would help to slow down vehicles
entering and exiting Kinghurst Drive, make pedestrians more visible to drivers, and reduce the
pedestrian crossing distances, thereby creating a safer pedestrian environment at this intersection.

Signal Warrants
Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive
The peak hour signal warrant check (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4, Warrant 3) was performed for
the intersection of Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive. The analysis revealed that the signal
warrant currently is not satisfied, but would be satisfied under background plus project conditions.
The signal warrant would also be satisfied with the development of Samaritan Court only (project
alternative conditions).
The Samaritan Medical Campus Development project would install a new traffic signal at this
location. Improvements would include adding a fourth leg (southbound leg) to the intersection,
converting the existing two-way left-turn lane on Samaritan Drive into dedicated eastbound and
westbound left-turn pockets with protected left-turn phasing, and adding crosswalks with pedestrian
signal heads on Samaritan Drive.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Samaritan
Medical Campus Development Plan on Samaritan Drive in San Jose, California. The project proposes a
total of 475,250 square feet (s.f.) of medical office space on two sites. One site is located on Samaritan
Court and the other site is located across the street from Samaritan Court on the north side of Samaritan
Drive. The Samaritan Court site is partially occupied by a 18,064 s.f. single-story medical office building
that would be removed. The site on the north side of Samaritan Drive has single-story medical office
buildings totaling 92,460 s.f. that also would be removed as part of the project. The amount of existing
medical office space to be removed totals 110,524 s.f. Thus, the project would result in a net increase of
364,726 s.f. of medical office space. All associated parking would be provided on-site. As proposed,
access to the sites would be provided via Samaritan Drive. The project site location and the surrounding
study area are shown on Figure 1.
A reduced project alternative traffic scenario was prepared that only analyzes the effects of replacing the
18,064 s.f. medical office building on the Samaritan Court site with 115,250 s.f. of medical office space,
resulting in a net increase of 97,186 s.f. of medical office space. This project alternative is being analyzed
at the request of the City of San Jose, since development of the Samaritan Court site could potentially
occur in advance of the additional development on the north side of Samaritan Drive. The results of the
project alternative analysis are contained in Chapter 6.

Scope of Study
The potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose, City of Campbell, Town of Los Gatos, and the Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management
Program (CMP). According to the VTA TIA guidelines, a CMP intersection shall be included in the traffic
impact analysis if the proposed development project is expected to add 10 or more peak hour vehicles
per lane to any intersection movement. The same criterion was used to identify non-CMP intersections to
be included in this study. The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 17
signalized intersections and 4 unsignalized intersections. The study also analyzes 8 freeway segments.

In summary, the study includes the analysis of 9 signalized intersections and 4 unsignalized intersections
within the City of San Jose, 2 signalized intersections within the City of Campbell, and 6 signalized
intersections within the Town of Los Gatos. The 6 CMP signalized intersections located within San Jose
and Los Gatos were evaluated against the standards of both the local jurisdictions and the Santa Clara
County CMP. The two CMP study intersections located in the City of Campbell required evaluation
according to CMP standards only. The study also evaluated 8 freeway segments per CMP guidelines.
Traffic conditions at the intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak hour is typically
between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on
an average weekday. Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
Scenario 1:     Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from the City of San Jose,
                VTA, and new 2014, 2015 and 2016 manual turning movement counts. New traffic count
                data are contained in Appendix A.
Scenario 2:     Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes were
                estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                project. Existing Plus Project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                order to determine the effects the project would have on the existing roadway network.
Scenario 3:     Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing
                peak-hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet constructed and
                occupied developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet completed
                developments within the City of San Jose was provided by City of San Jose staff in the
                form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI). The City of San Jose ATI is included in
                Appendix B. Town of Los Gatos staff provided project information for approved but not yet
                completed developments within Los Gatos.

Scenario 4:     Background Plus Project Conditions. Projected near-term peak hour traffic volumes with
                the project were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the additional traffic
                generated by the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
                background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts according to the
                City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, and City of Campbell Level of Service Policy.
Scenario 5:     Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative traffic conditions were calculated by adding the traffic
                generated by pending developments to background plus project conditions. The lists of
                pending developments were provided by the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, and
                City of Campbell. This traffic scenario was evaluated in order to fulfill the CEQA and CMP
                requirements.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, Santa
Clara County Congestion Management Program (CMP), field observations, and new traffic counts. The
following data were obtained from these sources:
   existing traffic volumes
   intersection lane configurations
   signal timing and phasing
   approved and pending project trips

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are
described below.

Signalized Intersections
The level of service methodology in the City of San Jose, City of Campbell, and Town of Los Gatos is the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 method for signalized intersections. This method is applied using
the TRAFFIX software. The 2000 HCM operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations
on the basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the
CMP-designated intersection level of service methodology, the San Jose/Campbell/Los Gatos
methodology employs the CMP default values for the analysis parameters.
The City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS
D or better, whether or not the intersection is a CMP intersection. The City of Campbell level of service
standard for signalized non-CMP intersections is LOS D or better, and is LOS E or better for CMP
intersections. The correlation between average control delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.

CMP Intersections
The designated level of service methodology for the CMP also is the 2000 HCM operations method for
signalized intersections, using TRAFFIX. The CMP level of service standard for signalized intersections is
LOS E or better.

Unsignalized Intersections
For the unsignalized intersections, an assessment was made of the need for signalization. This
assessment was made based on the Peak-Hour Volume Signal Warrant described in the California

                                                                                                 Page |4

Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). This method makes no evaluation of intersection
level of service, but simply provides an indication whether peak-hour traffic volumes are, or would be,
sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal. Additional analysis may include unsignalized level of
service analysis and/or operational analysis such as evaluating vehicle queuing and delay. Other types of
traffic control devices, signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing field
conditions.

             cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures begin to appear.

             Operations with longer delays due to a combination of unfavorable
     D       progression, long cycle lengths or high V/C rations. Many vehicles stop and              35.1 to 55.0
             individual cycle failures are noticeable.

             Operations with high delay values indicating poor progression, long cycle

Intersection Operations
The analysis of intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of traffic operations for
intersections where the project would add a significant number of left turns. The operations analysis is
based on vehicle queuing for high demand left-turn movements at intersections. Vehicle queues were
estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of “n” vehicles for a
vehicle movement using the following formula:
         P (x n)       n e – ()
                              n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Average # of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-
turn storage requirements at signalized intersections.
                                                                                                         Page |5 
 Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                                         May 5, 2016 


The 95th percentile queue length value indicates that during the peak hour, a queue of this length or less
would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue length larger than the 95th percentile queue
would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a
60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-turn storage pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue
length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile
queue length is also known as the “design queue length.”

Freeway Segments
According to CMP guidelines, an analysis of freeway segment levels of service is required if a project is
estimated to add trips to a freeway segment equal to or greater than one percent of the capacity of that
segment. Since the number of project trips added to the freeways in the area is expected to be above the
one percent threshold, a detailed analysis of freeway segment levels of service was performed. As
prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated based
on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:
                   D = V / (N*S)
        where:
                   D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                   V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                   N= number of travel lanes
                   S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)
The vehicle density on a freeway segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 2. The CMP
specifies that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for mixed-flow lane
segments that are three lanes or wider in one direction, and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl be used for mixed-
flow lane segments that are two lanes wide in one direction. A capacity of 1,800 vphpl was used for high
occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments
as LOS E or better.

            Average operating speeds at the free-flow speed generally prevail. Vehicles are
    A                                                                                                        11.0 or less
            almost completely unimpeded in their ability to maneuver within the traffic stream.

            Speeds at the free-flow speed are generally maintained. The ability to maneuver
    B       within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted, and the general level of physical         11.1 to 18.0
            and psychological comfort provided to drivers is still high.

            Speeds at or near the free-flow speed of the freeway prevail. Freedom to maneuver
    C       within the traffic stream is noticeably restricted, and lane changes require more                18.1 to 26.0
            vigilance on the part of the driver.

            Speeds begin to decline slightly with increased flows at this level. Freedom to
    D       maneuver within the traffic stream is more noticeably limited, and the driver                    26.1 to 46.0
            experiences reduced physical and psychological comfort levels.

            At this level, the freeway operates at or near capacity. Operations in this level are
    E       volatile, because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic stream, leaving little       46.1 to 58.0
            room to maneuver within the traffic stream.

General Plan Transportation Policies
The Circulation Element of the Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan includes a set of balanced, long-
range, multi modal transportation goals and policies that provide for a transportation network that is safe,
efficient and sustainable (minimizes environmental, financial, and neighborhood impacts). These
transportation goals and policies are intended to improve multi-modal accessibility to all land uses and
create a city where people are less reliant on driving to meet their daily needs. San Jose’s Transportation
Goals, Policies and Actions aim to:

       Establish circulation policies that increase bicycle, pedestrian and transit travel while reducing
        motor vehicle trips to increase the City’s share of travel by alternative transportation modes; and
       Promote San Jose as a walking and bicycling-first city by providing and prioritizing funding for
        projects that enhance and improve bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

General Plan Amendment Long-Range Analysis
A General Plan Amendment (GPA) is being prepared for the medical office development that would occur
on the north side of Samaritan Drive as part of the proposed project. The City’s current adopted General
Plan land use designation for the northern site is Neighborhood/Community Commercial. The proposed
project involves changing the land use designation to Regional Commercial. Note that while the project
does not meet the criteria for an individual GPA long-range model run, using the City’s travel demand
forecasting model (TDF model), the proposed GPA will be included in the current Cumulative GPA model
run.
The Cumulative GPA analysis will address the long-range effects of all the currently proposed GPAs on
the transportation system through the use of citywide measures of effectiveness (MOEs) developed for
the Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan. The MOEs used to evaluate the Citywide transportation
network include Vehicle Miles Traveled, Journey-to-Work Mode Share, and Average Travel Speeds
within the City’s Transit Priority Corridors. Consistent with the City of San Jose policies and practice, the
City’s TDF model used to evaluate the long-range effects of all the proposed GPAs includes all major
transportation infrastructure identified in the Envision San Jose 2040 Land Use/Transportation Diagram,
including planned infrastructure that is not yet built and/or funded.

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the
vicinity of the site, including the roadway network, transit services, and bicycle and pedestrian
facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via I-880 and SR 85. These facilities are described
below.
SR-85 is a six-lane freeway in the vicinity of the site. It extends north from its starting point at US-
101 in South San Jose to where it ends in Mountain View, where it again joins with US-101. Access
to the site is provided via its interchanges with Bascom Avenue and Union Avenue.
SR-17 is a four- to eight-lane freeway in the vicinity of the site. It extends south to Santa Cruz and
north to I-280 in San Jose, at which point it makes a transition into I-880 to Oakland. Access to the
site is provided via its interchange with Lark Avenue.
Local access to the site is provided by Bascom Avenue, Los Gatos Boulevard, Union Avenue, Lark
Avenue, Camden Avenue, and Samaritan Drive. These roadways are described below.
Bascom Avenue is a four- to six-lane north-south roadway in the vicinity of the project. It extends
from Santa Clara southward to Los Gatos, at which point it makes a transition into Los Gatos
Boulevard. Access to the site is provided via Samaritan Drive.
Los Gatos Boulevard is a four- to six-lane north-south roadway in the vicinity of the project. It
extends from Los Gatos northward to San Jose, at which point it makes a transition into Bascom
Avenue. Access to the site is provided via Samaritan Drive.
Union Avenue is a two- to four-lane north-south roadway that extends from Campbell to Los Gatos,
where it terminates at Blossom Hill Road. Access to the site is provided via Samaritan Drive.
Lark Avenue is a four- to six-lane east-west roadway that runs between Winchester Boulevard and
Los Gatos Boulevard in Los Gatos. Direct access to SR17 is provided via an interchange.
Camden Avenue is a four- to six-lane northwesterly-southeasterly roadway that runs from San Jose
to Campbell, at which point it makes a transition into San Tomas Expressway.
Samaritan Drive is a two- to four-lane east-west roadway that provides direct access to the project
site via Samaritan Court. The roadway extends from Bascom Avenue/Los Gatos Boulevard
eastward to Union Avenue, at which point it terminates.
Samaritan Court can be accessed via Samaritan Drive only. It is located on the south side of
Samaritan Drive and provides access to an existing single-story medical office building.

                                                                                            Page |8

Kinghurst Drive is a residential street that extends from Samaritan Drive south to Carlton Avenue.
Kinghurst Drive cul-du-sacs just south of Carlton Avenue as it transitions into Campanula Place.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
There are no county designated bike lanes in the vicinity of the project site. Currently, westbound
Samaritan Drive has a 5-foot striped lane that functions as a bike lane, but it is not an official Class
II bike lane as there are no signs to indicate a bike lane. There are, however, “No Stopping
Anytime” signs on westbound Samaritan Drive. According to the San Jose Bike Plan 2020 Bikeway
Network map, bike lanes are planned on Samaritan Drive, Bascom Avenue between Samaritan
Drive and White Oaks Avenue, and Camden Avenue between SR 17 and Leigh Avenue. These are
described in more detail in Chapter 7.
Pedestrian facilities in the project area consist primarily of sidewalks. Sidewalks are found along
virtually all previously described local roadways in the study area and along the local residential
streets and collectors near the site. At Samaritan Place, there is a pedestrian footbridge over SR-85
connecting Samaritan Place to White Oaks Avenue. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and
push buttons are located at all of the signalized intersections in the study area, as well as some
unsignalized intersections on Samaritan Drive.

Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the VTA. The VTA bus service is described
below and shown on Figure 2.
VTA Bus Service
Four bus lines serve the project site. The 27 line provides service between Santa Teresa Hospital
and Good Samaritan Hospital, with 30-minute headways during commute hours. The line 49
provides service between Los Gatos Civic Center and the Winchester Transit Center, with 30-
minute headways during commute hours. The 61 line provides service between Good Samaritan
Hospital and Sierra Road/Piedmont Road via Bascom Avenue, with 30-minute headways during
commute hours. The 62 line provides service between Good Samaritan Hospital and Sierra
Road/Piedmont Road via Union Avenue, with 30-minute headways during commute hours. Bus
stops for lines 27, 49, 61, and 62 are all located within walking distance of the project site.

Existing Traffic Volumes & Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the
field and are shown on Figure 3. Existing peak-hour traffic volumes were obtained from the CMP
TRAFFIX count database, City of San Jose TRAFFIX count database, Town of Los Gatos and new
peak-hour counts. The existing peak-hour intersection volumes are shown on Figure 4. Intersection
turning-movement counts conducted for this analysis are presented in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the existing intersection level of service analysis are summarized in Table 3.
San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but three of the signalized study intersections currently operate at an
acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The
following City of San Jose intersections currently operate at an unacceptable LOS E during either
the AM or PM peak hour as indicated below:
City of San Jose Intersections
    (1) Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – AM peak hour
    (10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – PM peak hour
    (13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – AM peak hour

                                                                                          Page |9

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of the CMP study
intersections located in San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell currently operate at an acceptable LOS
E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Existing Freeway Levels of Service
Traffic volumes for the study freeway segments were obtained from the 2012 CMP Annual
Monitoring Report, which contains the most recent data collected for freeway segments located in
Santa Clara County. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 4. The results show that
the following directional freeway segments currently operate at an unacceptable LOS F:

           SR 17, northbound between San Tomas/Camden and Hamilton – AM peak hour
           SR 85, northbound between Camden Avenue and Union Avenue – AM peak hour
           SR 85, northbound between Union Avenue and Bascom Avenue – AM peak hour
           SR 85, northbound between Bascom Avenue and SR 17 – AM peak hour
           SR 85, northbound between SR 17 and Winchester Boulevard – AM peak hour
           SR 85, southbound between Bascom Avenue and Union Avenue – PM peak hour
           SR 85, southbound between SR 17 and Bascom Avenue – PM peak hour

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and
to confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify
any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to intersection level of service, and (2)
to identify any locations where the level of service calculation does not accurately reflect level of

service in the field. Overall, the level of service analysis appears to accurately reflect actual existing
traffic conditions. However, field observations revealed some operational problems.

Bascom Avenue
In general, Bascom Avenue experiences heavy congestion during both the AM and PM peak hours
in both directions of travel. Between Samaritan Drive and the SR 85 ramps the congestion is
aggravated by the close spacing of several signalized intersections along the roadway. During the
PM peak hour, northbound through traffic queues up at the Samaritan Drive intersection and blocks
the northbound right turn movement onto Samaritan Drive. The southbound vehicle queue at the
Samaritan Drive intersection backs up to the SR 85 southbound ramps, and the northbound queues
at times back up for nearly a quarter mile. Though the lengthy queues are present, the signal
phasing serves all vehicles queued in the allotted green times.

Samaritan Drive
Observations show that Samaritan Drive at the intersection of Bascom Avenue has some
operational problems due to the close spacing of the intersection at National Avenue. During both
the AM and PM peak hours, westbound vehicle queues on Samaritan Drive at Bascom Avenue
often back up and block the intersection of National Avenue and Samaritan Drive. Northbound
vehicles on National Avenue that intend to turn left onto Samaritan Drive and then immediately turn
right onto northbound Bascom Avenue are forced to wait, resulting in some vehicle delays and
queuing on National Avenue.
The longest vehicle queue observed on National Avenue was 5 vehicles in length during the AM
peak hour and 6 vehicles in length during the PM peak hour. Because of the long delays, some
vehicles (about 10 to 15 percent of the total number of northbound left turns) turn right onto
eastbound Samaritan Drive and either make a u-turn or turn left into the parking lot on the north
side of Samaritan Drive and then turn back onto westbound Samaritan Drive. The wait time, or
delay, for the northbound left turn movement on National Avenue also was observed. The delay
ranges from just a few seconds to a maximum of about 60 seconds. The average delay during both
the AM and PM peak hours is only about 20 seconds.
The westbound left-turn movement volume from Samaritan Drive to National Avenue is relatively
low with 33 vehicles during the AM peak hour and 19 vehicles during the PM peak hour. Based on
field observations, it was easy for vehicles on Samaritan Drive to find gaps in traffic and turn left
onto National Avenue. There were no operational issues associated with this left-turn movement.

Lark Avenue and southbound SR 17 Ramp
There are some operational issues along Lark Avenue due to the close spacing of intersections on
Lark Avenue between Los Gatos Boulevard and Oka Road. The vehicles do not always clear each
intersection in one signal cycle. Eastbound vehicle queues regularly spill back to upstream
intersections. Allotted green times provide adequate time for queued vehicles to clear at each of the
intersections with the exception of Lark Avenue and Oka Road. The eastbound queue from the SR
17 southbound off ramp spills back and through the Oka Road intersection continuously during the
peak hours. The vehicle spill back blocks left-turns from Oka Road to eastbound Lark Avenue.
Signage is in place prohibiting the blockage of the intersection, but the primary reason for the back-
up is the signal timing at the SR 17 off-ramp. The close spacing of the intersections between Oka
Road and Los Gatos Boulevard prevents efficient timing of the intersections.

San Tomas Expressway/Camden Avenue and SR 17 Ramps
The intersections at San Tomas Expressway and the on- and off-ramps to SR 17 experience heavy
congestion during both the AM and PM peak hours, primarily in the eastbound and westbound
directions, based on field observations. The intersections of SR 17 SB Ramps/San Tomas
Expressway and SR 17 NB Ramps/Camden Avenue are closely spaced, and vehicle spillback
occurs in both intersections.


                                                                                          Page |15 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                       May 5, 2016 


At the intersection of SR 17 NB Ramps/Camden Avenue, northbound vehicles on White Oaks Road
queue past the SR 17 northbound off-ramp, creating queues that begin to encroach onto SR 17
during both AM and PM peak hour periods. During both peak hours, the southbound vehicle
queues extend back nearly 40 vehicles in length to the intersection of McGlincy Ln/Curtner Ave,
eastbound vehicle queues extend back to the intersection of SR 17 SB/San Tomas Expressway,
and the westbound through vehicle queue blocks vehicles from entering the westbound left-turn
pocket.
The SR 17 SB Ramps/San Tomas Expressway intersection has a number of operational issues that
occur during the PM peak hour, including a large SB left-turn vehicle queue that was observed to
back up onto the freeway and took two signal cycles to clear the intersection. The long eastbound
vehicle queue blocks vehicles from merging onto San Tomas Expressway from Winchester
Boulevard. During the AM peak hour, many eastbound vehicles attempt to merge into a single right-
turn lane on San Tomas Expressway situated between Winchester Boulevard and the SR 17
ramps.
The remaining study intersections were not observed to have any significant operational problems.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes existing plus project traffic conditions, including the method by which project
traffic is estimated. Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were
to be occupied prior to the other approved projects in the area. It is unlikely that this traffic condition
would occur, since other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely be
built and occupied during the time the project is going through the development review process.

Transportation Network Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions
would be the same as the existing transportation network with the following exception:
Signalization of Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive – The Samaritan Medical Campus
Development project would install a new traffic signal at this location. Improvements would include
adding a fourth leg (southbound leg) to the intersection, converting the existing two-way left-turn
lane on Samaritan Drive into dedicated eastbound and westbound left-turn pockets with protected
left-turn phasing, and adding crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads on Samaritan Drive.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the
site is estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate
is made of the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip
assignment, the project trips are assigned to specific streets. These procedures are described
further in the following sections.

Trip Generation
The magnitude of traffic added to the roadway system by a particular development is estimated by
multiplying the applicable trip generation rates by the size of the development. The standard trip
generation rates are based on counts of similar types of development and are published in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition. The trip
rates published by ITE for Medical-Dental Office Building (ITE land use code 720) were used for
this project. The AM and PM peak hour rates are based on the average published rates.
According to ITE, a medical-dental office building is defined as a facility that provides diagnoses
and outpatient care on a routine basis but is unable to provide prolonged in-house medical and
surgical care. One or more private physicians or dentists generally operate this type of facility.
The proposed Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan would include a total of 475,250
square feet (s.f.) of medical office development on both sides of Samaritan Drive. According to ITE

                                                                                           Page |17 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                                                        May 5, 2016 


trip generation rates, this amount of medical office development would generate 17,171 gross daily
trips with 1,136 gross trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 1,697 gross trips during the PM
peak hour.

Existing Uses
Trips that are generated by existing uses can be subtracted from the gross project trip generation
estimates. The existing buildings on the sites north of Samaritan Drive and on Samaritan Court are
both occupied and are generating traffic. Thus, the project will receive trip credits for these existing
uses. The site driveways were counted on February 5, 2015 during the AM and PM peak hours.

Net Project Trips
After applying the existing site trip credits, the Campus Development Plan would generate 14,167
new daily vehicle trips, with 834 new trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 1,398 new trips
occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/outbound splits published in ITE Trip
Generation Manual, the project would produce 655 new inbound and 179 new outbound trips during
the AM peak hour, and 400 new inbound and 998 new outbound trips during the PM peak hour.
The project trip generation estimates are presented in Table 5.

    Rates based on Medical-Dental Office Building (720), ITE Trip Generation, Ninth Edition, 2012, average rates.
2
    Existing AM and PM peak hour trip credits based on 2/5/2015 driveway counts and 1/28/2014 Samaritan Ct counts. The peak
    hour trips for MOBs typically represent approximately 10 percent of daily trips. Existing daily trips were calculated accordingly.



Trip Distribution Pattern and Trip Assignment
The trip distribution pattern developed for the proposed project was based largely on the existing
trip distribution pattern on the surrounding roadway network. The trip distribution pattern was
refined based on the projected areas to be served by the proposed medical office development and
information obtained from studying vehicles leaving the existing medical offices on Samaritan Drive.
The trip distribution pattern is shown graphically on Figure 5.
The peak-hour trips generated by the proposed project were assigned to the roadway system in
accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed above. The project trip assignment assumes
access to Samaritan Court via Samaritan Drive only. Figure 6 shows the project trip assignment at
the study intersections.

Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The project trips were added to existing traffic volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes
(see Figure 7). Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Existing Plus Project Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are
summarized in Table 6.

San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but three of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable
level of service (LOS D or better) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under existing plus
project conditions. The following City of San Jose study intersections would operate at an
unacceptable level of service (LOS E):

City of San Jose Intersections
    (1) Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the AM peak hour
    (10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections located in San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell would operate at an
acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under existing plus project
conditions.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed project. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise volumes
from existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in the vicinity of
the site. This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes and
the resulting traffic conditions. The background scenario predicts a realistic traffic condition that
would occur as approved development gets built and occupied.

Background Transportation Network
It was assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would
be the same as the existing network with the exception of the following intersection improvements
that will be implemented as part of the North Forty Specific Plan:
SR 17 SB Ramps and Lark Avenue – The eastbound approach will be reconfigured to provide one
left-turn lane, two through lanes, and 1 through/right-turn lane.
Los Gatos Boulevard and Lark Avenue – A third eastbound left-turn lane will be added on Lark
Avenue, and a dedicated receiving lane for southbound right turns will be added on Lark Avenue.

Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak hour volumes the
estimated traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments. The added traffic from
approved but not yet completed developments within the City of San Jose was provided by City of
San Jose staff in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI). Town of Los Gatos staff provided
project information for all approved but not yet completed developments within Los Gatos. Six of
the approved projects in the Town of Los Gatos were included as background projects in this traffic
study based on their proximity to the Samaritan site and/or their size.
The approved projects in San Jose and Los Gatos that would add traffic to the intersections that
were studied are listed below. Background traffic volumes are shown graphically on Figure 8.
The City of San Jose ATI is included in Appendix B. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are
tabulated in Appendix C.

Approved Projects in the City of San Jose
       Harker School – This approved project includes a Planned Development Permit to allow
        redevelopment of the existing 7.7-acre former Santa Clara County Children's Shelter
        campus including demolition of two existing 4,800 square-foot (s.f.) buildings, construction
        of a new 17,500 s.f. multi-purpose building, a 2,500 s.f. accessory structure and other
        improvements for a private elementary school for up to 600 pre-K through 5th grade
        students. The site is located on the west side of Union Avenue, approximately 100 feet
        southerly of Barrett Avenue.
       Stanford Medical Center –This approved and recently completed project includes the
        development of a new Stanford Cancer Center on a site directly west of the Samaritan
        campus, at the north corner of Los Gatos Blvd and Samaritan Dr. This project was
        occupied after counts for nearby intersections had been completed.

Approved Projects in the Town of Los Gatos
       Albright Way Office – This approved project will replace 250,000 s.f. of existing offices with
        485,000 s.f. of offices at the intersection of Albright Way and Winchester Boulevard.
       Lunardi’s Supermarket – This approved project will add 6,204 s.f. to the already existing
        supermarket at 720 Blossom Hill Road.
       Bentley Silicon Valley – This approved project will increase the square footage of the
        existing auto dealership at 620 Blossom Hill Road from 26,085 s.f. to 31.909 s.f.
       375 Knowles Drive Residential Development – This approved project includes the
        development of 33 detached homes at 375 Knowles Drive.
       Swanson Ford Mixed-Use Project – This approved project will demolish the existing auto
        dealer and construct a new mixed-use facility. The residential portions of this project were
        occupied in 2014.
       North Forty Specific Plan – As proposed, this project/Specific Plan ultimately would consist
        of 73 single-family homes, 73 apartment units, 218 condominium units, a 269,000 s.f.
        shopping center, a 150-room hotel, 62,500 s.f. of medical offices, and 62,500 s.f. of general
        offices. The project is located on the North Forty site contained by SR 85 to the north, Los
        Gatos Blvd to the east, Lark Ave to the south, and SR 17 to the west. The actual amount of
        potential development that has been approved, and is therefore included under background
        conditions in this traffic report, consists of 270 residential units and 435,000 s.f. of
        commercial uses. This information was provided by Town of Los Gatos staff.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Background Conditions
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are
summarized in Table 7. The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in
Appendix D.

San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but three of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable
level of service (LOS D or better) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background
conditions. The following City of San Jose study intersections would operate at an unacceptable
level of service (LOS E):
City of San Jose Intersections
    (1) Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the AM peak hour
    (10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour


                                                                                       Page |26

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections located in San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell would operate at an
acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background
conditions.

Background Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes near-term traffic conditions that most likely would occur when the project is
complete. It includes a description of the significance criteria used to establish what constitutes a
project impact, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts caused by the
project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in
order to determine potential project impacts. This traffic scenario represents a more congested
traffic condition than the existing plus project scenario, since it includes traffic generated by
approved but not yet built projects in the area.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria
used to determine significant impacts on signalized intersections are based on City of San Jose,
City of Campbell, and Town of Los Gatos Level of Service standards. Project impacts on CMP
study intersections were analyzed according to the County Congestion Management Program
(CMP) methodology. Note that the two study intersections located in the City of Campbell are CMP
intersections and were evaluated according to CMP standards.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized
intersection in the City of San Jose if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at an intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project
       conditions, or
    2. The level of service at an intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C)
       to increase by one percent (.01) or more.
An exception to rule #2 applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or
more.
A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when
measures are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions
or better.


                                                                                         Page |28

City of Campbell Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized
intersection in the City of Campbell if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at a non-CMP intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or
       better under background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus
       project conditions, or
    2. The level of service at a non-CMP intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under
       background conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement
       delay at the CMP intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-
       capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by one percent (.01) or more, or
    3. The level of service at a CMP-designated intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS E
       or better under background conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under background plus
       project conditions, or
    4. The level of service at a CMP-designated intersection is an unacceptable LOS F under
       background conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement
       delay at the CMP intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-
       capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by one percent (.01) or more.
An exception to rules #2 and #4 above applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the
amount of average delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for
critical movements is negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the
critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact at a non-CMP intersection is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore the non-CMP intersection level of service to background
conditions or better. A significant impact at a CMP-designated intersection is said to be
satisfactorily mitigated when measures are implemented that would restore the CMP intersection
level of service to LOS E or better.
Note that since the two study intersections located in the City of Campbell are CMP-designated
intersections, only the CMP significant impact criteria apply to those intersections.
Town of Los Gatos Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized
intersection in the Town of Los Gatos if for either peak hour:
    1. The addition of project traffic causes an intersection operating at LOS A, B, or C under
       background conditions to degrade more than one letter grade, or
    2. The level of service at an intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project
       conditions, or
    3. The level of service at an intersection is operating at LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes any increase in vehicle delay.
CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is described above under City of
Campbell Definition of Significant Impacts at CMP Intersections. A CMP intersection that operates
at LOS F would fail to meet the CMP level of service standard.

CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts
The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better. A project
is said to create a significant impact on traffic conditions on a freeway segment if for either peak
hour:

                                                                                        Page |29

    1. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better
       under existing conditions to an unacceptable LOS F with the addition of project trips, or
    2. The level of service on the freeway segment is already operating at an unacceptable LOS F
       and the number of project trips added to the segment constitutes at least one percent of
       capacity of the segment.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to existing conditions or better.

Background Plus Project Conditions Transportation Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background plus project
conditions would be the same as the background network with the following exception:
Signalization of Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive – The Samaritan Medical Campus
Development project would install a new traffic signal at this location. Improvements would include
adding a fourth leg (southbound leg) to the intersection, converting the existing two-way left-turn
lane on Samaritan Drive into dedicated eastbound and westbound left-turn pockets with protected
left-turn phasing, and adding crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads on Samaritan Drive.

Project Trip Estimates
As previously described in Chapter 3 (see Table 5), the proposed Samaritan Medical Campus
Development project is expected to generate 14,167 new daily vehicle trips, with 834 new trips
occurring during the AM peak hour and 1,398 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Based
on the inbound/outbound splits published in ITE Trip Generation Manual, the project would produce
655 new inbound and 179 new outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 400 new inbound and
998 new outbound trips during the PM peak hour.

Background Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The peak hour trips generated by the project were added to background traffic volumes to obtain
background plus project traffic volumes (see Figure 9). The project trips were assigned to the
roadway system in accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed in Chapter 3.
Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Background Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus project conditions
are summarized in Table 8.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but four of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable
level of service (LOS D or better) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background
plus project conditions. The following City of San Jose study intersections would operate at an
unacceptable level of service (LOS E):

City of San Jose Intersections
    (1)    Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the AM peak hour
    (4)    Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (10)   Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13)   Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against the CMP level of service standards, all of
the CMP study intersections located in San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell would operate at an
acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background plus
project conditions.

                                                                                                                      Page |32

Intersection Impacts
When measured against the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, and CMP significant impact
criteria, the following three intersections would be significantly impacted by the project:

(4) Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive
SJ Impact:     The intersection would operate at LOS D during the PM peak hour under
               background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause
               the intersection level of service to degrade to LOS E. Based on the City of San
               Jose level of service impact criteria, this constitutes a significant project impact.
Mitigation:    The level of service impact at this intersection could be mitigated by adding a third
               northbound through lane on Bascom Avenue. This improvement would require
               restriping and signal modifications to install a new detector loop and signal head for
               the new northbound lane. The proposed improvement (shown on Figure 10) would
               improve the level of service at the intersection to an acceptable LOS D and would
               satisfactorily mitigate the significant project impact.

(10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue
SJ Impact:     The intersection would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour under
               background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause
               the average critical delay at the intersection to increase by 5.0 seconds (more than
               the 4.0 second threshold) and cause the V/C ratio to increase by 0.037 (more than
               the 0.01 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of service impact criteria,
               this constitutes a significant project impact.
Mitigation:    The level of service impact at this intersection could be mitigated by adding a
               second westbound left-turn lane on Camden Avenue. However, this improvement
               would require roadway widening which is not feasible. Widening Camden Avenue
               would require right-of-way (ROW) acquisition, which would negatively impact
               multiple properties. In addition, existing pedestrian facilities and future bicycle
               facilities that are planned along Camden Avenue also would be negatively affected,
               which conflicts with the goals and policies contained in the City’s General Plan for
               this City-designated Transit Corridor. For these reasons, it can be concluded that
               there are no feasible physical improvements that can be implemented to mitigate
               the impact at the Union Avenue/Camden Avenue intersection. Therefore, this
               intersection impact must be considered significant and unavoidable.
               Since physical improvements aimed at increasing the capacity of the intersection
               are not feasible due to roadway width limitations, the intersection of Union
               Avenue/Camden Avenue is proposed to be added to the City of San Jose’s list of
               Protected Intersections. As such, in lieu of physical improvements the project
               would be required to construct offsetting improvements to other parts of the
               citywide transportation system to improve system-wide roadway capacity or to
               enhance non-auto travel modes in furtherance of the General Plan goals and
               policies. Ideally, offsetting improvements should be implemented in the
               neighborhoods surrounding the project site and/or in the neighborhoods
               surrounding the protected intersection. Note that the project also would be required
               to lengthen the westbound left-turn pocket at the intersection, which would increase
               the queuing capacity. However, neither the offsetting improvements nor the
               increased vehicle queuing capacity would mitigate the significant impact. Thus, the
               intersection impact would remain significant and unavoidable. The City’s
               Protected Intersection Policy is described in the following section.




                                                                                      Page |33 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                            May 5, 2016 


(13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road
SJ Impact:       The intersection would operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour under
                 background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause
                 the average critical delay at the intersection to increase by 10.9 seconds (more
                 than the 4.0 second threshold) and cause the V/C ratio to increase by 0.039 (more
                 than the 0.01 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of service impact
                 criteria, this constitutes a significant project impact.
Mitigation:      The level of service impact at this intersection could be mitigated by widening the
                 westbound shared through/right-turn lane on Los Gatos-Almaden Road to allow for
                 a separate right-turn movement onto northbound Union Avenue. In order to widen
                 the shared through/right-turn lane, the lanes on the westbound approach of the
                 intersection would need to be shifted approximately two feet to the south. This
                 would require relocation of the detector loops and lane restriping. The eastbound
                 left-turn lane would need to be realigned with the westbound left-turn lane, which
                 would require restriping only. The proposed improvements (shown on Figure 11)
                 would improve the level of service at the intersection to an acceptable LOS D and
                 would satisfactorily mitigate the significant project impact.
City of San Jose Protected Intersection Policy
As previously described, it is recommended that the intersection of Union Avenue and Camden
Avenue be added to the City of San Jose list of Protected Intersections. The City of San Jose
Protected Intersection Policy allows for the addition of intersections to the list so long as they are
located within designated Special Planning Areas and are consistent with the City’s General Plan.
The Special Planning Areas include:
       Transit-Oriented Development Corridors
       Planned Residential/Community Areas
       Neighborhood Business Districts
       Downtown Gateways
The Protected Intersection Policy requests that additional capacity not be added to the intersections
and they be allowed to operate at capacity with the expectation that alternative travel routes or non-
auto travel modes will be used when delays become unacceptable to drivers. Protected
Intersections consist of locations (currently 25) that have been built to their planned maximum
capacity, and where expansion of the intersection is not physically possible and/or would have an
adverse effect upon non-auto transportation facilities such as pedestrian, bicycle and transit
systems. The Protected Intersection Policy acknowledges that exceptions to the City’s LOS Policy
(Council Policy 5-3) of maintaining a Level of Service D at local intersections will be made for
certain intersections (i.e., Protected Intersections) that have been built to their maximum capacity.
Note that the LOS deficiencies at all Protected Intersections in the City of San Jose have been
disclosed and overridden in previous EIRs.
It is recognized that as delays at Protected Intersections worsen over time due to regular increases
in traffic, drivers tend to adjust their travel patterns to use alternative routes, thereby displacing
traffic to other surrounding roadways with available capacity. If trips diverted from a Protected
Intersection results in an increase in traffic in a nearby neighborhood, the City of San Jose has a
traffic calming program to address issues related to neighborhood cut-through traffic. The Protected
Intersection impact fees, as established in the City’s LOS Policy, can be used to address
neighborhood cut-through traffic issues. If a development project has a significant traffic impact at a
designated Protected Intersection, and therefore is required to pay the established fees, the project
may be approved if offsetting transportation system improvements are provided to other parts of the
Citywide transportation system to improve system-wide roadway capacity or to enhance non-auto
modes of travel in furtherance of the General Plan goals and policies.
Ideally, offsetting improvements should be implemented in the neighborhoods surrounding the
project site and/or in the neighborhoods surrounding the protected intersection. The improvements
may include enhancements to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities, as well as neighborhood

                                                                                        Page |35 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                           May 5, 2016 


traffic calming measures and other roadway improvements. The City will identify the specific
offsetting improvements, which should be agreed upon by the community. Priority is given to
improvements identified in previously adopted plans such as area-wide specific or master plans,
redevelopment plans, or plans prepared through the Strong Neighborhoods Initiative. Community
outreach should occur in conjunction with the project review and approval process. Once the
specific improvements have been identified, the developer must submit improvement plans to the
City of San Jose Department of Public Works for review and approval. The specific offsetting
improvements proposed can be finalized during the subsequent planning permit stages.
Potential improvements within the project area and adjacent neighborhoods could include:
       Prepare traffic calming studies and implement measures/devices that could include traffic
        circles, chokers, tree wells, chicanes, and permanent driver feedback radar speed signs.
       Add valuable streetscape features that include street and median trees, as well as
        neighborhood entry features such as installation of bulb-outs at the Kinghurst Drive/
        Samaritan Drive intersection.
       Improve and/or add pedestrian connections throughout the project area including crosswalk
        improvements at the Kinghurst Drive/Samaritan Drive intersection.
       Work with VTA to improve the existing bus service in the area, including improvements to
        bus stops such as the addition of sheltered stops where they currently do not exist.
       Install additional bike lanes to roadways in the study area where appropriate.

Sensitivity Analysis for Union Avenue and Camden Avenue
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the maximum amount of medical office space
that could be built without significantly impacting the Union Avenue/Camden Avenue intersection.
The results of the sensitivity analysis show that up to 275,000 net square feet of new medical office
space could be built on the project site without triggering a significant impact at this intersection.
The detailed intersection level of service calculations based on 275,000 net square feet of medical
office development are included at the end of Appendix D.

Project Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
Traffic volumes on the study freeway segments were estimated by adding project trips to the
existing volumes obtained from the 2012 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results of the
freeway segment analysis show that the project would cause significant increases in traffic volumes
(one percent or more of freeway capacity) on four of the study freeway segments currently
operating at LOS F, and would also cause the level of service on one freeway segment to degrade
from LOS E to LOS F (see Table 9).
Based on CMP freeway impact criteria, the following study freeway segments would be significantly
impacted by the project:
    Northbound SR 85, between Camden Avenue and Union Avenue – AM peak hour
    Northbound SR 85, between Union Avenue and Bascom Avenue – AM peak hour
    Southbound SR 85, between Bascom Avenue and Union Avenue – PM peak hour
    Southbound SR 85, between SR 17 and Bascom Avenue – PM peak hour
    Southbound SR 85, between Winchester Boulevard and SR 17 – PM peak hour
Mitigation of significant project impacts on freeway segments would require roadway widening to
construct additional through lanes, thereby increasing freeway capacity. Since it is not feasible for
an individual development project to bear responsibility for implementing such extensive
transportation system improvements due to constraints in acquisition and cost of right-of-way, and
no comprehensive project to add through lanes has been developed by Caltrans or VTA for
individual projects to contribute to, the significant impacts on the directional freeway segments
identified above must be considered significant and unavoidable.

Project Alternative Conditions
A reduced project alternative traffic scenario was prepared that only analyzes the effects of
replacing the 18,064 s.f. medical office building on the Samaritan Court site with 115,250 s.f. of
medical office space, resulting in a net increase of 97,186 s.f. of medical office space. This project
alternative is being analyzed at the request of the City of San Jose, since development of the
Samaritan Court site could potentially occur in advance of the additional development on the north
side of Samaritan Drive.

Background Plus Project Alternative Traffic Volumes
The AM and PM peak-hour project alternative trips (see Table 10) were assigned to the roadway
network in accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed in Chapter 3. Figure 12 shows the
project alternative trip assignment. The trips generated by the project alternative were added to
background traffic volumes to obtain background plus project alternative traffic volumes (see Figure
13).
Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Background Plus Project Alternative Intersection LOS Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus project alternative
conditions are summarized in Table 11.

San Jose and Los Gatos Intersection Analysis
The results of the analysis show that, measured against City of San Jose and Town of Los Gatos
level of service standards, all but three of the study intersections would operate at an acceptable
level of service (LOS D or better) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background
plus project alternative conditions. The following City of San Jose study intersections would operate
at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E):

City of San Jose Intersections
    (1) Bascom Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the AM peak hour
    (10) Union Avenue and Camden Avenue (CMP) – LOS E during the PM peak hour
    (13) Union Avenue and Los Gatos-Almaden Road – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection analysis show that, measured against the CMP level of service
standards, all of the CMP study intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS E or better
during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic under background plus project alternative conditions.

Intersection Impacts – Project Alternative
When measured against the City of San Jose, Town of Los Gatos, and CMP significant impact
criteria, none of the study intersections would be significantly impacted by the project alternative.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Project Alternative Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
Traffic volumes on the study freeway segments were estimated by adding project alternative trips to
the existing volumes obtained from the 2012 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results of the
freeway segment analysis show that the project alternative would cause the level of service on one
freeway segment to degrade from LOS E to LOS F (see Table 12). Based on CMP freeway impact
criteria, the following study freeway segment would be significantly impacted by the project
alternative:
    Southbound SR 85, between Winchester Boulevard and SR 17 – PM peak hour
Mitigation of significant project impacts on freeway segments would require roadway widening to
construct additional through lanes, thereby increasing freeway capacity. Since it is not feasible for
an individual development project to bear responsibility for implementing such extensive
transportation system improvements due to constraints in acquisition and cost of right-of-way, and
no comprehensive project to add through lanes has been developed by Caltrans or VTA for
individual projects to contribute to, the significant impacts on the directional freeway segments
identified above must be considered significant and unavoidable.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues related to the project, including:

       Vehicular site access and circulation
       National Avenue & Samaritan Drive intersection operations
       Additional access via National Avenue
       Signal warrants
       Vehicle queuing and storage at selected intersections
       Potential project impacts to bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities
       Parking
       Neighborhood Traffic Levels
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses
in this chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods
employed by the traffic engineering community.

Site Access & Circulation
Since a detailed site plan is not yet available, a comprehensive analysis of site access and
circulation cannot be prepared. However, a general evaluation of site access and on-site circulation
was completed for the roadways that would provide access to the site, as well as the proposed
internal roadway network, based on the conceptual site plan that was provided. The details of the
evaluation are described below.

Site Access
A review of the Samaritan Medical Campus Development project site plan was performed to
determine whether adequate site access and circulation would be provided. This review was based
on the conceptual site plan prepared by RBB Architects, Inc. dated January 21, 2015 (Figure 14).
Access to the project site would be provided via Samaritan Drive, which extends westward from
Union Avenue to Bascom Avenue/Los Gatos Boulevard. As previously described, the project would
install a new traffic signal at the intersection of Samaritan Court & Samaritan Drive. Improvements
would include adding a fourth leg (southbound leg) to the intersection, converting the existing two-
way center left-turn lane on Samaritan Drive into dedicated eastbound and westbound left-turn
pockets with protected left-turn phasing, and adding crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads on
Samaritan Drive. The new signalized intersection would serve as the only access to the proposed
development on the Samaritan Court site, and would serve as the primary access to the proposed
development on the north side of Samaritan Drive. The north site would continue to be served by
two existing driveways north of Samaritan Court and one driveway south of Samaritan Court.

                                                                                       Page |45 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                            May 5, 2016 


Site Circulation – Samaritan Court
A cul-de-sac at the end of Samaritan Court would provide access to a 428-space 2.5-level parking
structure and an 8-space surface parking lot. Based on the conceptual site plan, it is assumed that
the small 8-space surface lot would provide handicapped parking only. The site plan shows
passenger loading zones at the entrances to both proposed new medical office buildings. The site
plan does not show detail related to truck loading zones or trash staging areas. It is assumed that
small delivery vehicles would utilize the passenger loading zones.
Parking Structure
The design of the parking structure should consider the driveway and ramp width serving the
structure, the ramp slope, the ramp vertical clearance, the inside turning radius at all locations of
change in aisle direction, and the width of the drive aisles. The site plan shows pedestrian
connections between the parking structure and the two medical office buildings.
Site Circulation – North Site
A roundabout on the project site would join the new leg of the Samaritan Court/Samaritan Drive
intersection with two new drive aisles on site. The drive aisles would provide access to a new
1,106-space parking structure and multiple surface parking lots, and would connect two of the
existing entrances. All of the on-site intersections (4 in total) would be controlled using roundabouts.
The site plan shows passenger loading zones at the entrances to the three proposed new medical
office buildings. The site plan does not show detail related to truck loading zones or trash staging
areas. It is assumed that small delivery vehicles would utilize the passenger loading zones. The site
plan does not show any pedestrian connections along the proposed new internal roadway network.
Parking Structure
The design of the parking structure should consider the driveway and ramp width serving the
structure, the ramp slope, the ramp vertical clearance, the inside turning radius at all locations of
change in aisle direction, and the width of the drive aisles.
Overall, the conceptual site plan exhibits good site access and on-site circulation for motor vehicles.

National Avenue & Samaritan Drive Intersection Operations
As described in Chapter 2, left turns from National Avenue onto Samaritan Drive currently are
difficult due to the close proximity of this intersection to Bascom Avenue. Despite the difficulty, there
are 121 vehicles making the left turn during the AM peak hour and 131 vehicles during the PM peak
hour. Observations also showed some vehicles, although not a large number, making right turns
and then u-turns from National Avenue to westbound Samaritan Drive. The City of San Jose
requested a discussion of what would happen if left turns were prohibited at this intersection. There
are two existing local streets in the vicinity of the project site that intersect National Avenue–Lost
Oaks Drive (about 1,100 feet south of Samaritan Drive) and Carlton Avenue (about 2,000 feet south
of Samaritan Drive)–that drivers probably would utilize to avoid the National/Samaritan intersection.
Lost Oaks Drive and Carlton Avenue both intersect Kinghurst Drive, so northbound traffic along
National already has the option to use these streets to access Samaritan Drive. The existing 33
westbound left turns during the AM peak hour and 19 westbound left turns during the PM peak hour
also probably would use Kinghurst and use either Lost Oaks or Carlton to access National.
If left turns from northbound National Avenue onto westbound Samaritan Drive were prohibited,
some drivers would opt to instead turn right and make a u-turn to head west on Samaritan, since
this is what some drivers do today. The conceptual striping plan shown on Figure 15 would facilitate
u-turns so that drivers would not have to enter the Samaritan medical office site to turn around,
which some drivers do today. The figure shows a redesign of one of the Samaritan driveways to
accommodate the u-turn movement. The figure also shows the installation of a raised median
island on Samaritan Drive, which would be necessary to guarantee that left turns from National
Avenue would not occur. The proposed project mitigation at the Bascom Avenue/Samaritan Drive
intersection is also shown on the figure, since it is assumed that all of the improvements along
Samaritan Drive would be implemented at once.

                                                                                        Page |47 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                           May 5, 2016 


Note that there are three parking lots that currently serve medical office buildings and connect
National Avenue to Samaritan Drive. Thus, if left-turn access at National/Samaritan were
eliminated, all of these buildings could utilize their existing driveways to access Samaritan Drive
and, therefore, would not be affected.

Gap Analysis on Samaritan Drive at National Avenue
Counts were conducted of the gaps in traffic on eastbound and westbound Samaritan Drive at
National Avenue. Based on AM and PM peak hour field observations of vehicle speeds and driver
behavior, the minimum two-way gap time required for a vehicle to turn left from National Avenue
onto westbound Samaritan Drive is approximately 7 seconds. The majority of gaps that were
counted during the AM and PM peak hours were between 7 and 10 seconds long, although gaps in
excess of 25 seconds also were observed. It is important to note that the project would not add trips
to the northbound left-turn movement at this intersection.
During the AM peak one-hour period, 60 two-way gaps of 7 seconds or more were counted. The
average recorded two-way gap time was approximately 11 seconds, which often provides adequate
time for two vehicles to turn left from National Avenue. Based on the number and length of gaps
observed, it is estimated that approximately 120 vehicles can turn left from National Avenue onto
Samaritan Drive during the AM peak hour of traffic. This happens to be the existing AM peak hour
northbound left-turn volume (based on the January 2014 traffic count).
During the PM peak one-hour period, 84 two-way gaps of 7 seconds or more were counted. The
average recorded two-way gap time was approximately 11.5 seconds, which often provides
adequate time for two vehicles to turn left from National Avenue. Based on the number and length
of gaps observed, it is estimated that approximately 168 vehicles can turn left from National Avenue
onto Samaritan Drive during the PM peak hour of traffic. Since the existing northbound left-turn PM
count is 130 vehicles, a sufficient number of gaps in traffic on Samaritan Drive currently exist.
The Samaritan Medical Campus Development project would increase the amount of traffic on
Samaritan Drive by approximately 35 percent compared to Background Conditions. This would
reduce the number and length of gaps in the flow of eastbound and westbound traffic on Samaritan
Drive. Due to the expected reduction in adequate two-way gaps, eliminating the left turn movement
from northbound National Avenue onto westbound Samaritan Drive by installing a channelized
median island with u-turns (see Figure 15) would improve the traffic flow.

Additional Access via National Avenue
An additional access scenario was prepared to evaluate the effects of providing additional access
to Samaritan Court via National Avenue. The additional access scenario would allow for full access
to the project (both the north site and the Samaritan Court site) and would connect National Avenue
to Samaritan Drive. For the additional access scenario, some project-generated traffic was
reassigned to account for additional site access via National Avenue. It is important to emphasize
that the currently proposed project does not include access via National Avenue. This alternative
access scenario was evaluated for informational purposes only.

Additional Access Scenario Traffic Volumes
The AM and PM peak-hour project trips with additional access via National Avenue were assigned
to the roadway network in accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed in Chapter 3. With
additional site access provided via National Avenue to Samaritan Court, some project traffic
generated south of the site would be diverted from Union Avenue and Los Gatos Boulevard to Los
Gatos-Almaden Road and National Avenue. It is estimated that 60 project trips (47 inbound and 13
outbound) would use National Avenue to access the north and south sites directly during the AM
peak hour, and 101 project trips (29 inbound and 72 outbound trips) would utilize National Avenue
to access the sites directly during the PM peak hour.
If left-turn access at the National Avenue/Samaritan Drive intersection were to be eliminated, some
of the left turns that currently utilize this intersection would instead use the Samaritan Court/

                                                                                       Page |49 
Samaritan Medical Campus Development Plan                                              May 5, 2016 


Samaritan Drive intersection to access National Avenue. Currently, just 33 vehicles turn left from
Samaritan Drive onto National Avenue during the AM peak hour and only 19 vehicles turn left
during the PM peak hour. Most or all of these vehicles would use Samaritan Court to access
National Avenue if the left-turn access at National Avenue/Samaritan Drive were eliminated.
Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that half of the vehicles currently turning left from National
Avenue onto Samaritan Drive would utilize the Samaritan Court connection, while the other half
would choose to turn right onto Samaritan Drive from National Avenue and make a u-turn at the first
possible opportunity to ultimately head west on Samaritan. This u-turn movement is occurring today
and would continue to occur in the future. Based on this assumption, approximately 60 AM peak
hour vehicles and 65 PM peak hour vehicles currently traveling northbound on National Avenue to
access westbound Samaritan Drive would be diverted to the Samaritan Court connection.

Additional Access Scenario Intersection Analysis
Providing additional access to the project site via Samaritan Court would not change the traffic
volumes at the signalized study intersections. Therefore, the intersection level of service analysis
results would remain unchanged between the project scenario and the additional access scenario.
Note that a direct connection between National Drive and Samaritan Drive via Samaritan Court
would most likely reduce the traffic volumes on Kinghurst Drive and at the Kinghurst Drive/
Samaritan Drive intersection.

Signal Warrants
Signal warrant checks (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4, Warrant 3) were performed for the four (4)
unsignalized study intersections. All four unsignalized intersections are located near the project site
along Samaritan Drive. With the addition of project-generated traffic, three of the four unsignalized
study intersections would meet the signal warrant.

National Avenue and Samaritan Drive
The analysis revealed that the signal warrant currently is not satisfied, but would be satisfied under
Background, Existing Plus Project, and Background Plus Project conditions.
The vehicle delays at this intersection are discussed as an issue earlier in this chapter, and are
primarily caused by the close proximity between this intersection and the Bascom Avenue/
Samaritan Drive intersection. Due to the limited spacing between these two intersections, installing
a traffic signal at National Avenue is not a feasible option.

Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive
The analysis revealed that the signal warrant currently is not satisfied, but would be satisfied under
Existing Plus Project and Background Plus Project conditions. The signal warrant would also be
satisfied with the development of Samaritan Court only (Project Alternative Conditions).
As previously described in the traffic report, the project includes a new traffic signal at this location.

Kinghurst Drive and Samaritan Drive
The analysis revealed that the signal warrant currently is not satisfied, but would be satisfied under
Existing Plus Project and Background Plus Project conditions. However, since the project plans to
signalize the intersection of Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive, providing a traffic signal at
Kinghurst Drive and Samaritan Drive would not be practical due to the limited spacing (only about
250 feet) between these two intersections.

Samaritan Place and Samaritan Drive
The analysis revealed that the signal warrant would not be satisfied at this intersection under any
traffic scenario.
The signal warrant worksheets are included in Appendix E.

Intersection Queuing Analysis
The analysis of intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of traffic operations
for intersections where the project would add left turns. The operations analysis is based on vehicle
queuing for high demand left-turn movements at intersections. Vehicle queues were estimated
using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle
movement using the following formula:
                         P (x=n) =        n e – (
                                             n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Avg. # of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate
the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement;
(2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length,
assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the
existing or planned storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for
estimating future left-turn storage requirements at signalized intersections. The 95th percentile
queue length value indicates that during the peak hour, a queue of this length or less would occur
on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue length larger than the 95th percentile queue would
only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a
60-second cycle length). Thus, left-turn storage pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue
length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th
percentile queue length is also known as the “design queue length.” The vehicle queue estimates
and a tabulated summary of the findings are provided in Tables 13 and 14.

Bascom Avenue and SR85 Northbound Ramps
Northbound Left Turns: The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the
northbound dual left-turn pocket at the Bascom Avenue/SR85 Northbound Ramps intersection
currently exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity during both the AM and PM peak hours, and
that this condition would continue to occur under existing plus project, background and background
plus project conditions. The northbound left-turn pocket provides approximately 200 feet of vehicle
storage per lane for a total capacity of up to 16 vehicles. Under background conditions, the 95th
percentile vehicle queue would be 300 feet per lane during both the AM and PM peak hours. The
project would increase the maximum vehicle queue by one vehicle length (25 feet) per lane during
the AM peak hour and by three vehicle lengths (75 feet) per lane during the PM peak hour.
Extending the northbound left-turn pocket is not possible due to the presence of back-to-back left-
turn pockets. However, since Bascom Avenue has three lanes in the northbound direction and a
relatively low through traffic volume, occasionally blocking the inside through lane would not create
any significant operational issues. Therefore, no improvements are recommended.

Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive
Southbound Left Turns: The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the
southbound dual left-turn pocket at the Bascom Avenue/Samaritan Drive intersection currently
exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity during both AM and PM peak hours, and that this
condition would continue to occur under existing plus project, background and background plus
project conditions. The southbound left-turn pocket provides about 200 feet of vehicle storage per
lane for a capacity of up to approximately 16 vehicles. Under background conditions, the 95th
percentile vehicle queue would be 375 feet per lane during the AM peak hour and 325 feet per lane
during the PM peak hour. The project would increase the maximum vehicle queue by five vehicle
lengths (125 feet) per lane during the AM peak hour and three vehicle lengths (75 feet) per lane
during the PM peak hour.

Notes:
1
    Vehicle queue calculations based on cycle length for signalized intersections and movement delay for unsignalized intersections.
2
    Assumes 25 feet per vehicle queued.
3
    Although there is only 150 feet of vehicle queuing space on Samaritan Drive between Bascom Avenue and the WB left-turn lane at National Avenue,
    the shared left/through lane configuration on Samaritan Drive provides for an unlimited amount of vehicle storage.


Recommendation: There is not adequate space to lengthen the southbound left-turn pocket at this
intersection due to the upstream SR 85 southbound ramps intersection. Improving signal
synchronization along Bascom Avenue would help to improve the flow of traffic in both the
northbound and southbound directions, resulting in fewer vehicle queuing issues.
Westbound Left Turns: The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the
westbound left-turn movement at the Bascom Avenue/Samaritan Drive intersection currently extend
past National Avenue and that the project would lengthen the queue by one vehicle (25 feet) per
lane during the AM peak hour and four vehicles (100 feet) per lane during the PM peak hour.
Although the westbound vehicle queue blocks access from National Avenue, there is virtually
unlimited space for vehicle queuing on Samaritan Drive. Also, due to the split phase operation of
the Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive signal and the shared left-turn/through lane configuration,
the westbound vehicle queues do not block the flow of traffic on Samaritan Drive.
Recommendation: One possible solution would be to close left-turn access from northbound
National Avenue to westbound Samaritan Drive by installing a channelized median island for
improved traffic flow, as previously shown on Figure 15.

    Although there is only 150 feet of vehicle queuing space on Samaritan Drive between Bascom Avenue and the WB left-turn lane at National Avenue,
    the shared left/through lane configuration on Samaritan Drive provides for an unlimited amount of vehicle storage.



Union Avenue and SR 85 (South)
During the AM peak hour, the maximum vehicle queue for the northbound left-turn lane at the Union
Avenue/SR85 (South) intersection currently exceeds the existing vehicle storage capacity and
would continue to do so under existing plus project, background and background plus project
conditions. The northbound left-turn lane provides approximately 125 feet of vehicle storage for a
capacity of up to 5 vehicles. Under background conditions, the 95th percentile vehicle queue would
be 250 feet. The project would increase the maximum vehicle queue by two vehicles (50 feet)
during the AM peak hour.
The northbound left-turn lane is limited to 125 feet due to the presence of back-to-back left-turn
lanes. Therefore, there are no feasible improvements to address the queuing issue.

Union Avenue and Camden Avenue
Westbound Left Turns: The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the
westbound left-turn lane at the Union Avenue/Camden Avenue intersection currently exceed the
existing vehicle storage capacity during both the AM and PM peak hours, and that this condition
would continue to occur under existing plus project, background and background plus project
conditions. The westbound left-turn pocket provides approximately 200 feet of vehicle storage, or
enough space for approximately 8 queued vehicles. Under background conditions, the 95th
percentile vehicle queue length would be 475 feet during the AM peak hour and 350 feet during the
PM peak hour. The project would increase the maximum vehicle queue by two vehicle lengths (50
feet) during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Recommendation: Lengthen the westbound left-turn pocket by 200 feet to provide the maximum
amount of vehicle storage possible: 400 feet of total storage. This improvement would require
removal of 10 small trees and one relatively large tree within the median island, median
reconstruction, and basic striping modifications.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
All new development projects in San Jose should encourage multi-modal travel, consistent with the
goals of the City’s General Plan. It is the goal of the General Plan that all development projects
accommodate and encourage the use of non-automobile transportation modes to achieve San
Jose’s mobility goals and reduce vehicle trip generation and vehicle miles traveled. In addition, the
adopted City Bike Master Plan establishes goals, policies and actions to make bicycling a daily part
of life in San Jose. The Master Plan includes designated bike lanes along all City streets, as well as
on designated bike corridors. In order to further the goals of the City, pedestrian and bicycle
facilities should be encouraged with new development projects.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities in the project area consist primarily of sidewalks. Sidewalks are found along
virtually all previously described local roadways in the study area and along the local residential
streets and collectors near the site. At Samaritan Place, there is a pedestrian footbridge over SR-85
connecting Samaritan Place to White Oaks Avenue. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and
push buttons are located at all of the signalized intersections in the study area.
Samaritan Drive mainly serves local residents and the existing medical offices. All of the pedestrian
crossings on Samaritan Drive have clearly marked pavement and appropriate signage. The
crosswalk located at the intersection of Kinghurst Drive/Samaritan Drive has activated flashing
overhead beacons and ADA compliant ramps. Side beacons would improve visibility and safety at
this crosswalk. The crosswalk located at the intersection of Samaritan Place/Samaritan Drive has
activated flashing side beacons and ADA compliant ramps. The crosswalk on Samaritan Drive at
the entrance to Samaritan Hospital, however, is outdated and does not have signal heads, push
buttons or ADA compliant ramps (although outdated ramps are present).
Improvements at Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive
As part of the Samaritan Medical Campus Development project, a signal would be installed at the
intersection of Samaritan Court and Samaritan Drive. The new signal would include crosswalks with
pedestrian signal heads and ADA compliant ramps.
Improvements at Kinghurst Drive and Samaritan Drive
In an effort to improve pedestrian safety at the Kinghurst Drive/Samaritan Drive intersection and
enhance the pedestrian connection between the medical offices and the residential neighborhood
to the south, City of San Jose staff intends to condition the Samaritan project to modify the
southwest and southeast corners of this intersection to include bulb-outs. In addition, the City plans
to condition the project to straighten the existing crosswalk on Samaritan Drive so that it is
perpendicular to Samaritan Drive. This would entail relocating the ADA accessible curb ramp on the
north side of Samaritan Drive. Together, these improvements would help to slow down vehicles

                                                                                      Page |54

entering and exiting Kinghurst Drive, make pedestrians more visible to drivers, and reduce the
pedestrian crossing distances, thereby creating a safer pedestrian environment at this intersection.
The conceptual improvement plan for the Kinghurst Drive/Samaritan Drive intersection is shown on
Figure 16.

Bicycle Facilities
There are no county designated bike lanes in the vicinity of the project site. However, according to
the San Jose Bike Plan 2020 Bikeway Network map, Class II striped bike lanes are planned on
Samaritan Drive from Bascom Avenue to Union Avenue. In addition, a Class III bike route is
planned for Samaritan Place, which would provide a bicycle connection between Samaritan Drive
and the existing SR 85 pedestrian overcrossing. The SR 85 overcrossing provides a pedestrian/
bike connection between Samaritan Place and White Oaks Avenue on the north side of SR 85. Bike
lanes are also planned along Bascom Avenue between Samaritan Drive and White Oaks Avenue,
and Camden Avenue between SR 17 and Leigh Avenue. This type of development (i.e., medical
office uses) would result in only a minimal increase in bicycle travel. Thus, the project would not
warrant any additional bicycle facilities beyond what is already planned for the area.

Transit Services
Although no transit reduction was applied to the estimated trip generation for the project, it can be
assumed that some of the project trips could be made by transit. Applying a 3% transit mode share
yields an estimate of approximately 25 transit trips during the AM peak hour and 42 transit trips
during the PM peak hour. Currently, there are four bus lines serving the project site: 27, 49, 61, and
62. As described in the existing conditions chapter, all these four bus routes have 30-minute
headways during commute hours. The bus stops for lines 27, 49, 61, and 62 are all located within
walking distance of the project site. The closest bus stop on Samaritan Drive is located
approximately 500 feet north of Samaritan Court. Given that the site is served by several bus
routes, these riders could be accommodated by the existing local bus service.

Parking
The conceptual site plan for the campus development project shows that approximately 450 surface
parking spaces and the existing parking garage located next to the Stanford Cancer Center would
be retained. The project would add a 428-space parking garage and 8 surface spaces on the
Samaritan Court site. On the north site, the project would add a 1,106-space parking garage.
The City parking code requires 1 parking stall per 250 s.f. of net floor area for medical office
buildings. The net floor area is calculated as 85% of the gross building area; therefore, the net floor
area is 403,962 s.f., requiring a total of 1,616 parking spaces. The combination of the new parking
garages and the parking spaces to remain would exceed the City requirements and, therefore,
would be adequate to serve the project.

Accident Analysis
Accident data were supplied by San Jose and Los Gatos for the area around the Bascom Avenue &
Samaritan Drive intersection where there are existing turning movement and queuing issues.
Despite the difficult movements that vehicles must make to get on and off National Avenue, there
have been very few accidents. In the most recent five years, there have been only two reported
accidents at the Samaritan Drive & National Avenue intersection. At the Bascom/Los Gatos
Boulevard & Samaritan Drive intersection, there have been nine reported accidents, of which five
were rear-ends, which come from drivers failing to pay attention at red lights. In summary, there is
not an obvious accident problem at the intersections of Bascom/Los Gatos Boulevard & Samaritan
Drive or National Avenue & Samaritan Drive.
