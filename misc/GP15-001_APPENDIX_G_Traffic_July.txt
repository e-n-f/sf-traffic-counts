Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared for the proposed
residential development in the Japantown area of San Jose, California. The 8.67-acre project site is
located on the northwest corner of Tenth Street and Taylor Street. The project would replace existing
commercial and warehouse buildings with a 4-story 403-unit apartment building and approximately 5,000
square feet (s.f.) of retail space. The adjacent 60,000 s.f. historical Continental Can Company warehouse
building will remain on the site and will continue to operate. Access to the Gordon Biersch property also
will remain on the site. A multi-level parking garage will provide on-site parking for the project, with site
access provided via the North Ninth Street/Taylor Street intersection and a right-turn only driveway on
North Tenth Street.
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying potential traffic impacts related to the proposed
development. The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set
forth by the City of San Jose. Since the project site is located outside the downtown core area, as defined
by the City’s General Plan, the project is subject to the City’s Transportation Level of Service Policy for
areas outside the downtown core. An analysis according to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines also was prepared, since the project
would generate more than 100 new peak hour vehicle trips. The study determined the traffic impacts of
the project on twenty-two (22) signalized intersections, one (1) unsignalized intersection, and fifteen (15)
freeway segments in the vicinity of the project site during the weekday AM and PM peak periods of traffic.
Project impacts on other transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit services, were
determined on the basis of engineering judgment. The project also will be required to comply with the US-
101/Oakland/Mabury Transportation Development Policy (TDP).

Project Trip Generation
After applying the standard ITE trip generation rates, existing trip credits, and appropriate trip reductions,
the proposed project would generate 1,926 new daily vehicle trips, with 148 new trips occurring during the
AM peak hour and 155 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/outbound splits
recommended by ITE, the project would produce 2 additional inbound trips and 146 additional outbound
trips during the AM peak hour, and 124 additional inbound trips and 31 additional outbound trips during
the PM peak hour compared to the existing uses on the site to be removed.

Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis Results
When measured against the City of San Jose significant impact criteria, the following two Protected
Intersections would be significantly impacted by the project (see Table ES-1):
                North First Street and Taylor Street
                North Thirteenth Street and Hedding Street




                                                                                            iii | Page 
 Cannery Park Village                                                                        July 9, 2015 


North First Street and Taylor Street
The level of service at this intersection would be an unacceptable LOS F during the PM peak hour under
background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the volume-to-capacity
(V/C) ratio to increase by 0.019 (more than the 0.005 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of
service impact criteria for protected intersections, this constitutes a significant project impact.

North Thirteenth Street and Hedding Street
The level of service at this intersection would be an unacceptable LOS E during the AM peak hour under
background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the volume-to-capacity
(V/C) ratio to increase by 0.007 (more than the 0.005 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of
service impact criteria for protected intersections, this constitutes a significant project impact.

Protected Intersection Requirements (Mitigation)
The study intersections of North First Street/Taylor Street and North Thirteenth Street/Hedding Street
have been identified as City of San Jose Protected Intersections. The LOS Policy has established a fee
equal to $2,821 per net peak hour project trip for one Protected Intersection impact and $4,232 per net
peak hour project trip for two or more Protected Intersection impacts to fund alternative transportation
improvements. For the purpose of determining the Protected Intersection LOS impact fee, net peak hour
project trips are defined as the total number of peak hour trips generated by the project during the highest
peak hour period after all appropriate trip credits have been applied. The value of the improvements
should be equal to the established fees. Since the project significantly impacts two Protected
Intersections, the current estimated project cost is $4,232 times 139 net PM peak hour trips.
                 Estimated Protected Intersection Impact Fee: $588,248

US 101/Oakland/Mabury Transportation Development Policy (TDP)
Since the proposed project would send some PM peak hour vehicle trips through the US 101/Oakland
Road interchange, the project would be required to pay a fair share contribution toward the planned
interchange improvements. The current TDP traffic impact fee is $34,913 per each new PM peak hour
vehicle trip that would be added to the US 101/Oakland Road interchange. The project would add 26 new
trips to the interchange during the PM peak hour of traffic.
Estimated US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP Impact Fee: $34,913 x 24 net PM peak hour trips = $837,912

Project Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis Results
The results of the freeway segment analysis show that the project would not cause significant increases
in traffic volumes (one percent or more of freeway capacity) on any of the study freeway segments
currently operating at LOS F, and none of the study freeway segments currently operating at LOS E or
better would worsen to LOS F as a result of the project (see Table ES-2). Therefore, based on CMP
freeway impact criteria, none of the study freeway segments would be significantly impacted by the
project.

Comparison Between the 2010 and 2014 Traffic Study Results
The original 2010 Cannery Park project was approved but was never built. Since that time, the project
has changed. For this reason, the results of the 2010 traffic study prepared for the original Cannery Park
project were compared against the results of the current 2014 traffic study to determine whether changes
to the project would result in different conclusions with regard to significant traffic impacts.
The results of the current traffic study are relatively consistent with the results of the 2010 traffic study.
Both studies show a significant project impact requiring payment of the Protected Intersection Traffic
Impact Fee, both studies require participation in the US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP Traffic Impact Fee
Program, and both studies show no significant freeway impacts. Where the two traffic studies differ is that
the 2010 study showed significant project impacts at four Protected Intersections, while the current 2014


                                                                                             iv | Page 
 Cannery Park Village                                                                        July 9, 2015 


study shows significant project impacts at two Protected Intersections: North First Street/Taylor Street and
North Thirteenth Street/Hedding Street. The 2010 traffic study also showed significant traffic impacts at
the Protected Intersections of North Tenth Street/Hedding Street and North Eleventh Street/Taylor Street.
The main reason for the discrepancy is that the background roadway network assumptions differ between
the two studies. The 2010 study assumed that North Tenth and North Eleventh Streets were to be
converted from one-way streets to two-way streets between Julian Street and Hedding Street. However,
the City reduced the number of travel lanes on both one-way streets from three lanes to two lanes and
added buffered bike lanes in lieu of the couplet conversion project. The couplet conversion is no longer
being considered by the City of San Jose.

Cumulative Intersection Level of Service Analysis Results
The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose and CMP level of service impact criteria,
the estimated cumulative project trips collectively would create a significant adverse traffic impact at the
following study intersections (see Table ES-1):
                 North First Street and Taylor Street (Protected Intersection)
                 Old Oakland Road and US 101 Northbound Ramps (CMP Intersection)
                 Old Oakland Road and US 101 Southbound Ramps (CMP Intersection)
                 North Thirteenth Street and Hedding Street (Protected Intersection)

Cannery Park Village Project Contribution to Cumulative Impacts
The project would contribute a considerable amount of traffic (more than 25 percent) to the North First
Street/Taylor Street intersection. The mitigation described under background plus project conditions also
would serve as mitigation under cumulative conditions. The mitigation involves payment of the City’s
Protected Intersection fee.
The proportion of project-generated traffic would equate to less than 5 percent of the increase in total
volume from background traffic conditions to cumulative traffic conditions for the two Old Oakland
Road/US 101 intersections that make up the interchange. Therefore, the project’s contribution to the
cumulative traffic impacts at the Old Oakland Road/US 101 intersections would be less than
considerable. Nevertheless, the project would be required to pay the US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP traffic
impact fee, which will fund the planned interchange improvements.
The proportion of project-generated traffic would equate to less than 15 percent of the increase in total
volume from background traffic conditions to cumulative traffic conditions for the North Thirteenth Street/
Hedding Street intersection. Therefore, the project’s contribution to the cumulative traffic impact at this
intersection would be less than considerable.

Other Transportation Issues
Signal Warrant
A peak hour signal warrant check (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4, Warrant 3) was performed for the
unsignalized study intersection of North Ninth Street and Taylor Street to determine whether signalization
would be justified on the basis of project peak hour traffic volumes. The analysis revealed that the peak
hour volume warrant would not be satisfied at the unsignalized intersection during either the AM peak
hour or PM peak hour based on background plus project traffic volumes.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared for the proposed
residential development in the Japantown area of San Jose, California. The 8.67-acre project site is
located on the northwest corner of Tenth Street and Taylor Street. The project would replace existing
commercial and warehouse buildings with a 4-story 403-unit apartment building and approximately 5,000
square feet (s.f.) of retail space. The adjacent 60,000 s.f. historical Continental Can Company warehouse
building will remain on the site and will continue to operate. Access to the Gordon Biersch property also
will remain on the site. A multi-level parking garage will provide on-site parking for the project, with site
access provided via the North Ninth Street/Taylor Street intersection and a right-turn only driveway on
North Tenth Street. Figure 1 shows the study area and project site location.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying potential traffic impacts related to the proposed
development. The impacts of the project were evaluated following the standards and methodologies set
forth by the City of San Jose. Since the project site is located outside the downtown core area, as defined
by the City’s General Plan, the project is subject to the City’s Transportation Level of Service Policy for
areas outside the downtown core. An analysis according to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines also was prepared, since the project
would generate more than 100 new peak hour vehicle trips. The study determined the traffic impacts of
the project on twenty-two (22) signalized intersections, one (1) unsignalized intersection, and fifteen (15)
freeway segments in the vicinity of the project site during the weekday AM and PM peak periods of traffic.
Project impacts on other transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit services, were
determined on the basis of engineering judgment. The intersections and freeway segments identified
below were selected to study in order to be consistent with the previous 2010 TIA prepared for the site.

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of
traffic. The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak hour of
traffic is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods on an average weekday that the
most congested traffic conditions occur.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
   Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from the City of San Jose,
                  the 2012 CMP count database, and new 2014 manual turning-movement counts. The
                  new counts have been reviewed and approved by the City of San Jose Department of
                  Transportation (DOT) for use in this traffic study. The new count data are included in
                  Appendix A.
   Scenario 2:    Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes were
                  estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                  project. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                  order to determine the effects the project would have on existing traffic conditions.
   Scenario 3:    Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                  existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
                  developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet completed developments
                  was provided by the City of San Jose in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI).
   Scenario 4:    Background Plus Project Conditions. Projected near-term peak hour traffic volumes with
                  the project were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the additional traffic
                  generated by the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
                  background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts according to the
                  City of San Jose Level of Service Policy.

   Scenario 5:    Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative traffic conditions were calculated by adding the
                  traffic generated by pending developments to background plus project conditions. The
                  list of pending developments was provided by the City of San Jose. This traffic scenario
                  was evaluated in order to fulfill the CEQA and CMP requirements.

Protected Intersection Policy
Six of the intersections that are analyzed in this study are identified as Protected Intersections in the
City’s Transportation Level of Service (LOS) Policy, Council Policy 5-3. Protected Intersections consist of
locations (there are a total of 25) that have been built to their planned maximum capacity and where
expansion of the intersection would have an adverse effect on other transportation facilities (such as
pedestrian, bicycle, transit systems, etc.). Protected Intersections are, therefore, not required to maintain
a Level of Service D, which is the City of San Jose standard. The deficiencies at all 25 Protected
Intersections in the City of San Jose have been disclosed and overridden in previous EIRs.
If a development project has significant traffic impacts at a designated Protected Intersection, the project
may be approved if offsetting Transportation System Improvements are provided. The offsetting
improvements are intended to provide other transportation benefits for the community adjacent to the
traffic impact. The improvements may include enhancements to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities,
as well as neighborhood traffic calming measures and other roadway improvements.
The City will identify the specific offsetting improvements, which should be agreed upon by the
community. Priority is given to improvements identified in previously adopted plans such as area-wide
specific or master plans, redevelopment plans, or plans prepared through the Strong Neighborhoods
Initiative. Community outreach should occur in conjunction with the project review and approval process.
Once the specific improvements have been identified, the developer must submit improvement plans to
the City of San Jose Department of Public Works for review and approval. The specific offsetting
improvements proposed can be finalized during the subsequent planning permit stages and can be
described in the Final EIR.
The LOS Policy has established a fee equal to $2,821 per net peak hour project trip for one intersection
impact and $4,232 per net peak hour project trip for multiple intersection impacts to fund alternative
transportation improvements. For the purpose of determining the Protected Intersection LOS impact fee,
net peak hour project trips are defined as the total number of peak hour trips generated by the project
during the highest peak hour period after all appropriate trip credits have been applied. The value of the
improvements should be equal to the established fees.

US 101/Oakland/Mabury Transportation Development Policy (TDP)
The City of San Jose has identified operational problems along the Oakland Road corridor at the US 101
interchange, which are due primarily to the capacity constraints of the interchange. The interchange’s
current configuration is inadequate to serve the vehicular demand due to it serving as the main gateway
into the Oakland Road area and as the only route across US 101. As a result, the City has identified two
key capital improvement projects: 1) modification of the US 101/Oakland Road interchange, including
improvements to the Oakland Road/Commercial Street intersection, and 2) construction of a new US
101/Mabury Road interchange. Both interchange projects will create additional capacity for accessing and
crossing US 101, which will be crucial to accommodate future growth in the vicinity, including the future
BART station at the San Jose Flea Market site. To fund these necessary interchange improvements, the
City has developed the US 101/Oakland/Mabury Transportation Development Policy (TDP).
The purpose of the US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP is to provide additional needed freeway access
capacity at the US 101/Oakland Road interchange in order to accommodate new mixed-use, commercial
and residential development, and to provide incentives for new industrial development in the areas of San
Jose generally surrounding the interchange that otherwise would not be possible due to existing capacity
constraints. The result of the City Council’s approval of the US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP is a change to
the normal sequence of events, allowing one or more projects to develop and generate traffic congestion



                                                                                              4 | Page

in excess of the City’s Level of Service Policy standard for a temporary period of time prior to construction
of the required transportation improvements.
As part of the new Policy, a fee to fund the planned interchange improvements has been adopted. The
fee is based on PM peak hour vehicle trips generated by a project. Any project that would add traffic to
the US 101/Oakland Road interchange is required to participate in the TDP program. The TDP includes a
fee schedule requiring all new developments to pay a “fair share” contribution for using a portion of the
interchange capacity that would be created with buildout of the US 101/Oakland Road interchange and
construction of a new US 101/Mabury Road interchange. Unlike most Area Development Policies that
base their fees on the number of residential units or square footages built, the fee for the US
101/Oakland/ Mabury TDP is based on the number of PM peak hour vehicular trips that would be added
to the US 101/Oakland Road interchange. Currently, the TDP traffic impact fee is $34,913 per each new
PM peak hour vehicle trip that would be added to the US 101/Oakland Road interchange. Projects are
required to pay the traffic impact fee prior to Public Works clearance.

Study Methodology
This section describes the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, the City of San Jose, the CMP
Annual Monitoring Report, previous traffic studies and field observations. The following data were
collected from these sources:

   existing traffic volumes
   approved project trips
   intersection lane configurations
   signal timing and phasing
   average speeds on freeway segments

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The various analysis methods are
described below.

City of San Jose Intersections
The City of San Jose level of service methodology for signalized intersections is the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) method. This method is applied using the TRAFFIX software. The 2000 HCM
operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average control delay time
for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersection level of service
methodology, the City of San Jose methodology employs the CMP default values for the analysis
parameters.
The proposed project is subject to the City’s Transportation Level of Service Policy for areas outside the
Downtown Core Area. The City of San Jose level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS D
or better. The correlation between average control delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.

CMP Intersections
The designated level of service methodology for the CMP also is the 2000 HCM operations method for
signalized intersections, using TRAFFIX. The only difference in level of service standards is that in the
City of San Jose the standard is LOS D or better, and the CMP level of service standard for signalized
intersections is LOS E or better.

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the
    A       green phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to       10.0 or less
            the very low vehicle delay.

            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle
    B       lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average        10.1 to 20.0
            vehicle delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
    C                                                                                            20.1 to 35.0
            of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the
            intersection without stopping.

            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
            result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
    D                                                                                            35.1 to 55.0
            lenghts, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
            individual cycle failures are noticeable.

            This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
    E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high             55.1 to 80.0
            volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
     F                                                                                         greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may
            also be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Intersection Operations
The analysis of intersection level of service is often supplemented with an analysis of intersection
operations for selected intersections where the project would add a significant number of left-turning
vehicles. The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand turning-movements at
intersections. Vehicle queues are estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the
probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
                  P (x=n) =       n e – (
                                     n!
         where:
                  P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
                  n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
                  Avg. # of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-
turn storage requirements at signalized intersections.

                                                                                                 6 | Page 
 Cannery Park Village                                                                        July 9, 2015 


The 95th percentile queue length value indicates that during the peak hour, a queue of this length or less
would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue length larger than the 95th percentile queue
would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a
60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-turn storage pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue
length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile
queue length is also known as the “design queue length.”

Unsignalized Intersections
One of the study intersections is unsignalized: North Ninth Street and Taylor Street. The need for
signalization of unsignalized intersections is assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant
3) described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4). This
method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication whether
vehicular peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal.
Intersections that meet the peak hour warrant are subject to further analysis before determining that a
traffic signal is necessary. Additional analysis may include unsignalized level of service analysis and/or
operational analysis such as evaluating vehicle queuing and delay. Other types of traffic control devices,
signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing field conditions and intersection
spacing.

Freeway Segments
According to CMP guidelines, an analysis of freeway segment levels of service is required if a project is
estimated to add trips to a freeway segment equal to or greater than one percent of the capacity of that
segment. Since the number of project trips added to the freeways in the area is expected to be above the
one percent threshold, a detailed analysis of freeway segment levels of service was performed. As
prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated based
on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:
                 D = V / (N*S)
        where:
                 D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                 V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                 N= number of travel lanes
                 S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)
The vehicle density on a freeway segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 2. The CMP
specifies that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for mixed-flow lane segments
that are three lanes or wider in one direction, and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl be used for mixed-flow lane
segments that are two lanes wide in one direction. A capacity of 1,800 vphpl was used for high
occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as
LOS E or better.

General Plan Transportation Policies
The Circulation Element of the Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan includes a set of balanced, long-
range, multi modal transportation goals and policies that provide for a transportation network that is safe,
efficient and sustainable (minimizes environmental, financial, and neighborhood impacts). These
transportation goals and policies are intended to improve multi-modal accessibility to all land uses and
create a city where people are less reliant on driving to meet their daily needs. San Jose’s Transportation
Goals, Policies and Actions aim to:

       Establish circulation policies that increase bicycle, pedestrian and transit travel while reducing
        motor vehicle trips to increase the City’s share of travel by alternative transportation modes.
       Promote San Jose as a walking and bicycling-first city by providing and prioritizing funding for
        projects that enhance and improve bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

           Speeds at the free-flow speed are generally maintained. The ability to maneuver
    B      within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted, and the general level of physical         11.1 to 18.0
           and psychological comfort provided to drivers is still high.

           Speeds at or near the free-flow speed of the freeway prevail. Freedom to maneuver

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Also included
are the existing levels of service of the key intersections and freeway segments in the study area.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided by SR 87, US 101 and I-880. These facilities are described
below.
SR 87 is primarily a six-lane freeway (four mixed-flow lanes and two HOV lanes) that is aligned in a north-
south orientation within the project vicinity. SR 87 begins at its interchange with SR 85 and extends
northward, terminating at its junction with US 101. Access to the project site to and from SR 87 is
provided via a full interchange at Taylor Street.
US 101 is an eight-lane freeway (three mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane in each direction) in the
vicinity of the site. US 101 extends northward through San Francisco and southward through Gilroy.
Access to and from the site is provided via interchanges at Julian Street/McKee Road, Oakland Road,
Old Bayshore Highway, and SR 87.
I-880 is a six-lane freeway in the vicinity of the site. It extends northeast to Oakland and south to I-280 in
San Jose, at which point it makes a transition into SR 17 to Santa Cruz. Access to the project study area
is provided via its interchanges with Old Bayshore Highway, North First Street, and US 101.
Local access to the project site is provided via Hedding Street, Taylor Street, Jackson Street, Julian
Street, St. James Street, North First Street, North Fourth Street, North Sixth Street, North Seventh Street,
North Tenth Street, North Eleventh Street, and North Thirteenth Street/Oakland Road.
Hedding Street is a four-lane, east-west street identified as an On-Street Primary Bicycle Facility in the
City of San Jose’s General Plan. It begins at Winchester Boulevard as a transition from Pruneridge
Avenue. Hedding extends eastward to US 101, where it changes designation to Berryessa Road.
Taylor Street is a two-lane, east/west Local Connector Street that begins at The Alameda as a transition
from Naglee Avenue and extends eastward into east San Jose. Taylor Street changes designation to
Mabury Road at the US 101 overcrossing. Taylor Street provides full access to SR 87 and provides direct
access to the project site.
Jackson Street is an east-west, two-lane Local Connector Street that extends eastward from North First
Street, ultimately terminating at Watson Park. Jackson Street provides access to the project site via North
Ninth Street.


                                                                                               9 | Page

Julian Street is primarily a one-way westbound two-lane Local Connector Street within the downtown
area. West and east of the downtown core at SR 87 and at 19th Street, respectively, Julian Street is
generally a two-way, two-lane facility. Julian Street provides full access to US 101.
St. James Street is exclusively a one-way eastbound two-lane Local Connector Street within the
downtown area that extends from SR 87 to 19th Street.
North First Street is a two- to four-lane divided Local Connector Street with a raised center median, upon
which the Guadalupe Corridor Light Rail Transit line operates. South First Street begins at Alma Avenue
as a transition from Monterey Road, and extends northward where it turns into North First Street at Santa
Clara Street. North First Street extends into North San Jose where it terminates at Gold Street north of
SR 237. North First Street provides full access to I-880 and provides access to the project site via Taylor
Street.
North Fourth Street is a north-south, four-lane divided Local Connector Street north of Jackson Street.
South of Jackson, North Fourth Street is a one-way arterial with three-lanes. North Fourth Street begins
at Old Bayshore Highway and extends southward, terminating at I-280 as South First Street. North Fourth
Street provides access to the site via Taylor Street.
North Sixth Street is a north-south, two-lane Residential Street within the project area. North Sixth Street
begins at Santa Clara Street and extends northward, terminating just north of Younger Avenue. North
Sixth Street provides access to the project site via Taylor Street.
North Seventh Street is a north-south, two-lane Local Connector Street within the project area. North
Seventh Street begins at Santa Clara Street and extends northward to Commercial Street. South of Santa
Clara Street it becomes South Seventh Street and extends to Tully Road, although no connection exists
between San Salvador and San Fernando Streets (at the SJSU campus). North Seventh Street provides
access to the project site via Taylor Street.
North Tenth Street is a one-way, three-lane southbound Local Connector Street between Hedding Street
and Keyes Street. North of Hedding Street, North Tenth Street becomes a two-way four-lane arterial up to
its termination point at I-880. South of Santa Clara Street it becomes South Tenth Street. South of Keyes
Street the roadway becomes a two-way four-lane roadway to its termination point at Tully Road. North
Tenth Street provides access to the project site via Taylor Street.
North Eleventh Street is a north-south three-lane Local Connector Street that runs from Keyes Street to
Hedding Street. North Eleventh Street is one-way in the northbound direction. North Eleventh Street
provides access to the project site via Taylor Street.
Thirteenth Street is generally a north-south two-lane Local Connector Street that extends from Margaret
Street in downtown San Jose to Hedding Street, where it changes designation to Oakland Road. The
North/South designation of Thirteenth Street changes at Santa Clara Street. Thirteenth Street provides
access to the project site via Taylor Street.
Oakland Road is a north-south Main Street that begins at Hedding Street in the south as a transition from
North Thirteenth Street, and continues to Montague Expressway where it becomes South Main Street in
the north. North of US 101, Oakland Road is primarily a two lane roadway with a two-way center left-turn
lane. South of US 101, Oakland Road is a four lane arterial until its intersection with Hedding Street,
where it becomes a two lane roadway. Oakland Road has a full interchange with US 101.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist mostly of sidewalks along the streets in the immediate vicinity of the project
site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are located at all of the signalized
intersections in the study area. While the network of sidewalks in the study area is extensive, sidewalks
currently do not exist on the east side of North Seventh Street between Taylor Street and Jackson Street.
However, the development currently under construction on the east side of Seventh Street will be adding
sidewalk to this roadway segment. Overall, the existing network of sidewalks has good connectivity and
provides pedestrians with safe routes to the surrounding land uses and transit services in the area.

Class II bicycle facilities (striped bike lanes) exist in the vicinity of the project site (see Figure 2). Bike
lanes are provided along Hedding Street, Taylor Street west of North First Street, Empire Street, North
Third and Fourth Streets south of Jackson Street, North Seventh Street north of Hedding Street and south
of Empire Street, and along North Tenth and North Eleventh Streets. North Seventh Street between
Hedding Street and Empire Street is an identified bike route. The project site is located approximately ¾
of a mile from the Civic Center LRT station, and bicycles are permitted on LRT trains.
Taylor Street provides a direct connection to the Guadalupe River trail system, approximately 1 mile west
of the project site at Guadalupe Gardens. The Guadalupe River trail system is an 11-mile paved trail that
runs through the City of San Jose along the Guadalupe River and is shared with pedestrians and
separated from motor vehicle traffic. The Guadalupe River trail is a continuous Class I bikeway from
Curtner Avenue in the south to Alviso in the north.

Existing Transit Services
Existing transit services in the study area are provided by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA) and are described below. The local bus lines and Light Rail Transit (LRT) stations that serve the
project study area are shown on Figure 3.

VTA Bus Service
The VTA bus lines that operate within the study area are listed in Table 3, including their terminus points
and commute hour headways. Local Routes 12, 61 and 62 run along North Tenth and Taylor Streets and
stop adjacent to the project site on North Tenth Street. The 12 line provides limited weekend service only
between the Eastridge Transit Center and the San Jose Civic Center, with 30-minute headways all day.

VTA Light Rail Transit (LRT) Service
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) currently operates the 42.2-mile VTA light rail line
system extending from south San Jose through downtown to the northern areas of San Jose, Santa
Clara, Milpitas, Mountain View and Sunnyvale, as well as Campbell. The service operates nearly 24-
hours a day with 15-minute headways during the peak commute periods of the day.
The project site is located about ¾ of a mile from the Civic Center LRT station. Weekday LRT service at
this station is provided from approximately 4:45 AM to 12:45 AM the following morning, with 15-minute
headways between about 4:45 AM and 10:30 AM, and again between about 2:00 PM and 9:00 PM. LRT
trains stop at this station every 30 minutes the remainder of the weekday. Weekend LRT service at this
station is provided from about 6:20 AM to 12:40 AM the next morning, with 30-minute headways all day.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were confirmed by observations in the field and
are shown on Figure 4.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes are obtained from the City of San Jose whenever possible.
VTA provides existing PM peak hour traffic volumes for CMP-designated intersections. If the available
count data are more than approximately two years old, new manual turning-movement counts typically
are conducted during the AM and PM peak hours at non-CMP intersections and during the AM peak hour
only at CMP intersections in order to adequately document existing field conditions at the time the traffic
study is being prepared. The new traffic counts are compared against historical count data for
consistency and accuracy and incorporated into the City’s traffic volume database, if approved by the
City. The purpose of the database is to provide consistent traffic volumes within similar timeframes and
areas for all projects requiring traffic analysis. This ensures the base traffic conditions are the same for all
projects. If conditions arise that cause the new count data to be inconsistent with the City’s historical
database due to field conditions or economic variability, the City may decide to use previous count data
that reflect more typical traffic conditions.
For the purpose of this traffic study, existing weekday AM (7:00-9:00 AM) and PM (4:00-6:00 PM) peak-
hour traffic volumes were obtained from the City of San Jose and CMP traffic count databases and
supplemented with new 2014 manual turning-movement counts. All new count data used in this traffic
study have been reviewed and approved by the City of San Jose.
Existing peak-hour traffic volumes are shown on Figure 5. New count data are included in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. The results of
the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 4.

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of
service policy, all of the study intersections currently operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D or
better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the CMP standards, all of the
study CMP intersections currently operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS E or better) during both
the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Existing Freeway Segment Levels of Service
Traffic volumes for the study freeway segments were obtained from the 2012 CMP Annual Monitoring
Report, which contains the most recent data collected for freeway segments located in Santa Clara
County. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 5. The results show that the following
freeway segments currently operate at an unacceptable LOS F during at least one of the peak hours of
traffic as indicated below:
        SR 87, northbound between Julian Street and Coleman Avenue – AM peak hour
        SR 87, northbound between Coleman Avenue and Taylor Street – AM peak hour
        SR 87, northbound between Skyport Drive and US 101 – AM peak hour
        SR 87, southbound between US 101 and Skyport Drive – PM peak hour
        SR 87, southbound between Skyport Drive and Taylor Street – PM peak hour
        SR 87, southbound between Taylor Street and Coleman Avenue – PM peak hour
        SR 87, southbound between Coleman Avenue and Julian Street – PM peak hour
        SR 87, southbound between Julian Street and I-280 – PM peak hour
        US 101, northbound between Santa Clara Street and McKee Road – AM peak hour
        US 101, northbound between McKee Road and Oakland Road – AM peak hour
        US 101, northbound between Oakland Road and I-880 – AM peak hour
        US 101, northbound between I-880 and Old Bayshore Highway – AM peak hour
        US 101, northbound between Old Bayshore Highway and North First Street – AM peak hour
        US 101, northbound between North First Street and SR 87 – AM peak hour
        US 101, southbound between SR 87 and North First Street – PM peak hour
        US 101, southbound between North First Street and Old Bayshore Highway – PM peak hour
        US 101, southbound between Old Bayshore Highway and I-880 – PM peak hour
        US 101, southbound between I-880 and Oakland Road – PM peak hour
        US 101, southbound between Oakland Road and McKee Road – PM peak hour
        I-880, northbound between Coleman Avenue and SR 87 – AM peak hour
        I-880, northbound between North First Street and US 101 – AM peak hour
        I-880, northbound between US 101 and Brokaw Road – AM peak hour
        I-880, southbound between Brokaw Road and US 101 – PM peak hour
        I-880, southbound between North First Street and SR 87 – PM peak hour
        I-880, southbound between SR 87 and Coleman Avenue – PM peak hour

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions were observed in the field to identify existing operational deficiencies and to confirm the
accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic
problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the
level of service analysis does not accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.
AM and PM field observations revealed that overall the study intersections operate well, and the level of
service calculations accurately reflect existing conditions. However, field observations revealed that some
minor operational problems currently occur that may not be reflected in the intersection level of service
calculations, as indicated below.

SR 87 and Taylor Street
During the AM peak hour, the westbound left-turn movement from Taylor Street onto southbound SR 87
occasionally spills out of the left-turn pocket. As a result, it occasionally requires two signal cycles for all
westbound left-turning vehicles to clear the intersection. Eastbound through traffic on Taylor Street
received heavy volume from the SR 87 northbound off-ramp, and vehicle queues occasionally extend
back to the off-ramp.
During the PM peak hour, the on-ramp to southbound SR 87 is metered. As a result of vehicle stacking
on the on-ramp, vehicles turning left onto southbound SR 87 from westbound Taylor Street consistently
block eastbound through traffic on Taylor Street. However, this situation does not last long and eastbound
traffic on Taylor Street is able to clear the intersection in one signal cycle.

North First Street and I-880 Ramps
During the AM peak hour, northbound North First Street experiences relatively heavy traffic volume.
Northbound left-turn traffic at the intersection of North First Street and East Rosemary Street occasionally
spills out of the left-turn pocket and momentarily blocks the I-880 southbound off-ramp.
During the PM peak hour, long southbound vehicle queues occasionally develop on North First Street at
the southbound ramps due to the metered I-880 on-ramp.
North First Street experiences relatively heavy volumes in the northbound direction during the AM peak
hour, but all of the northbound vehicles clear the I-880 intersections in one signal cycle.

North First Street and Hedding Street
During the AM peak hour, westbound through traffic on Hedding Street consistently queues past North
Fourth Street, but the queue clears in one signal cycle. The eastbound left-turn pocket consistently fills
and occasionally spills out of the turn pocket, but also clears in one signal cycle.
During the PM peak hour, eastbound Hedding Street experiences heavy traffic volume and the eastbound
left-turn pocket consistently overflows and blocks through traffic. Heavy southbound traffic on First Street
results in long vehicle queues that frequently extend well past Younger Avenue due to delays at Taylor
Street.
Delays due to the LRT on North First Street occasionally occur during the AM peak hour. Also during the
AM peak hour the eastbound approach has heavy volumes, but all vehicles clear the intersection in one
signal cycle.

North First Street and Taylor Street
During the AM peak hour, eastbound traffic consistently backs up past San Pedro Street. As a result, it
often takes two signal cycles for all of the queued eastbound vehicles to clear the intersection.
Westbound through traffic on Taylor Street consistently queues past North Third Street and requires two
signal cycles for all vehicles to clear the intersection. There is an imbalance in lane usage on westbound
Taylor Street. The curb lane (right lane) develops significantly lengthier queues than the inside lane (left
lane) because the curb lane ultimately feeds the on-ramp to northbound SR 87.
During the PM peak hour, eastbound traffic consistently queues past San Pedro Street, causing a backup
on the SR 87 northbound off-ramp. Queues often require two signal cycles to clear. The southbound left-
turn vehicle queue frequently extends out of the turn pocket in the PM, blocking the single through traffic
lane. In addition, much of the traffic in the southbound through lane turns right onto westbound Taylor
Street towards SR 87. This further impedes the southbound traffic flow. As a result, southbound through
traffic consistently queues past Hedding Street and requires at least two signal cycles to clear.

North Fourth Street and Hedding Street
During the AM peak hour, westbound through traffic occasionally blocks the intersection due to delays at
North First Street and Hedding Street, but all vehicles typically clear the intersection in one signal cycle.
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound vehicle queues are lengthy and occasionally block the
intersection, but all vehicles typically clear the intersection in one signal cycle.

North Fourth Street and Taylor Street
During the AM peak hour, westbound through traffic on Taylor Street consistently queues past North Fifth
Street. As a result, the northbound left-turn movement at North Fifth Street and Taylor Street is blocked at
times. Additional delays occur on westbound Taylor Street when buses are stopped at this intersection.
During the PM peak hour, long eastbound vehicle queues frequently develop due to heavy eastbound
traffic volume. The vehicle queues frequently extend past North Third Street. The southbound left-turn



                                                                                            22 | Page

vehicle queues occasionally spill out of the turn pocket, but all vehicles typically clear the intersection in
one signal cycle.

North Tenth Street and Hedding Street
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound vehicle queues on Hedding Street frequently back up to North
Fourth Street. As a result, it takes two signal cycles for all vehicles to clear the intersections along
Hedding Street.

North Tenth Street and Taylor Street
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound vehicle queues on Taylor Street at North Tenth Street
consistently back up past the North Ninth Street/Taylor Street intersection. Since these intersections are
spaced only 300 feet apart, left turns from the project driveway and from North Ninth Street are blocked.

North Eleventh Street and Hedding Street
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound vehicle queues on Hedding Street frequently back up to North
Fourth Street. When this occurs, it takes two signal cycles for all vehicles to clear the intersections along
Hedding Street.

North Thirteenth Street and Hedding Street
During the AM peak hour, westbound through traffic on Hedding Street consistently queues past North
17th Street and requires two signal cycles to clear the intersection. Eastbound left-turn traffic occasionally
spills out of the left-turn pocket but all vehicles clear in one signal cycle.
During the PM peak hour, the eastbound left-turn vehicle queues frequently spill out of the left-turn
pocket. As a result, it often takes two signal cycles for all vehicles to clear the intersection.

Oakland Road and US 101 Ramps
Observations show that vehicle queues for every movement at the US 101 interchange with Oakland
Road are lengthy and extend out of the existing storage pockets during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Not all vehicles clear during their allotted green times. The problems at the interchange are due to the
physical constraints (close intersection spacing and inadequate capacity) of the interchange to serve the
large demand. The vehicle queues also affect Oakland Road/Commercial Street intersection operations,
since these intersections are so close together.
During the AM peak hour, northbound Oakland Road experiences heavy traffic volume and long vehicle
queues, due in large part to the high left-turn movement demand onto northbound US 101. Intersections
on the overpass experience a relatively high volume of truck traffic. Their wide turn requirements and
slower speeds impede the normal flow of traffic at these intersections. Northbound left-turn vehicle
queues at the intersection of Commercial Street and Oakland Road occasionally spill out of the turn
pocket, blocking through traffic. Since the southbound left-turn lane on Oakland Road at the south ramps
feeds the on-ramp to southbound US 101, southbound vehicle queues frequently extend past
Commercial Street.
During the PM peak hour, southbound Oakland Road experiences heavy traffic volume and long vehicle
queues, due in large part to the high left-turn movement demand onto southbound US 101. Many of the
turning movements at the interchange and at the Oakland Road/Commercial Street intersection require
two signal cycles for all vehicles to clear. Left-turn traffic from westbound Commercial Street onto
southbound Oakland Road consistently blocks the intersection due to delays at the US 101 southbound
on-ramp.
The remaining study intersections and transportation system were not observed to have any operational
problems.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes existing plus project traffic conditions, including the method by which project traffic
is estimated. Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially occur if the project were to be
occupied prior to the other approved projects in the area. It is unlikely that this traffic condition would
occur, since other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely be built and
occupied during the time the project is going through the development review process.

Transportation Network Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions would
be the same as the existing transportation network.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets. These procedures are described further in the following sections.

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that quantify the amount of traffic produced by
common land uses. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation rates that
can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new development. The
magnitude of traffic added to the roadway system by a particular development is estimated by multiplying
the applicable trip generation rates by the size of the development. Trip generation resulting from new
development proposed within the City of San Jose typically is estimated using the trip rates published in
the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) manual entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition (2012).

Existing Trip Credits
For the existing plus project scenario, trips that are generated by existing occupied uses to be removed
can be subtracted from the gross project trip generation estimates. Currently, 155,347 s.f. of the existing
commercial and warehouse uses on the project site that would be removed as part of the project are
occupied. The AM and PM peak hour trip generation of the existing occupied uses were counted on
October 28, 2014. The trips associated with the historical Continental Can Company warehouse building
were not included in the existing trip credits, since this building would remain on the site and continue to
accommodate commercial and related uses.

                                                                                            24 | Page

Other Trip Reductions
A mixed-use development with complementary land uses such as residential and retail will generate and
attract trips internally between the uses. Thus, the number of vehicle trips generated for each use may be
reduced, since a portion of the trips would not require entering or exiting the site. The VTA’s Congestion
Management Program Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines (March 2009) indicates a trip reduction
of up to 15 percent is allowed for residential and retail mixed-use developments. The reduction is applied
to the smaller of the two complimentary trip generators (retail use), and the same number of trips is then
subtracted from the larger trip generator (residential use) to account for both trip ends.
A retail pass-by trip reduction of 25 percent (typical for Santa Clara County) also can be applied to the net
peak hour trip generation estimates for the proposed retail space. Pass-by-trips are trips that would
already be on the adjacent roadways (and so are already counted in the background traffic) but would
turn into the site while passing by. Justification for applying the pass-by-trip reduction is founded on the
observation that such retail traffic is not actually generated by the retail development, but is already part
of the ambient traffic levels.
Net Project Trips
After applying the standard ITE trip generation rates, existing trip credits, and appropriate trip reductions,
the proposed project would generate 1,926 new daily vehicle trips, with 148 new trips occurring during the
AM peak hour and 155 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/outbound splits
recommended by ITE, the project would produce 2 additional inbound trips and 146 additional outbound
trips during the AM peak hour, and 124 additional inbound trips and 31 additional outbound trips during
the PM peak hour compared to the existing uses on the site to be removed. Table 6 shows the project trip
generation estimates under existing plus project conditions.

Trip Distribution Patterns
In order to be consistent with the previous 2010 traffic study prepared for the project site, the trip
distribution pattern for the project was developed based on existing travel patterns on the surrounding
roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. Two separate trip distribution patterns
were applied to the proposed land uses of the site: 1) Residential, and 2) Retail. Figure 6 shows the
project trip distribution patterns.

Trip Assignment
The peak hour vehicle trips generated by the project were assigned to the roadway network in
accordance with the trip distribution patterns. Based on the project site’s close proximity to freeways,
specifically SR 87, US 101 and I-880, 60 percent of the estimated residential project trips were assigned
to and from the freeways. The remaining 40 percent of residential trips were distributed relatively evenly
among the surrounding roadways. It was assumed that the proposed retail use primarily would serve local
residents of Japantown and the surrounding neighborhoods. Thus, no project trips related to the retail use
were assigned to and from the freeways. The trips generated by the existing uses were subtracted from
the roadway network prior to assigning the project trips.
Figure 7 shows the gross project trip assignment for the residential units. The retail gross trip assignment
is shown on Figure 8. Figure 9 shows the trips generated by the existing occupied commercial uses. The
net project trips under existing plus project conditions are shown on Figure 10.

Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The project trips were added to existing traffic volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes (see
Figure 11). Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. The results of
the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are summarized in Table 7.

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions show that, measured
against the City of San Jose level of service standards, all of the study intersections would operate at an
acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions show that, measured
against the CMP standards, all of the study CMP intersections would operate at an acceptable level of
service (LOS E or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed project. Traffic volumes for background conditions comprise volumes from
existing traffic counts plus traffic generated by other approved developments in the vicinity of the site.
This chapter describes the procedure used to determine background traffic volumes and the resulting
traffic conditions. The background scenario predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as
approved development gets built and occupied.

Background Transportation Network
It was assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would be the
same as the existing network.

Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak hour volumes the
estimated traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments. The added traffic from approved
but not yet constructed developments in the City of San Jose was obtained from the City’s Approved
Trips Inventory (ATI). The ATI lists each approved project and the trips associated with the approved
project for each intersection. The ATI is contained in Appendix B.
In addition to the City’s ATI, trips that could potentially be generated by re-occupancy of the existing
vacant portion of the Continental Can Company building that will remain on the site were estimated and
added to existing traffic volumes. The potential trips were estimated based on the building’s current
vacancy rate and counts of the project site conducted on October 28, 2014. Currently, 43,760 s.f. of the
59,847 square-foot historical building are occupied, leaving 16,087 s.f. vacant. Based on the count data,
the existing vacant space has the potential to generate 9 AM peak hour trips (7 inbound and 2 outbound)
and 7 PM peak hour trips (3 inbound and 4 outbound).
Background traffic volumes are shown graphically on Figure 12. Traffic volumes for all components of
traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Background Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. The results of
the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized in Table 8.




                                                                                            39 | Page

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under background conditions show that, measured against the
City of San Jose level of service policy, all but four of the study intersections would operate at an
acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The
following four intersections would operate at LOS E or F during at least one of the peak hours of traffic:
       North First Street/Taylor Street (Protected Intersection) – LOS F during the PM peak hour
       Old Oakland Road/US 101 NB Ramps (CMP Intersection) – LOS F during the AM peak hour and
        LOS E during the PM peak hour
       Old Oakland Road/US 101 SB Ramps (CMP Intersection) – LOS F during the PM peak hour
       North Thirteenth Street/Hedding Street (Protected Intersection) – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under background conditions show that, measured against the
CMP standards, all but two CMP intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS E or
better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The following two CMP intersections would
operate at LOS F during one of the peak hours of traffic as indicated below:
       Old Oakland Road/US 101 NB Ramps – LOS F during the AM peak hour
       Old Oakland Road/US 101 SB Ramps – LOS F during the PM peak hour
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Background Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes near-term traffic conditions that most likely would occur when the project is
complete. It includes a description of the significance criteria used to establish what constitutes a project
impact, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts caused by the project.
Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to
determine potential project impacts. This traffic scenario represents a more congested traffic condition
than the existing plus project scenario, since it includes traffic generated by approved but not yet built
projects in the area.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used
to determine significant impacts on signalized intersections are based on City of San Jose Level of
Service standards. The City of San Jose LOS Policy is the adopted threshold for CEQA. Project impacts
on CMP study intersections and freeway segments were analyzed according to the County Congestion
Management Program (CMP) methodology.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of San Jose if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project conditions,
       or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by one percent (.01) or more, or
    3. The level of service at a designated Protected Intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under
       background conditions and the addition of project trips causes the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C)
       to increase by one-half percent (.005) or more.
An exception to rule #2 above applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

                                                                                             44 | Page 
 Cannery Park Village                                                                        July 9, 2015 


CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San Jose, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better. Thus, a
CMP intersection that operates at LOS F would fail to meet the CMP level of service standard.
CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts
The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better. A project is
said to create a significant impact on traffic conditions on a freeway segment if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better under
       existing conditions to an unacceptable LOS F with the addition of project trips, or
    2. The level of service on the freeway segment is already operating at an unacceptable LOS F and
       the number of project trips added to the segment constitutes at least one percent of capacity of
       the segment.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to existing conditions or better.

Transportation Network Under Background Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background plus project conditions
would be the same as the existing transportation network.

Project Trip Estimates
As described in Chapter 3, the trip rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE)
manual entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition (2012) were used to estimate the project trip generation.
According to City of San Jose policy, trip credits can be given under background plus project conditions
for existing buildings to be removed, whether they are occupied or vacant, so as not to underestimate an
existing site’s potential for generating trips. Currently, 155,347 s.f. of the total existing commercial and
warehouse uses (182,332 s.f.) on the site that would be removed as part of the project are occupied. This
represents a 14.8 percent vacancy rate. The AM and PM peak hour trip generation of the existing
occupied uses was counted on October 28, 2014. The resulting trip generation rates for the occupied
uses to be removed were applied to the vacant uses on the site. Note that the trips associated with the
historical Continental Can Company warehouse building were not included in the existing trip credits,
since this building would remain on the site and continue to accommodate commercial and related uses.
After applying the standard ITE trip generation rates, existing trip credits, and appropriate trip reductions,
the proposed project would generate 1,797 new daily vehicle trips, with 138 new trips occurring during the
AM peak hour and 139 new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. Using the inbound/outbound splits
recommended by ITE, the project would produce 5 fewer inbound trips and 143 additional outbound trips
during the AM peak hour, and 118 additional inbound trips and 21 additional outbound trips during the PM
peak hour compared to the existing uses on the site to be removed. Table 9 shows the project trip
generation estimates under background plus project conditions.

Background Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The peak hour vehicle trips generated by the project were assigned to the roadway network in
accordance with the trip distribution patterns as described in Chapter 3. Figures 7 and 8 in Chapter 3
show the gross trip assignments for the residential and retail components of the project, respectively. The
net peak hour project trips (shown on Figure 13) were added to background traffic volumes to obtain
background plus project traffic volumes (shown on Figure 14).
Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.

Intersection LOS Under Background Plus Project Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. Table 10
shows the results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus project conditions.

/c/ Based on ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition (2012), "Shopping Center" rates (Land Use 820). Average rates were applied.
/d/ A 15% residential/retail mixed-use trip reduction was applied to the project per the Santa Clara VTA TIA Guidelines, March 2009.
    The 15% trip reduction was first applied to the smaller trip generator (retail). The same number of trips were then subtracted from
    the larger trip generator (residential) to account for both trip ends.
/e/ A pass-by trip reduction of 25% was applied to the retail component of the project. The reduction was applied to the net retail
    project trips after applying the residential/retail mixed-use reduction.
/f/ The AM and PM peak hour trip generation of the existing occupied uses to be removed are based on driveway counts conducted on
    October 28, 2014. Daily trips were estimated. When the existing site trips were counted, the site had a 14.8% vacancy rate. The trips
    associated with the historical Continental Can Company warehouse building were not included in the existing trip credits, since
    this building would remain on the site and continue to accommodate commercial and related uses.



City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under background plus project conditions show that, measured
against the City of San Jose level of service policy, all but four of the study intersections would operate at
an acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The
following four intersections would operate at LOS E or F during at least one of the peak hours of traffic:
          North First Street/Taylor Street (Protected Intersection) – LOS F during the PM peak hour
          Old Oakland Road/US 101 NB Ramps (CMP Intersection) – LOS F during the AM peak hour and
           LOS E during the PM peak hour
          Old Oakland Road/US 101 SB Ramps (CMP Intersection) – LOS F during the PM peak hour
          North Thirteenth Street/Hedding Street (Protected Intersection) – LOS E during the AM peak hour

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under background plus project conditions show that, measured
against the CMP standards, all but two CMP intersections would operate at an acceptable level of service
(LOS E or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The following two CMP intersections
would operate at LOS F during one of the peak hours of traffic as indicated below:
          Old Oakland Road/US 101 NB Ramps – LOS F during the AM peak hour
          Old Oakland Road/US 101 SB Ramps – LOS F during the PM peak hour
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Intersection Impacts
When measured against the City of San Jose significant impact criteria, the following two Protected
Intersections would be significantly impacted by the project:
                     North First Street and Taylor Street
                     North Thirteenth Street and Hedding Street


                                                                                                          51 | Page 
 Cannery Park Village                                                                       July 9, 2015 


North First Street and Taylor Street
The level of service at this intersection would be an unacceptable LOS F during the PM peak hour under
background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the volume-to-capacity
(V/C) ratio to increase by 0.019 (more than the 0.005 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of
service impact criteria for protected intersections, this constitutes a significant project impact.

North Thirteenth Street and Hedding Street
The level of service at this intersection would be an unacceptable LOS E during the AM peak hour under
background conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the volume-to-capacity
(V/C) ratio to increase by 0.007 (more than the 0.005 threshold). Based on the City of San Jose level of
service impact criteria for protected intersections, this constitutes a significant project impact.

Protected Intersection Requirements (Mitigation)
The study intersections of North First Street/Taylor Street and North Thirteenth Street/Hedding Street
have been identified as City of San Jose Protected Intersections. Protected Intersections consist of
locations that have been built to their planned maximum capacity and where expansion of the intersection
would have an adverse effect upon other transportation facilities (such as pedestrian, bicycle, transit
systems, etc.). Protected Intersections are, therefore, not required to maintain a Level of Service D, which
is the City of San Jose standard. The deficiencies at all 25 Protected Intersections in the City of San Jose
have been disclosed and overridden in previous EIRs.
If a development project has significant traffic impacts at a designated Protected Intersection, the project
may be approved if offsetting Transportation System Improvements are provided. The offsetting
improvements are intended to provide other transportation benefits for the community adjacent to the
traffic impact. The improvements may include enhancements to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities,
as well as neighborhood traffic calming measures and other roadway improvements.
The City will identify the specific offsetting improvements, which should be agreed upon by the
community. Priority is given to improvements identified in previously adopted plans such as area-wide
specific or master plans, redevelopment plans, or plans prepared through the Strong Neighborhoods
Initiative. Community outreach should occur in conjunction with the project review and approval process.
Once the specific improvements have been identified, the developer must submit improvement plans to
the City of San Jose Department of Public Works for review and approval. The specific offsetting
improvements proposed can be finalized during the subsequent planning permit stages and can be
described in the Final EIR.
The LOS Policy has established a fee equal to $2,821 per net peak hour project trip for one Protected
Intersection impact and $4,232 per net peak hour project trip for two or more Protected Intersection
impacts to fund alternative transportation improvements. For the purpose of determining the Protected
Intersection LOS impact fee, net peak hour project trips are defined as the total number of peak hour trips
generated by the project during the highest peak hour period after all appropriate trip credits have been
applied. The value of the improvements should be equal to the established fees. Since the project
significantly impacts two Protected Intersections, the current estimated project cost is $4,232 times 139
net PM peak hour trips.
                Estimated Protected Intersection Impact Fee: $588,248

US 101/Oakland/Mabury Transportation Development Policy (TDP)
The City of San Jose has identified operational problems along the Oakland Road corridor at the US 101
interchange, which are due primarily to the capacity constraints of the interchange. The interchange’s
current configuration is inadequate to serve the vehicular demand due to it serving as the main gateway
into the Oakland Road area and as the only route across US 101. As a result, the City has identified two
key capital improvement projects: 1) modification of the US 101/Oakland Road interchange, including
improvements to the Oakland Road/Commercial Street intersection, and 2) construction of a new US
101/Mabury Road interchange. Both interchange projects will create additional capacity for accessing and

                                                                                           52 | Page 
 Cannery Park Village                                                                        July 9, 2015 


crossing US 101, which will be crucial to accommodate future growth in the vicinity, including the future
BART station at the San Jose Flea Market site. To fund these necessary interchange improvements, the
City has developed the US 101/Oakland/Mabury Transportation Development Policy (TDP).
As part of the new Policy, a fee to fund the planned interchange improvements has been adopted. The
fee is based on PM peak hour vehicle trips generated by a project. Any project that would add traffic to
the US 101/Oakland Road interchange is required to participate in the TDP program. The TDP includes a
fee schedule requiring all new developments to pay a “fair share” contribution for using a portion of the
interchange capacity that would be created with buildout of the US 101/Oakland Road interchange and
construction of a new US 101/Mabury Road interchange. Unlike most Area Development Policies that
base their fees on the number of residential units or square footages built, the fee for the US
101/Oakland/ Mabury TDP is based on the number of PM peak hour vehicular trips that would be added
to the US 101/Oakland Road interchange (including the Oakland Road/Commercial Street intersection).
Since the proposed project would send some PM peak hour vehicle trips through the US 101/Oakland
Road interchange, the project would be required to pay a fair share contribution toward the planned
interchange improvements. The current TDP traffic impact fee is $34,913 per each new PM peak hour
vehicle trip that would be added to the US 101/Oakland Road interchange. The project would add 26 new
trips to the interchange during the PM peak hour of traffic.
Estimated US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP Impact Fee: $34,913 x 24 net PM peak hour trips = $837,912

Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
Traffic volumes on the study freeway segments with the project were estimated by adding project trips to
the freeway segment volumes obtained from the 2012 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results of the
freeway segment analysis show that the project would not cause significant increases in traffic volumes
(one percent or more of freeway capacity) on any of the study freeway segments currently operating at
LOS F, and none of the study freeway segments currently operating at LOS E or better would worsen to
LOS F as a result of the project (see Table 11). Therefore, based on CMP freeway impact criteria, none of
the study freeway segments would be significantly impacted by the project.

Comparison Between the 2010 and 2014 Cannery Park Projects
The original 2010 Cannery Park project was approved but was never built. Since that time, the project
has changed. For this reason, the results of the 2010 traffic study prepared for the original Cannery Park
project were compared against the results of the current 2014 traffic study to determine whether changes
to the project would result in different conclusions with regard to significant traffic impacts.
The results of the current traffic study are relatively consistent with the results of the 2010 traffic study.
Both studies show a significant project impact requiring payment of the Protected Intersection Traffic
Impact Fee, both studies require participation in the US 101/Oakland/Mabury TDP Traffic Impact Fee
Program, and both studies show no significant freeway impacts. Where the two traffic studies differ is that
the 2010 study showed significant project impacts at four Protected Intersections, while the current 2014
study shows significant project impacts at two Protected Intersections: North First Street/Taylor Street and
North Thirteenth Street/Hedding Street. The 2010 traffic study also showed significant traffic impacts at
the Protected Intersections of North Tenth Street/Hedding Street and North Eleventh Street/Taylor Street.
The main reason for the discrepancy is that the background roadway network assumptions differ between
the two studies. The 2010 study assumed that North Tenth and North Eleventh Streets were to be
converted from one-way streets to two-way streets between Julian Street and Hedding Street. However,
the City reduced the number of travel lanes on both one-way streets from three lanes to two lanes and
added buffered bike lanes in lieu of the couplet conversion project. The couplet conversion is no longer
being considered by the City of San Jose.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project, including:
       Intersection operations analysis – vehicle queuing and storage at selected intersections
       Freeway off-ramp operations analysis – vehicle queuing and storage at selected freeway ramps
       Freeway on-ramp meter analysis
       Unsignalized intersection analysis – North Ninth Street and Taylor Street
       Potential project impacts to transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities
       Site access, circulation and parking
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this
chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by
the traffic engineering community.

Intersection Operations Analysis
The analysis of intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of traffic operations for
intersections where the project would add left turns. The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing
for high demand left-turn movements at intersections. Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson
probability distribution, which estimates the probability of “n” vehicles for a vehicle movement using the
following formula:
                           P (x=n) =        n e – (
                                               n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of “n” vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Average # of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hr per lane/signal cycles per hr)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned storage
capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-turn storage
requirements at signalized intersections. The 95th percentile queue length value indicates that during the
peak hour, a queue of this length or less would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue
length larger than the 95th percentile queue would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3
cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a 60-second cycle length). Thus, left-turn storage pocket
designs based on the 95th percentile queue length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded
only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile queue length is also known as the “design queue length.”
The vehicle queue estimates and a tabulated summary of the findings are provided in Tables 12 and 13.

North First Street and Hedding Street
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the North First Street/Hedding Street intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity
during the PM peak hour of traffic, and that this condition would continue to occur under existing plus
project, background, and background plus project conditions. The southbound left-turn pocket provides
about 175 feet of vehicle storage for a capacity of up to approximately 7 vehicles. The 95th percentile
vehicle queue currently is 250 feet during the PM peak hour. A maximum queue length of 350 feet would
occur during the PM peak hour under background conditions as a result of approved projects in the area.
The project would increase the maximum vehicle queue by one vehicle length (25 feet). Extending the
southbound left-turn pocket would require removal of the existing raised median adjacent to the existing

                                                                                                                            57 | Page

LRT line, including some trees, and re-striping. Since the existing LRT line runs through this intersection,
and because improvements to this intersection would require significant modifications that could disrupt
LRT service and would require removal of some large trees, lengthening the southbound left-turn pocket
is not a feasible option.

North First Street and Taylor Street
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Protected Intersection of North First Street/Taylor Street currently are equal to the existing vehicle
storage capacity during the PM peak hour of traffic. However, the maximum vehicle queues would exceed
the existing vehicle storage capacity during the PM peak hour of traffic under background and
background plus project conditions. The southbound left-turn pocket provides about 250 feet of vehicle
storage for a capacity of up to approximately 10 vehicles. The 95th percentile vehicle queue currently is
250 feet during the PM peak hour. A maximum queue length of 350 feet would occur during the PM peak
hour under background conditions as a result of approved projects in the area. The project would not
increase the vehicle queue length. Extending the southbound left-turn pocket would require re-striping
only. However, since the existing LRT line runs down the middle of North First Street, and because this
intersection is on the City’s Protected Intersection list, the City most likely would not request that the
project make any changes to this intersection.

Old Oakland Road and US 101 Northbound Ramps
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the northbound left-turn pocket at
the North First Street/Hedding Street intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity
during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic, and that this condition would continue to occur under
existing plus project, background, and background plus project conditions. The northbound left-turn
pocket provides about 150 feet of vehicle storage for a capacity of up to approximately 6 vehicles. A
maximum vehicle queue length of 850 feet would occur during the AM peak hour under background
conditions as a result of approved projects in the area, and the project would increase the vehicle queue
by one vehicle length (25 feet). The addition of a second northbound left-turn lane on Old Oakland Road
is proposed as mitigation by the San Jose Flea Market project. This improvement would be funded and
implemented either with approval of the Flea Market project or via the approved US 101/Oakland/Mabury
Transportation Development Policy (TDP).

Freeway Off-Ramp Operations Analysis
Vehicle queuing on the US 101, I-880 and SR 87 freeway off-ramps were analyzed for project conditions
using the Poisson probability distribution. Only the turning-movements on the off-ramps where the project
would add more than 5 peak hour vehicle trips were evaluated. Table 14 shows that the existing vehicle
storage on the US 101, I-880 and SR 87 freeway off-ramps that were analyzed would be adequate to
serve the estimated maximum vehicle queues that would occur during the AM and PM peak hours under
all traffic scenarios.

Freeway On-Ramp Meter Analysis
An analysis of metered freeway on-ramps providing access to SR 87, US 101 and I-880 from the project
site was performed to identify the effect of the addition of project traffic on the vehicle queues at the
metered on-ramps during the AM and PM peak commute periods. Note that the metering light on the I-
880 northbound diagonal on-ramp from northbound North First Street is turned off, so this on-ramp was
not evaluated. The metered freeway on-ramps that currently are operating and were evaluated during
either the AM or PM peak hour are listed below:

       US 101 northbound on-ramp from Oakland Road – AM peak hour
       SR 87 northbound on-ramp from Taylor Street – AM peak hour
       SR 87 southbound on-ramp from Taylor Street – PM peak hour
       I-880 southbound loop on-ramp from northbound North First Street – PM peak hour

    Assumes 25 feet per vehicle queued.




The existing maximum vehicle queue at each metered on-ramp was measured in the field during the AM
or PM peak commute period. A ratio between the existing ramp volumes and the approved and project
trips was used to estimate the number of vehicles that would be added to the existing queue under
background and background plus project conditions.
The project would add 12 or fewer peak hour vehicle trips to the metered freeway on-ramps that were
analyzed. Based on the results of the freeway on-ramp meter analysis, it can be concluded that the

addition of project trips to the metered ramps in the study area would have very little effect on the vehicle
queues at the on-ramps when compared to background conditions. Table 15 shows the maximum vehicle

/d/ The maximum vehicle queue in the HOV lane was 11 vehicles.



While the metered on-ramps that were evaluated currently provide adequate storage for the vehicle
queues that occur and would continue to occur with the project, the number of queued vehicles on the SR
87 southbound on-ramp from Taylor Street during the PM peak hour is partially controlled by the
signalized interchange. More specifically, the green time assigned to the westbound left-turn movement
controls how many cars are added to the on-ramp queue. This on-ramp is discussed in more detail below.

SR 87 Southbound On-Ramp from Taylor Street
This on-ramp currently consists of two mixed-flow lanes and one HOV lane. The mixed flow lanes are
approximately 800 feet long, and the HOV lane is about 600 feet in length. During the PM peak hour, the
longest vehicle queue observed in the mixed-flow lanes was approximately 750 feet per lane. The
maximum vehicle queue observed in the HOV lane was approximately 300 feet in length. The vehicle
queues at the metering light did not quite extend back to Taylor Street because the green time assigned
to the westbound left-turn movement of the Taylor Street interchange limits the number of vehicles added
to the queue. However, because of the limited green time, not all of the queued vehicles in the westbound
left-turn pocket clear the intersection in one signal cycle.

Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
Unlike signalized intersections, which typically represent constraint points for the roadway network,
unsignalized intersections rarely limit the potential capacity of a roadway. The determination of
appropriate improvements to unsignalized intersections typically includes a qualitative and quantitative
analysis of movement delay, vehicle queuing, and intersection safety. For this reason, improvements to
unsignalized intersections are frequently determined on the basis of professional judgment. The City of
San Jose has not established significance thresholds for unsignalized intersections.
An operational analysis was conducted for the unsignalized intersection of North Ninth Street and Taylor
Street in order to determine the vehicle queuing and delay that would occur at this location with the
addition of project-generated traffic. A signal warrant is another tool for measuring the operations of an
unsignalized intersection. The need for signalization of unsignalized intersections is assessed based on
the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices

                                                                                                                60 | Page

(MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4). This method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but
simply provides an indication whether vehicular peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to
justify installation of a traffic signal. Intersections that meet the peak hour warrant are subject to further
analysis before determining that a traffic signal is necessary. Further analysis may include additional
signal warrants and/or unsignalized level of service analysis. Other types of traffic control devices,
signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing field conditions.

Vehicle Queuing and Delay
The northbound and southbound stop-controlled movements at the North Ninth Street and Taylor Street
intersection currently experience long vehicle delays due to the eastbound and westbound peak hour
traffic volumes on Taylor Street. The heavy AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes on Taylor Street make
it difficult for vehicles on the minor street approaches to proceed through the intersection or to turn left
onto Taylor Street during both peak commute periods. The addition of traffic generated by approved
projects in the area, as well as traffic generated by the Cannery Park Village project, would increase the
vehicle delays and queuing for the northbound and southbound movements at this intersection.
The results of the unsignalized intersection analysis show that the traffic on North Ninth Street and the
project driveway at Taylor Street currently experience LOS D operation and would worsen to LOS F
under both background and background plus project conditions due to increases in vehicle delay. While
the project would add some trips to the minor street approaches of the intersection, the increase would
not be significant. The future level of service on the minor approaches of the intersection would be due
mostly to the increased traffic on Taylor Street as a result of other approved projects in the area that are
assumed under background conditions. The future traffic increase on Taylor Street will reduce the
number of gaps in traffic and make it more difficult for exiting vehicles to merge onto Taylor Street.
Left turns or through movements from a minor street approach are more challenging than right turns
because they require sufficient gaps in traffic in both directions of travel. If there are insufficient gaps for
drivers, then long vehicle delays will occur. At some point, the delays become too great and drivers begin
to seek alternate routes. The most obvious option for drivers on the northbound and southbound
approaches of the North Ninth Street/Taylor Street intersection is to turn right instead and utilize
alternative roadways. Since the project proposes a driveway on North Tenth Street that would connect
directly to the parking garage, most of the future residents would utilize this driveway and avoid the North
Ninth Street/Taylor Street intersection altogether. For this reason, very few project trips were assigned to
the outbound (southbound) left-turn and through movements at the North Ninth Street/Taylor Street
intersection, which are the turning movements that experience the greatest delay at this intersection.
Most of the project trips assigned to the southbound left-turn movement are associated with the retail
component of the project, since retail customers would park in the surface lot located outside of the
residential parking garage.
It is important to note that the excessive vehicle delays for the minor street stop-controlled approaches
would only occur during the peak commute periods and would not present a problem the remainder of the
day. Note also that vehicle delay and queuing issues for stop-controlled movements at unsignalized
intersections are considered operational issues only and are not considered a significant project impact.

Gap Analysis on Taylor Street
Counts were conducted of the gaps in traffic on eastbound and westbound Taylor Street between North
Eighth and North Tenth Streets. Based on field observations of vehicle speeds and driver behavior, the
minimum two-way gap time required for a vehicle to turn left out of either the Taylor Street driveway or
from North Ninth Street is approximately 5 seconds, although some drivers required less time.
During the AM peak one-hour period, 60 two-way gaps of 5 seconds or more were counted. The majority
of gaps that were counted during the AM peak hour were between 5 and 10 seconds long. The average
recorded two-way gap time was approximately 10.5 seconds. Based on the number and length of gaps
observed, it is estimated that approximately 60 vehicles could turn left or go straight out of the Taylor
Street driveway during the AM peak one-hour period of traffic. Since it is estimated that only 8 AM peak
hour vehicles would go straight out of the driveway onto southbound North Ninth Street and only 1 AM

                                                                                              61 | Page

peak hour vehicle would turn left out of the driveway onto eastbound Taylor Street, a sufficient number of
gaps would exist and no significant on-site queuing issues are expected to occur during the AM peak
one-hour period of the day.
During the PM peak one-hour period, 50 two-way gaps of 5 seconds or more were counted. The majority
of gaps that were counted during the PM peak hour were between 5 and 10 seconds long. The average
recorded two-way gap time was approximately 8.5 seconds. Based on the number and length of gaps
observed, it is estimated that approximately 50 vehicles could turn left or go straight out of the Taylor
Street driveway during the PM peak one-hour period of traffic. Since it is estimated that only 7 PM peak
hour vehicles would go straight out of the driveway onto southbound North Ninth Street and only 2 PM
peak hour vehicles would turn left out of the driveway onto eastbound Taylor Street, a sufficient number
of gaps would exist and no significant on-site queuing issues are expected to occur during the PM peak
one-hour period of the day.
Some minor on-site vehicle queuing is to be expected due to a combination of the inherent
unpredictability of vehicle arrivals at driveways and the random occurrence of gaps in traffic that exists on
Taylor Street. Based on the total number of vehicles expected to exit the Taylor Street driveway during
the AM and PM peak hours of traffic (102 AM trips and 59 PM trips), the maximum outbound vehicle
queue that would occur on-site is estimated to be about 3 vehicles in length (during the AM peak hour).
Only minor on-site vehicle queuing is expected to occur because the majority of vehicles exiting the site
would turn right onto westbound Taylor Street, and this right-turn movement would have very little delay.
Since the driveway throat would provide adequate on-site storage for 2 vehicles, 3 on-site parking spaces
(including one handicapped space) would be blocked when the maximum outbound vehicle queue is
present. However, a maximum queue length of 3 vehicles would only occur occasionally during the AM
peak hour and would not occur the remainder of the day, including during the PM peak hour when an
estimated maximum queue length of just 2 vehicles would occur.
Due to the close proximity of the project driveway to the North Tenth Street/Taylor Street singalized
intersection, the vehicle queuing that occurs along Taylor Street could prevent vehicles from turning left
out of the project driveway. However, based on field observations, vehicles on Taylor Street typically
leave a gap at the project driveway location. This gap allows vehicles to enter and exit the project site
driveway even when the vehicle queues on Taylor Street extend past the driveway.

Signal Warrant
A peak hour signal warrant check (MUTCD 2010 Edition, Part 4, Warrant 3) was performed for the
unsignalized study intersection of North Ninth Street and Taylor Street to determine whether signalization
would be justified on the basis of project peak hour traffic volumes. The analysis revealed that the peak
hour volume warrant would not be satisfied at the unsignalized intersection during either the AM peak
hour or PM peak hour based on background plus project traffic volumes. The signal warrant worksheets
are included in Appendix E.

Transit Services
As described in Chapter 2, local routes 12, 61 and 62 stop adjacent to the project site on North Tenth
Street. Routes 61 and 62 serve the Civic Center LRT station, which is located approximately ¾ of a mile
from the project site. For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that some residents would utilize the
transit services in the area. Applying a 9 percent transit mode share, which corresponds to the maximum
allowed transit reduction per VTA guidelines, equates to approximately 18 new transit riders during the
AM peak hour and about 22 new transit riders during the PM peak hour. It is estimated that these new
riders could be accommodated by the current available capacities of the LRT, commuter rail, and bus
services in the study area.
The City’s General Plan identifies the transit commute mode split target as “at least 20 percent” for the
year 2040. This calculates to at least 40 new transit riders during the peak hours of traffic. Due to the
distance between the project site and LRT and passenger train services, this level of transit mode share
is probably not attainable without additional transit-related services. The following measures would help to
encourage more residents of the project to utilize transit services in the area:

                                                                                           62 | Page

       Provide direct shuttle service between the project site and the Civic Center LRT station.
       Provide direct shuttle service to and from the San Jose Diridon station (Caltrain, ACE, Amtrak).
       Supply on-site information regarding transit services in the area and shuttle service.
       Provide on-site transit ticket sales.
       Work with the VTA to reduce the headways of local bus routes that serve the site. Routes 61 and
        62 currently operate with 30-minute headways.
       Upgrade the bus stop on N. Tenth Street to include a bus shelter with a bench and lighting.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities consist mostly of sidewalks along the streets in the immediate vicinity of the project
site. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads are located at all of the signalized intersections in the study
area. Overall, the network of sidewalks and crosswalks would provide good connectivity and provide
pedestrians with safe routes between the project site and the surrounding land uses and transit services
in the area. The City’s General Plan identifies the walk commute mode split target as 15 percent or more
for the year 2040.

Schools
There are four schools (two public and two private) located within an approximately one-half mile radius
of the project site: 1) Grant Elementary School, located on North Tenth Street, is approximately one-
quarter mile southeast of the project site; 2) Peter Burnett Middle School, located on North Second Street,
is about one-half mile west of the project site; 3) Montessori Academy, located on North First Street about
one-half mile west of the project site, provides a private preschool through kindergarten learning program;
and 4) Lotus Preschool is a private preschool located at the San Jose Buddhist Church Bestuin on North
Fifth Street between Taylor and Jackson Streets, and is less than one-half mile walk from the project site.
The project should consider working closely with these schools to implement a Safe Routes to Schools
program. Safe Routes to Schools is designed to decrease traffic and pollution and increase the health of
children and the community as a whole. The program promotes walking and biking to school through
education and incentives. The program also addresses the safety concerns of parents by encouraging
greater enforcement of traffic laws, educating the public, and exploring ways to create safer streets. A
comprehensive Safe Routes to Schools program should identify a focused area surrounding the schools,
provide a map with the routes that children can take to school, and recommend improvements to routes if
necessary. It should address such pedestrian safety issues as dangerous intersections and missing or
ineffective crosswalks and sidewalks.

Parks
Two sizeable public parks are located within approximately one-half mile walking distance of the project
site: Bernal Park and Backesto Park. Bernal Park is located west of the project site and is bordered by
Hedding Street on the north, North Eighth Street on the east, Mission Street on the south, and North
Seventh Street on the west. Backesto Park is located southeast of the project site and is bordered by
Jackson Street on the north, North Fifteenth Street on the east, Empire Street on the south, and North
Thirteenth Street on the west. Also, the Guadalupe River Park trail system is situated approximately one
mile west of the project site, and offers a continuous paved trail for pedestrians and bicyclists that is
separated from motor vehicle traffic. Access to the Guadalupe River Park trail is provided via Hedding
and Taylor Streets. Residents of the proposed residential development could potentially utilize these
public parks for recreational purposes. The existing roadway facilities would be adequate for residents to
walk and/or bike to and from these parks. In addition to the nearby existing parks, the project would
construct a new public park located on the north end of the project site.

Bicycle Facilities
Striped bicycle lanes exist on North Tenth Street adjacent to the project site, as well as numerous other
roadways in the vicinity of the site. The project site is located approximately ¾ of a mile from the Civic
Center LRT station, and bicycles are permitted on LRT trains.


                                                                                           63 | Page

Although Taylor Street provides a direct connection to the Guadalupe River trail system, Taylor Street
does not contain bike lanes. However, Hedding Street has bike lanes and also provides a connection to
the trail system. The Guadalupe River trail system is an 11-mile paved trail that runs through the City of
San Jose along the Guadalupe River and is separated from motor vehicle traffic. The Guadalupe River
trail is a continuous Class I bikeway from Curtner Avenue in the south to SR 237 in the north.
The City’s General Plan identifies the bicycle commute mode split target as 15 percent (or more) for the
year 2040. This calculates to approximately 30 new bicycle trips during the AM peak hour and about 36
new bicycle trips during the PM peak hour. Based on the extensive network of bike lanes in the study
area, this level of bicycle mode share is a reasonable goal for the project.

Site Access and Circulation
The site access and circulation evaluation is based on the January 15, 2015 site plan prepared by KTGY
Group, Inc. (see Figure 15). On-site vehicular circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally
accepted traffic engineering standards.

Site Access
Based on the site plan, project-generated traffic (residential and retail trips) would enter the site via the
north leg of the North Ninth Street/Taylor Street intersection (hereafter referred to as the Taylor Street
driveway) and the project driveway on North Tenth Street. Approximately 60 percent of project traffic
would utilize the Taylor Street driveway, and the remaining 40 percent would use the North Tenth Street
driveway. The Taylor Street driveway measures 26 feet wide (measured at the throat) and would provide
access to the surface parking and multi-level parking garage. The North Tenth Street driveway throat
measures 22 feet wide and would provide direct access to the parking garage for residents only.
The project driveways must provide adequate vehicle access and storage space to avoid backups onto
the sidewalk and street. The Taylor Street driveway throat length (distance between Taylor Street and the
on-site parking spaces) is shown to be 50 feet. The North Tenth Street driveway throat length is shown to
be approximately 150 feet. The City typically requires a minimum distance of 50 feet, measured from the
face of curb, in order to provide adequate stacking space for at least two inbound vehicles. Thus,
adequate stacking space for inbound vehicles would be provided at both project driveways.
Taylor Street Driveway
The project-generated trips that are estimated to occur at the Taylor Street driveway are 26 inbound trips
and 102 outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 92 inbound trips and 58 outbound trips during the
PM peak hour. As previously discussed, the Taylor Street driveway currently experiences long vehicle
delays due to the eastbound and westbound peak hour traffic volumes on Taylor Street. The heavy AM
and PM peak hour traffic volumes on Taylor Street make it difficult for vehicles exiting the site to proceed
through the intersection or to turn left onto eastbound Taylor Street during both peak commute periods.
The addition of traffic generated by approved projects in the area, as well as traffic generated by the
Cannery Park Village project, would increase the vehicle delays and queuing for vehicles exiting the
Taylor Street driveway. However, residents would have the option to use the North Tenth Street driveway
to exit the site if delays become excessive.

North Tenth Street Driveway
The project-generated trips that are estimated to occur at the North Tenth Street driveway are 17 inbound
trips and 61 outbound trips during the AM peak hour, and 66 inbound trips and 31 outbound trips during
the PM peak hour. Since only right turns would be possible into and out of this project driveway, and
because the number of trips utilizing this driveway is estimated to be small, no operational issues are
expected to occur at the North Tenth Street driveway. In addition, since this driveway would be located
more than 500 feet north of Taylor Street, southbound vehicle queues at the North Tenth Street/Taylor
Street intersection would not interfere with driveway operations.

Sight Distance
Based on the site plan provided, the project driveways would be free and clear of obstructions, thereby
ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and vehicles traveling on Taylor Street
and North Tenth Street. The site plan shows a 15-foot building setback along both streets.
Providing the appropriate sight distance reduces the likelihood of a collision at a driveway or intersection,
and provides drivers with the ability to exit a driveway or locate sufficient gaps in traffic. Sight distance
generally should be provided in accordance with Caltrans standards. The minimum acceptable sight
distance is often considered the Caltrans stopping sight distance. Sight distance requirements vary
depending on the roadway speeds. For driveways on Taylor Street, which has a posted speed limit of 25
mph, the Caltrans stopping sight distance is 200 feet (based on a design speed of 30 mph). Thus, a driver
must be able to see 200 feet down Taylor Street in order to stop and avoid a collision. For driveways on
North Tenth Street, which has a posted speed limit of 30 mph, the Caltrans stopping sight distance is 250
feet (based on a design speed of 35 mph). Thus, a driver must be able to see 250 feet down North Tenth
Street in order to avoid a collision.
Based on the project site plan, it can be concluded that the project driveways would meet the Caltrans
sight distance standard.

On-Site Circulation
On-site vehicular circulation was reviewed for the project in accordance with generally accepted traffic
engineering standards. The main drive aisle would provide access to all of the surface parking, as well as
the parking garage. The northernmost end of the main drive aisle has two parking stalls. These parking
stalls would be easy to enter but difficult to exit. Drivers may have difficulty backing out of these spaces,
resulting in a multi-point maneuver. It is recommended that these spaces be removed and the area left
open, and widened if possible, to allow vehicles to use the end of the aisle to turn around.
The site plan exhibits good circulation within the parking garage with only one dead-end drive aisle on the
first parking level and no dead-end drive aisles on the other four parking levels.
The City’s standard width for two-way drive aisles is 26 feet wide where 90-degree parking is provided.
This allows sufficient room for vehicles to back out of parking spaces. According to the site plan, the drive
aisles on all levels of the parking garage measure 26 feet wide. Adequate access to all parking stalls
would be provided. However, we recommend removing the two parking stalls located at the northernmost
end of the main drive aisle.
Overall vehicular circulation on all levels of the parking garage would be adequate to serve the project.

Truck Access and Circulation
The site plan shows two on-site loading areas with access provided via the main drive aisle. Both loading
areas measure 20 feet wide by approximately 50 feet long and would be accessible by large trucks (up to
type SU 30). Garbage collection would occur at these locations. Moving vans and large delivery vehicles
would utilize these designated loading areas as well.
Emergency vehicle access to all areas the project site is provided via North Tenth Street on the east,
Taylor Street on the south, the Taylor Street project driveway/drive aisle on the west, and an access
easement on the north. These access points would create a continuous loop around the site for
emergency vehicles.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Access and Circulation
The project is proposing to utilize the existing sidewalks surrounding the site. The site plan shows that
multiple pedestrian connections would be provided on Tenth Street and one on Taylor Street. The site
plan also shows bulb-outs on all four corners of the North Tenth Street/Taylor Street intersection. Bulb-
outs are beneficial to pedestrians because they help to slow down vehicles, make intersections and
pedestrians more visible to drivers, and reduce pedestrian crossing distances. If bulb-outs are added, the
design will need to incorporate ADA compliant curb ramps, including truncated domes. Truncated domes

                                                                                           66 | Page

are the standard design requirement for detectable warnings which enable people with visual disabilities
to determine the boundary between the sidewalk or and the street.

Parking
The project proposes 403 apartment units, including 47 studio, 231 one-bedroom, and 125 two-bedroom
units. The project also includes 5,000 s.f. of retail space. The City of San Jose’s off-street parking
requirements for multiple dwellings with all open parking are as follows: 1.25 parking spaces for studio
and one-bedroom units, and 1.7 parking spaces for two-bedroom units. The City’s off-street parking
requirement for general retail uses is 1 parking space per 200 s.f. of floor area. Based on the City’s
parking requirements, the project should provide a total of 585 parking spaces.
The project proposes to provide a total of 755 parking spaces: 178 surface spaces and 577 spaces in a
five-story parking garage. Thus, the project would provide 170 more parking spaces than what is required
by the parking code.

Parking Stall Dimensions
According to the site plan, all of the 90-degree parking stalls are shown to be 9 feet wide by 18 feet deep.
This meets the City of San Jose off-street parking design standard for full-size car spaces. Van
accessibility is provided at all handicapped stall locations.

Bicycle and Motorcycle Parking
The project proposes 101 bicycle parking spaces and 101 motorcycle parking spaces. This meets the
City of San Jose bicycle and motorcycle parking requirements of 1 parking space per 4 residential units.
Bicycle access to the parking garage would be provided via a pedestrian connection on Taylor Street.
The existing buffered bike lane along North Tenth Street will serve the project well.
