Subject:        Traffic Operations Analysis for a Proposed Residential and Commercial
                Development at 26601 Mission Boulevard in Hayward, California

Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc. has completed a traffic impact analysis for the proposed
residential and commercial development project located at 26601 Mission Boulevard in Hayward,
California. The project site is currently occupied by a few mostly vacated retail stores. The project
proposes to demolish all existing buildings on site and construct 74 attached residential units (35
townhomes and 39 apartments) and a 1,500 square feet coffee shop. Access to the site would be
provided via one driveway on Mission Boulevard and one driveway on Sorenson Road. Access to
the coffee shop would be primarily through the driveway on Sorenson Road.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the City of Hayward. The traffic study includes an analysis of AM and PM
peak hour traffic conditions at three signalized intersections and an evaluation of the traffic
operations at the two project’s driveways. The study intersections are listed below and shown on
Figure 1.
Study Intersections (Signalized)
      1. Mission Boulevard and Harder Road
      2. Mission Boulevard and Sorenson Road
      3. Mission Boulevard and Tennyson Road
Project Site Driveways (Unsignalized)
         Mission Boulevard and Project Driveway
         Sorenson Road and Project Driveway

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for both the weekday AM and PM peak
hours of adjacent street traffic. The morning peak hour is expected to occur between 7:00 AM and
9:00 AM and the afternoon peak hour is expected to occur between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM on a
typical weekday. These are the peak commute hours during which most traffic congestion occurs
on the roadways.

Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:

   Scenario 1: Existing Conditions. Existing conditions are represented by existing peak hour
               traffic volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were
               obtained from recent traffic counts conducted in October 2016 (see Appendix A).

   Scenario 2: Existing plus Project Conditions. Project-generated traffic volumes were added to
               existing traffic volumes to estimate existing plus project conditions. Existing plus
               project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions to determine the
               effects the project would have on the existing roadway network.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario
described above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and
the applicable level of service standards.
Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts and field observations. The
following data were collected from these sources:

      existing traffic volumes
      existing lane configurations
      signal timing and phasing (for signalized intersections)
      on-street parking occupancies
      existing bicycle facilities
      existing transit service
Signalized Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of
Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow
conditions with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The City of
Hayward utilizes SYNCHRO software and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 methodology
to evaluate intersection operations. The HCM methodology evaluates intersection operations on the
basis of average delay for all vehicles at the intersection. This average delay can then be correlated
to a level of service. The City of Hayward’s level of service standard for all signalized study
intersections is LOS E.
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. According to City of Hayward
standards, a project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a
signalized intersection if for either peak hour:
       1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better
          under no project conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions, or
       2. If the intersection is already operating at an unacceptable LOS F under no project
          conditions, the addition of the project causes the intersection average control delay to
          increase by more than 5 seconds per vehicle.
A significant impact at a signalized intersection is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection levels of service to an acceptable LOS or restore
the intersection to operating levels that are equal to or better than no project conditions.



                                                                                         Page | 3

Unsignalized Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. According to City of Hayward
standards, a project would create a potentially significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at an
unsignalized intersection if for either peak hour:
   1. An intersection that operates at an unacceptable LOS F under no project conditions
      experiences an average control delay increase of 5 seconds or more when project traffic is
      added.

Existing Conditions
Existing Roadway Network
Access to the project site is provided via Mission Boulevard (State Route 238) and Sorenson Road.
Other roadways in the project vicinity include Harder Road and Tennyson Road. These roadway
characteristics of these facilities are described below.
Mission Boulevard (State Route 238) is a four- to six-lane, north-south, major arterial that extends
from I-238 in Hayward to I-880 in south Fremont. The section of Mission Boulevard within the study
area varies between four and six lanes. At the site, Mission Boulevard has a landscaped median
and provides direct southbound right-in/right-out access to the site.
Sorenson Road is a two-lane, east-west, residential local street that runs between Mission
Boulevard in the east to Luvena Drive in the west. The project site has one full-access driveway on
Sorenson Road.
Harder Road is a four-lane, east-west, minor arterial that extends from Old Hillary Road in the east
to Jackson Street in the west. It provides direct access to I-880 and State Route 92.
Tennyson Road is a four-lane, east-west, major arterial that extends from Industrial Boulevard in
the east to Mission Boulevard in the west. It provides direct access to I-880.
Existing Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
There are Class I and II bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the site. Harder Road has Class II bike
lanes on both sides from Westview Way to Bishop Avenue, where it becomes Santa Clara Street.
Tennyson Road also includes Class II bike lanes on both sides in its entirety except for a small
section between Mission Boulevard and East 12th Street in the project vicinity and a short segment
over the I-880/Tennyson Road interchange. There are also Class II bike lanes along Whitman
Street, north of Tennyson Road. There are no existing bike facilities on Mission Boulevard or
Sorenson Road. According to the 2007 Hayward Bicycle Master Plan, a future multi-use path
(called the Station Area Trail) that would run parallel to the BART tracks between Harder Road and
the South Hayward BART station is planned as part of the South Hayward BART Concept Design
Plan. A bicycle-pedestrian bridge over Tennyson Road would also be built as part of the Station
Area Trail project, providing direct bicycle and pedestrian access to the South Hayward BART
station. The existing bike facilities are shown on Figure 2.
Pedestrian facilities in the study area consist of sidewalks along all surrounding streets. Most of the
signalized study intersections have crosswalks. The intersection at the Mission Boulevard and
Sorenson Road Avenue has crosswalks on the west and south legs only. There is a pedestrian
overpass that spans over the BART and Union Pacific railroad tracks, connecting Sorenson Road
and Whitman Street (hereby referred to as the Sorenson Road Pedestrian Bridge).

Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by Alameda-Contra Costa (AC) Transit and
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The existing transit lines are shown on Figure 3. The four AC
Transit bus lines in the project vicinity are: 22, 99, 801 and 37, which are described below.
Line 22 operates on Mission Boulevard in the project vicinity. It runs a loop service connecting
Hayward and South Hayward BART stations via Mission Boulevard, Tennyson Road., Hesperian
Boulevard, Chabot College, Southland Mall, W. Winton Avenue, and D Street with 30-minute
headways during both commute and midday hours between 5:45 AM and 10:45 PM. Line 22 also
provides weekend service. Bus stops are located directly adjacent to the project site at the Mission
Boulevard/Sorenson Road intersection.
Line 99 connects the Hayward and Fremont BART stations via Mission Boulevard primarily, with
20-minute headways between approximately 5:00 AM and 12:00 AM on weekdays. Line 99 also
provides weekend service. The bus stop closest to the project site is at the Mission
Boulevard/Sorenson Road intersection.
Line 801 provides all-night service between the Downtown Oakland and the Fremont BART
stations via Mission Boulevard every hour between approximately 11:40 PM and 4:40 AM on
weekdays. Line 801 also provides weekend service. The bus stop closest to the project site is at the
Mission Boulevard/Sorenson Road intersection.
Line 37 provides loop service between the Hayward and South Hayward BART stations and
operates along Whitman Street and Tennyson Road in the vicinity of the project site with 60-minute
headways between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM. The bus stop closest to the project site is at the Whitman
Street/Fruitwood Way intersection adjacent to the western approach of the Sorenson Road
Pedestrian Bridge.
BART: The South Hayward Bart Station is located approximately 1.0 mile south of the project site.
BART connects San Francisco with cities in the East Bay and suburbs in northern San Mateo
County. The South Hayward BART Station is served by the BART Fremont-Richmond and the
Fremont–Daly City lines. BART provides service from 4:00 AM to 12:00 AM on weekdays with
headways between 15 and 20 minutes on the Fremont-Richmond Line and 15-minute headways on
the Fremont–Daly City line from approximately 5:00 AM to 6:00 PM on weekdays.
Existing Intersection Lane Configurations and Traffic Volumes
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the
field. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from peak hour counts collected on October 12 th, 2016.
Because there was a road closure due to construction on the east leg at the intersection of Mission
Boulevard/Tennyson Road the time when traffic counts were collected, westbound turning
movement counts collected on March 15, 2016 before the east leg road closure were obtained from
City staff and applied in this study. The existing peak-hour intersection volumes are shown in Figure
4. Intersection turning-movement counts conducted for this analysis are presented in Appendix A.
Existing Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of Hayward standards. The results of the
intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 1.
The results of the analysis show that all three signalized study intersections currently operate at an
acceptable level, LOS D or better, during both the AM and PM peak hours. The intersection levels
of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and
to confirm the accuracy of calculated intersection levels of service. The purpose of this effort was
(1) to identify any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of service, and (2)
to identify any locations where the level of service analysis does not accurately reflect existing
traffic conditions.
Overall, the study intersections operate adequately during the weekday AM and PM peak hours,
and the level of service analysis appears to accurately reflect actual existing traffic conditions.
However, field observations revealed the following operational issues near the project site:
            Intersection at Mission Boulevard and Harder Road. During the PM peak hour
             approximately between 5:30 and 6:00 PM, it was observed that the northbound left turn
             green phase could not clear the entire queue, which means some vehicles experienced
             extended delays of more than one signal cycle. However, the left turn queue can be
             accommodated within the turn pocket without spilling over into the adjacent through lane.
            Intersection at Mission Boulevard and Tennyson Road. During the AM peak hour, the
             southbound queue on Mission Boulevard from the downstream intersection at Industrial
             Parkway occasionally extends to the intersection at Tennyson Road. However, the queue
             typically clears the intersection in one cycle.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear were estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3)
trip assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic traveling to and from
the site was estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, the
directions to and from the project trips would travel were estimated. In the project trip assignment,
the project trips were assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures are
described below.

                                                                                                                                    Page | 9

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that indicate the amount of traffic that can be
expected to be generated by common land uses. The standard trip generation rates can be applied
to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new development. The standard
trip generation rates are published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation
Manual.
The trips generated by the residential component of the proposed project were estimated using
rates for Apartments (Land Use 220) and Townhouse /Condominium (Land Use 230). The trips
generated by the coffee shop component of the proposed project were estimated using rates for
Coffee/Donut Shop Without Drive-Through Window (Land Use 936).
It is anticipated that the coffee shop component of the project would generate pass-by trips. Pass-
by trips are trips that would already be on the adjacent roadways (and are therefore already
counted in the existing traffic), but would turn into the site while passing by. Justification for applying
the pass-by trip reduction is founded on the observation that such traffic is not actually generated by
the proposed development, but is already part of the ambient traffic levels. A pass-by trip reduction
of 42 percent (based on pass-by rates used by other traffic studies conducted in the project vicinity)
was applied to the AM and PM peak hour trip generation for the coffee shop. Pass-by trips were
assumed to originate on Mission Boulevard and were assigned between the project site and the
intersection of Mission Boulevard/Sorenson Road. After applying pass-by trip reductions, the
proposed project would generate 1203 daily trips with 129 trips during the AM peak hour and 77
trips during the PM peak hour.
Traffic counts at the existing site driveways were conducted on October 12th, 2016 to quantify the
peak-hour trips generated by the existing uses (see Appendix A). Based on the driveway counts,
the existing uses on site generate 16 trips during the AM peak hour and 25 trips during the PM peak
hour. Subtracting the existing site driveway counts from the trip generated by the project, the site
would generate 998 net daily trips with 113 (46 inbound/67 outbound) net new trips during the AM
peak hour, and 52 (34 inbound/18 outbound) net new trips during the PM peak hour. The project
trip generation estimates are presented in Table 2.
Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the project was estimated based on existing travel patterns on the
surrounding roadway network, the locations of complementary land uses, and previous traffic
impact reports in the study area. The peak-hour trips generated by the project were assigned to the
roadway network in accordance with the project trip distribution patterns. Figure 5 also shows the
project trip distribution and assignment at each study intersection and the project driveways.

Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips, as shown in the above project trip assignment, were added to existing traffic volumes
to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes. The existing plus project traffic volumes are presented
on Figure 6.


Existing Plus Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are summarized in
Table 3. The results show that all signalized study intersections would continue to operate at LOS
D or better during the AM and PM peak hours under existing plus project conditions. Thus,
according to the City of Hayward level of service standard, the proposed project would not result in
any adverse LOS impacts to the intersections. The level of service calculation sheets are included
in the appendices.

Vehicle Queuing Analysis
A queuing analysis was conducted for the intersection turning movements where project trips would
be added. The intersection queuing analysis was conducted using SYNCHRO traffic analysis
software. Along with providing overall control delay and level of service for the intersection,
SYNCHRO provides total movement delay and 95th-percentile vehicle queues for each movement.
The results of the queuing analysis for each movement are shown in Table 4.

    Based on 95th percentile queue reported by Synchro software using the HCM methodology.



Mission Boulevard and Harder Road
The project adds trips to the northbound left-turn and the eastbound right-turn movements at the
intersection of Mission Boulevard and Harder Road. The analysis indicates that, with the addition of
project traffic, the 95th percentile vehicle queues could be accommodated by the existing storage
space during the AM and PM peak hours. Queue lengths estimated by SYNCHRO under existing
conditions generally reflect those observed in the field.
Mission Boulevard and Sorenson Road
The project adds trips to the northbound left-turn and the eastbound left-turn/right turn movements
at the intersection of Mission Boulevard and Sorenson Road. The analysis indicates that, with the
addition of project traffic, the 95th percentile vehicle queues could be accommodated by the existing

Mission Boulevard and Tennyson Road
The project adds trips to the eastbound left-turn and the southbound right turn movements at the
intersection of Mission Boulevard and Tennyson Road. The analysis indicates that, with the addition
of project traffic, the 95th percentile vehicle queues could be accommodated by the existing storage
space during the AM and PM peak hours. Queue lengths estimated by SYNCHRO under existing
conditions generally reflect those observed in the field.

Site Access and Circulation
The site access and circulation review is based on the site plans provided to Hexagon by the
project applicant dated April 2017. Figure 7 shows the overall project site plan and site driveway
traffic volumes. Figure 8 shows the garage parking and access layout of the apartment and coffee
shop components. The proposed project would have two access driveways, one on Mission
Boulevard and another on Sorenson Road. Access to the coffee shop would be via the project
driveway on Sorenson Road.
Site Access
The driveway on Mission Boulevard (referred to as the north driveway) is located near the north end
of the project site. It is a right-in/right-out driveway due to the existing median on Mission
Boulevard. The driveway will be stop-controlled and has one inbound and one outbound lane.
Under project conditions, it is anticipated that this driveway would serve approximately 9 AM peak
hour project trips (5 inbound and 4 outbound) and 23 PM peak hour project trips (21 inbound and 2
outbound). Based on the driveway counts, the four existing driveways on Mission Boulevard
serving this site have approximately 10 AM peak hour trips (9 inbound and 1 outbound) and 14 PM
peak hour trips (11 inbound and 3 outbound). Existing driveway turning movements are shown in
Appendix A.
The driveway on Sorenson Road (referred to as the south driveway) is located at approximately 150
feet west from the intersection of Mission Boulevard and Sorenson Road. The site plan shows the
driveway on Sorenson Road would be a full access driveway. It would also be stop-controlled and
has one inbound and one outbound lane. Under project conditions, it is anticipated that this
driveway would serve approximately 189 AM peak hour project trips (85 inbound and 104
outbound) and 80 PM peak hour project trips (38 inbound and 42 outbound). Based on the
driveway counts, the two existing driveways on Sorenson Road serving this site have approximately
6 AM peak hour trips (0 inbound and 6 outbound) and 11 PM peak hour trips (1 inbound and10
outbound).
The sight distance for traffic exiting the site at the driveway on Sorenson Road will be partially
obstructed due to the walls of the parking garage structure. Traffic exiting the site would have to pull
slowly out of the driveway in order to see traffic traveling westbound on Soronson Road. However,
since cars would just have turned at the intersection with Mission Boulevard, westbound traffic on
Soronson Road would be traveling at slow speeds. In addition, there should be ample gaps in the
westbound traffic flow on Sorensen Road for project traffic to exit since Sorensen Road traffic will
be “metered” due to the traffic signal at Mission Boulevard.
Because the north driveway on Mission Boulevard would only serve right-in/right-out traffic and
southbound U-turns are prohibited at the intersection of Mission Boulevard/Sorenson Road, it was
assumed that all project trips going to Harder Road and northbound Mission Boulevard would exit
from the south driveway on Sorenson Road and turn left at the intersection with Mission Boulevard.
It is estimated that there would be 104 and 42 left turning vehicles exiting from this driveway during
the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

According to the level of service and queuing calculations, the north driveway would operate at LOS
D (25.9 seconds delay) during the AM peak hour and LOS C (18.4 seconds delay) during the PM
peak hour with maximum 95th percentile queue of one vehicle during the peak hours. It has a throat
length of approximately 20 feet (one vehicle’s length) measured from the back of sidewalk, beyond
which it will block access to the adjacent perpendicular visitor parking spaces. Therefore, the
queue could be accommodated in the storage space provided.
The south driveway would operate at LOS B (11.1 seconds delay) during the AM peak hour and
LOS B (11.2 seconds delay) during the PM peak hour with maximum 95th percentile queue of one
vehicle during the peak hours. It has a throat length of approximately 20 feet measured from the
back of sidewalk, beyond which it will block access to the apartment’s garages.
Based on the queueing analysis shown in Table 4, the 95th percentile queue for the eastbound left
turn lane would be 142 feet. There is about 150 feet of storage on Sorenson Road between the
project driveway and Mission Boulevard. Therefore, the 95th percentile queue could be
accommodated in the storage space provided. However, the traffic operations at this locations
should be monitored and if it turns out that the eastbound queue on Sorenson Road frequently
exceeds the available storage and blocks the project driveway, a “Keep Clear” pavement marking
should be applied.
The corner sight distance at both project driveways was checked in the field and determined to be
adequate. The widths of the north and south site driveways are 26.5 feet and 26 feet, respectively.
Both site driveways meet the City of Hayward residential driveway design standards.
Site Circulation
The on-site circulation is provided primarily by three main drive aisles. Drive Aisle A connects to the
north driveway on Mission Boulevard and provides access to the garages of the townhome units
along the north side of the project. Drive Aisle B intersects with Drive Aisle A and runs in the middle
of the project site to provide access to the garages of the townhomes along both sides of the drive
aisle. Drive Aisle B also connects to Drive Aisle C, which leads to the south driveway on Sorenson
Road.
According to the site plan, a single-level parking garage would be built underneath the apartment
units. The parking garage has a standard 90-degree parking layout and follows a horseshoe
circulation pattern with two entrances leading to Drive Aisle C. Both parking garage entrances are
27 feet wide and provide two-way access to the parking garage. The widths of the two east-west
drive aisles and the north-south drive aisle are 27 and 26 feet, respectively, which meets the City of
Hayward drive aisle width standards. In order to reduce the number of conflicting movements and to
create a more orderly traffic flow, it is recommended to operate the garage driveways as a one-way
loop with access-only into the southern drive aisle and exit-only out of the northern drive-aisle. This
would provide for a better on-site circulation. The site plan also indicates a trash area located on the
ground level of the apartment building next to the long-term bicycle storage area. The two
uncovered visitor parking spaces adjacent to Drive Aisle C and outside the parking garage would
serve as a temporary staging area for trash pickup since garbage and delivery trucks would not be
able to enter the parking garage. Signage will be posted to indicate that the two visitor parking
spaces must not be occupied during trach pickup times.
The on-site circulation provides good connectivity between the residences on site and the site
access points because the drive aisles provide continuous, unimpeded connectivity between
Sorenson Road and Mission Boulevard. A preliminary analysis using truck turning templates was
conducted to determine the adequacy of on-site circulation for the truck category SU-30. Based on
the analysis, the access and site circulation design provided by Drive Aisles A, B and C would be
sufficiently wide to accommodate this type of trucks. During activities such as garbage collection,

                                                                                        Page | 19

large vehicles may have some off tracking into on-coming travel lanes. However, traffic volumes
onsite would be relatively low, and occasional encroachment of heavy vehicles into opposing traffic
lanes would not create operational problems. Because the dead-end at the end of Drive Aisle A
provide access only to residences with their own private driveways, the dead-end aisle should not
cause vehicle turnaround problems. However, prior to final design, provisions for garbage
collection on the dead-end aisle should be reviewed by City staff.

Parking Analysis
On-Site Parking Analysis
The proposed project has two components, a three-story 39-unit apartment complex with a 1,500
square feet coffee shop situated in the southern portion of the site plan and 35 townhome units at
the northern portion. Per City of Hayward's Zoning Code Section 10-2.310, a multi-family residential
unit with two or more bedrooms would require one covered and 1.1 open parking spaces. A one-
bedroom apartment unit would require one covered and 0.7 open parking spaces. The project
proposes 18 one-bedroom apartments, 21 two-bedroom apartments and 35 multi-bedroom
townhomes. Based on Hayward's Zoning Code Section 10-2.310, the apartments would require a
total of 18 * 1.7 + 21 * 2.1 = 75 parking spaces; the townhomes would require 35 * 2.1 = 74 parking
spaces and the entire project would require 149 spaces.
However, since the project site is located within the South Hayward BART/Mission Boulevard
Planning Area, per Section 10-24.245 of the South Hayward BART/Mission Boulevard Form-based
Code, a maximum of 1.75 off-street parking spaces may be provided for apartments and a
maximum 2.0 spaces maybe provided for townhomes. In addition, per Item a (i) of Section 10-
24.245 of the South Hayward BART/Mission Boulevard Form-based Code, non-residential functions
shall have no requirement for a minimum number of off-street automobile parking spaces.
Therefore, no onsite parking spaces dedicated to the coffee shop use is required. Capping the
parking supply for residential developments located near the South Hayward BART station is
intended to promote the use of public transportation and discourage residents of using, or owning,
an automobile.
Based on the parking requirements described above and shown in Table 5 below, a maximum of 68
on-site parking spaces are allowed for the apartments. The proposed site plan shows a total of 42
parking spaces with 40 covered spaces and 2 uncovered spaces on site. The townhome
component of the proposed project includes 35 multi-family units with two or more bedrooms.
Based on parking standard described above, a maximum of 70 parking spaces would be allowed.
Each of the 35 townhome units would have its own two-car garage. Together with the 8 uncovered
parking spaces, there would be a total of 78 parking spaces provided within the townhome complex.
Therefore, the parking supply for the townhomes exceeds the allowable number of parking spaces
by 8 stalls. However, assuming that the on-site parking surplus from the townhome component can
be shared with the apartment component the total parking supply for the project would be 120
spaces, which is less than, and therefore in accordance with, the allowable 138 spaces per City
Code Section 10-24.245.

1
    Based on Section 10-24.245 of South Hayw ard BART/Mission Blvd Form-based Code, a maximum of 1.75 off-street parking spaces
    may be provided for apartments and 2.00 spaces may be provided for tow nhomes.

    Based on Item a(i) of Section 10-24.245 of South Hayw ard BART/Mission Blvd Form-based Code, non-residential functions
    shall have no requirement for a minimum number of off-street automobile parking spaces.



Based on the City’s requirements, a maximum of 30 percent of the required parking spaces may be
designated for compact vehicles. The site plan shows 12 spaces out of the 42 spaces are compact
spaces, which is 29 percent of the total parking provided and therefore satisfies the City’s
requirements. The parking standards also require that 10 percent of the parking provided must be
available to visitors. Based on the current site plan, only three designated visitor parking spaces
are shown, which is less than the 10 percent required per city’s parking code.
       Recommendation #1: Prior to final design, provisions for clearly defined number of designated
       visitor spaces satisfying the City’s parking code should be reviewed by City staff.
As described above, the Hayward's Zoning Code Section 10-24.245 refers to a maximum parking
supply for residential developments but does not provide recommendations or requirements of the
minimum number of on-site parking spaces that should be provided.
In order to determine if the proposed parking supply of 120 spaces for 74 units, or 1.62 spaces per
unit, would be adequate to serve the anticipated parking demand, parking data from other sources
were collected.
ITE Parking Demand

The ITE Parking Generation, 4th edition contains information on the parking demand at apartments
and townhomes. The average peak parking demand for low/mid-rise apartments (land use code
221) is 1.23 vehicles per dwelling unit and the 85 percentile is 1.54 parked vehicles per unit. The
average peak parking demand for townhomes (land use code 230) is 1.38 vehicles per dwelling unit
and the 85 percentile is 1.52 parked vehicles per unit.

Parking Demand Surveys
Over the years, Hexagon has conducted parking surveys at numerous apartment projects in the
South Bay. The surveys considered 12 different apartment complexes, located near transit, in the
cities of Mountain View and Cupertino, all of which included on-site parking and for which the
number of one, two, and three bedroom apartments was known. Although the surveyed sites in
Cupertino and Mountain View are within reasonable walking distance (less than 0.25 mile, or about
1,300 feet) from transit, the proposed project is considered “more transit-oriented” due to its close
proximity to BART and very short walking distance to the bus stops on Mission Boulevard near
Sorenson Road. The parking occupancy surveys were conducted on weekdays around midnight at
each apartment complex. The name of each site, its proximity to transit, and the total number of
bedrooms and parking occupancy results are shown in Table 6.

The data shows that the parking demand varies from 0.91 to 1.54 parking spaces per unit. On
average, the parking demand was 1.25 occupied parking spaces per unit.

The project would provide 1.62 parking spaces per unit. Even though the parking demand for
condominiums is generally slightly higher compared to parking needs for apartments, based on the
ITE parking data and parking data at apartment buildings collected in other cities, we anticipate that
the 120 on-site parking spaces would be adequate to accommodate the parking demand for
residential use.


Neighborhood On-Street Parking Survey
City staff has expressed concerns on historical on-street parking issues in the residential
neighborhood west of the project site and may consider making that neighborhood part of the
Residential Permit Parking Program. An on-street parking survey was conducted in the single-
family residential neighborhood immediately adjacent to the project site on the following streets:
Sorenson Road, Colette Street, Luvena Drive, Colette Place, Laurette Place, Diana Place and

                                                                                                    Page | 22

Martha Place. The survey was performed between 6 PM and 9 PM on a typical weekday evening
when the on-street parking demand is the highest. Parking on Mission Boulevard is prohibited and
there are “no parking anytime” signs posted along Mission Boulevard. The entire survey area is
divided into 13 separate street segments and the on-street parking occupancy data for each
segment were collected in 30-minute intervals. The average number of parked vehicles each
segment can accommodate were also estimated based on field observation. Results of the parking
survey show that the highest demand for on-street parking occurred at approximately 9 PM on a
typical weekday with approximately 202 on-street parked vehicles. With an estimated capacity of
262 on-street parking spaces available on the 13 street segments, there would be approximately 60
unoccupied on-street parking spaces available during the peak demand period on a typical
weekday.
A map of the 13 street segments and summary tables of the parking survey is included in Appendix
A after the intersection turning movement counts.
Bicycle Parking
Based on the description on the site plan, the project would provide 3 short-term and 12 long-term
bicycle parking spaces on site. The site plan shows a long-term bike locker room on the ground
level adjacent to the trash collection area but short term bike racks cannot be identified.

   Recommendation #2: It is recommended that the project provide short term bicycle parking
   facilities on-site consistent with City requirements.

Transit, Pedestrian and Bicycle Analysis
According to the U.S. Census, pedestrian trips comprise approximately 2 percent of the total
commute mode share in the City of Hayward. For the proposed project, assuming 2 percent of total
commute trips would be walking trips, that would equate to approximately one pedestrian trip during
the AM and PM peak hours. Similarly, the U.S. Census data indicate that bicycle trips comprise less
than one-half of one percent of the total commute mode share in the City of Hayward. In addition to
commute trips, there will be pedestrian and bike trips to nearby schools, parks, shopping areas and
BART. Overall, it is anticipated that the volume of pedestrian and bike trips generated by the project
would not exceed the carrying capacity of the existing sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike facilities on
streets surrounding the site. The 2013 Alameda County Congestion Management Program (CMP)
Transportation Impact Analysis Technical Guidelines state that a project would create an impact on
pedestrian and bike circulation if: (1) its vehicle trips would present a barrier to bikes/pedestrians
safely crossing roadways, or (2) it would reduce or sever existing or planned bike/pedestrian
circulation in the area. Based on these criteria, the proposed project would not create an adverse
impact to bike/pedestrian circulation in the area.
According to the U.S. Census, bus trips comprise approximately 2 percent of the total commute
mode share in the City of Hayward. For the proposed project, assuming 2 percent of total commute
trips would be bus trips, that would equate to approximately one bus trip during the AM or PM peak
hours. In addition to commute trips, there will be additional bus trips to nearby schools, parks,
shopping areas and BART. The volume of bus rips generated by the project would not exceed the
carrying capacity of the existing transit serving the site. Therefore, no improvements to existing bus
service frequencies would be necessary in conjunction with the proposed project. In addition to bus
service, some future residents would utilize BART, which is located approximately one mile south of
the project site. According to the U.S. Census, BART trips comprise approximately 6 percent of the
total commute share in Hayward. For the proposed project, this would equate to up to
approximately 3 new BART trips during the AM and PM peak hours. To access BART, future

                                                                                      Page | 23
26601 Mission Boulevard Residential Development                                          May 10, 2017



residents could walk, bike, take the bus, or drive to the South Hayward BART station which is
approximately one mile south of the project site. BART trips to and from the proposed project would
comprise an extremely small fraction of the total BART ridership, and therefore, would not cause
any meaningful changes in BART service.
According to the 2013 Alameda County Congestion Management Program (CMP) Transportation
Impact Analysis Technical Guidelines, a project would create an impact on transit service if: (1) it
would cause vehicular congestion that would significantly degrade transit operations, (2) it would
cause a ridership increase that would exceed existing transit capacity, or (3) it would conflict with
existing transit service plans or preclude future transit service to the project area. Based on these
criteria, the proposed project would not cause a significant impact to transit operations in the study
area.
Onsite, the volume and speed of vehicular traffic would be low enough such that shared use of the
entry driveway between bikes and motor vehicles would be feasible. Pedestrian access to the site
building would be provided via a series of onsite pedestrian pathways that link to the parking areas.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The impacts of the proposed project were evaluated in accordance with the procedures and
guidelines specified by the City of Hayward. The analysis resulted in the following key findings:
      The proposed project would not result in any level of service impacts to any the study
       signalized intersections.
      The proposed project would not result in any queuing storage deficiencies at any of the
       study signalized intersections and project driveways.
      The proposed project would not create any impacts on pedestrian, bike, or transit facilities.
      The project site is located within the South Hayward BART/Mission Boulevard Planning
       Area and per Section 10-24.245, the parking requirement for the project would be a
       maximum of 138 on-site parking spaces. The site plan shows a total of 120 parking spaces,
       which is 18 stalls fewer than the maximum number of parking spaces allowed by code. The
       project would provide 1.62 parking spaces per unit. Based on the ITE parking data and
       parking data at apartment buildings collected in other Bay Area cities, it is anticipated that
       the parking supply of 120 spaces would be adequate to accommodate the parking demand
       for residential use. Per Item a (i) of Section 10-24.245 of the South Hayward BART/Mission
       Boulevard Form-based Code, non-residential functions such as a coffee shop shall have no
       requirement for a minimum number of off-street automobile parking spaces.
In addition, the analysis also produced the following recommendation:
   1. In order to reduce the number of conflicting movements and to create a more orderly traffic
      flow, it is recommended to operate the garage driveways as a one-way loop with access-
      only into the southern drive aisle and exit-only out of the northern drive-aisle.
   2. Prior to final design, provisions for clearly defined number of designated visitor spaces
      satisfying the City’s parking code should be reviewed by City staff.
   3. The site plan shows a long-term bike locker room on the ground level adjacent to the trash
      collection area but short term bike racks cannot be identified. It is recommended that the
      project provide short term bicycle parking facilities on-site consistent with City requirements.
