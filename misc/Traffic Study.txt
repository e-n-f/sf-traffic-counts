                                       Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed-use building located at the southwest corner of
the 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street intersection in downtown Seattle. As necessary,
mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce significant transportation
related impacts that the project may have on the surrounding transportation system.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the southwest corner of Second Avenue and Stewart
Street intersection, in downtown Seattle as shown on Figure 1. The proposed project would
develop up to 266 residential condo units, approximately 3,944 square feet of restaurant
space and approximately 650 square feet of retail space.

The proposed project would provide a total of approximately 63 parking spaces. Access to
the parking garage would be provided via the existing alley accessed off Stewart Street and
Pine Street. Figure 2 illustrates the preliminary site plan. It is anticipated that the development
would be constructed and occupied by 2019.

The existing building on the site would be removed as part of the project. The existing
building consists of approximately 8,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 square feet of
retail.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated with Seattle Department of Construction &
Inspections (SDCI) staff and is consistent with previous traffic studies conducted in the study
area. Based on the anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed projects, the following
intersections were selected for analysis:

    1. 3rd Avenue and Stewart Street
    2. 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street
    3. 1st Avenue and Stewart Street

Additionally, the alley access locations on Stewart Street and Pine Street were analyzed
under future (2019) with-project conditions. This study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour
when transportation impacts are anticipated to be highest. The report first describes existing
and future (2019) without-project conditions in the vicinity of the project site. This includes the
street system, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, non-motorized facilities, and transit service. Future (2019)
with-project conditions are then described. The project’s impacts on the surrounding
transportation system were identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the
future without-project conditions.

Future
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2016 – 2021 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) and the Seattle Center City Connector Environmental Evaluation, the City of Seattle is
proposing the Seattle Streetcar – the Center City Connector, a modern streetcar line in
Seattle’s Center City linking the existing SLU Streetcar and First Hill Street car lines. The
Center City Connector would serve the City of Seattle’s three downtown intermodal hubs:
Westlake Intermodal Hub, Colman Dock Intermodal Hub, and King Street Intermodal Hub. A
portion of the line is anticipated to operate along Stewart Street from 1st Avenue towards
McGraw Square. The project is to be funded as part of the President Obama’s Fiscal Year
2017 budget, which proposes a $75M grant to fund the City Connector. The City of Seattle
will release its finance plan to fund the remaining portion of the project; the finance place will
be finalized as part of the City’s 2017 budget. Construction is anticipated to begin Q1 2018
and vehicle testing and startup is projected to begin in 2020.

Traffic Volumes
The following sections summarize the traffic volumes for existing and future without-project
conditions.
Existing
Traffic counts were collected at each study intersection in November 2016. Figure 3
illustrates the existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections,
rounded to the nearest 5 vehicles. Detail traffic counts are provided in Appendix A.
Future
Future (2019) without-project traffic volumes were forecasted by applying an average annual
growth rate to existing traffic volumes as well as traffic from previously approved “pipeline”
development projects that would increase background traffic at study intersections. An annual
growth rate of 1.5 percent per year was applied to the existing PM peak hour traffic volumes
at each study intersection. The growth rate determined by discussions with SDCI. Traffic from
the following pipeline projects in the project vicinity were also included in the future without-
project volume forecasts:

        1516 2nd Avenue: 154,000 square feet of office with retail.
        1608 2nd Avenue: 16-story hotel with restaurant.
        2134 Western Avenue: This project would develop 152 residential units with 6,000
         square feet of retail.
        204 Pine Street: This project would develop 398 multifamily dwelling units with 4,300
         square feet of retail.
        3rd Ave and Lenora: This project would develop 384 residential units, 196,000
         square feet of office, and 7,000 square feet of retail.
        1931 2nd Ave: This project would develop a 205-room hotel.

Future (2019) without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes reflecting the
background growth and traffic from the pipeline projects are shown on Figure 4.


Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections such as the alley driveways, LOS is measured in average delay per
vehicle during the peak hour of traffic and is reported for the worst operating approach of the
intersection. Traffic operations for an intersection can be described alphabetically with a
range of levels of service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and
LOS F indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed
explanation of LOS criteria and definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Pedestrian and bicycle volumes were taken into account when evaluating the operations of
the intersections.

For the future without-project conditions, it was assumed that the Center City Connector
channelization changes were constructed along Stewart Street which would affect capacity at
the study intersections. Some of the key changes1 to the intersections are anticipated to
include:

            1st Avenue / Stewart Street: The northbound, southbound and westbound
             approaches would be reduced from three lanes, two lanes, and two lanes to single
             lanes respectively for general purpose use.

            2nd Avenue / Stewart Street: The westbound approach (currently providing a left turn
             only, shared through-left, and a through lane) reduced to a left turn only lane and
             shared through-left lane.
            3rd Avenue / Stewart Street: The westbound approach (currently providing a shared
             through-left, through lane, and right turn only lane) would be modified to include a
             shared through-right lane and through only lane. Left turns would be for streetcar and
             transit only (currently no left turns during peak hours for general purpose).

For signal timing changes, some of the key assumptions made for future conditions include:

            1st Avenue / Stewart Street: A streetcar signal phase included in the cycle that would
             run concurrently with the westbound phase.

            2nd Avenue / Stewart Street: A streetcar signal phase included in the cycle that
             would not overlap with any vehicle movements due to conflicts.

            3rd Avenue / Stewart Street: A streetcar signal phase included in the cycle that would
             not overlap with any of the existing phases due to conflicting movements.

The City of Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan does not define a LOS standard for individual
intersections; however, the City generally recognizes LOS E and F as poor operations for
signalized locations and LOS F for unsignalized locations. Intersection operations for existing
and future (2019) without-project weekday PM peak hour conditions are summarized in Table
2. Trip generation is documented in the subsequent Project Impact section of this study.
Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analyzed are included in Appendix C.

3.     Analyzed in HCM 2000 due to streetcar phase in future conditions. Existing operations also analyzed in HCM 2000 to be
       consistent with future traffic operations.


As shown in Table 2, all signalized intersections currently operate at LOS B during the
weekday PM peak hour. In 2019, with the growth in background traffic and
channelization/signal timing changes due to the Center City Connector, the intersections at
3rd Avenue and 2nd Avenue are anticipated to degrade to LOS C. For the 1st Avenue
intersection, operations are anticipated to degrade to LOS F due to the loss in capacity for
each approach.

Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three-year summary of accident data from
the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is for the period between January 1, 2013
and December 31, 2015. In addition to the study intersections, collision data along Stewart
Street in the study area were analyzed to evaluate the vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle safety.
This information is summarized in Table 3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning high accident location (HCL) status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. As shown in Table 3 within the
analysis period, all signalized intersections and roadway segments had 2.33 or less collisions
per year and do not meet SDOT’s HCL criteria.

In addition, SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates
of list of “high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The
review screens the previous year’s collision for signalized intersections with 10 or more
collisions in a year and locations with 5 or more pedestrian or bike collisions.

SDOT’s Draft 2016 Candidate Locations report identified the segment of 1st Avenue between
Stewart Street and Virginia Street as a mid-block high accident location for having over 10
collisions (13) in the previous year (2015).


Non-Motorized Facilities
The following describes the existing and future non-motorized facilities within the study area.
Existing
Sidewalks are provided on all streets in the study area. Marked crosswalk exists at all the
study intersections as well as other intersections in vicinity of the proposed project site. On-
street bicycle lanes are provided on 2nd Avenue along the northeast side of the street. The
2nd Avenue protected bicycle lane currently starts at Pike Street and ends at S Washington
St. The extension to S Washington Street from Yesler Way was just completed in 2016.
Future
Existing bicycle lane on 2nd Avenue will be converted to a two-way protected bicycle lane
between the current terminus at Pike Street to Denny Way in 2017. The Seattle Bicycle
Master Plan Implementation Plan 2016-2020 also includes a protected bicycle lane on 7th
Avenue (Westlake Avenue to Pike Street). The 2016 – 2021 Adopted CIP includes
multimodal corridor improvements along 3rd Avenue between S Jackson Street and Denny

Transit Service
The following sections describe existing and future transit service within the study area.

Existing
Bus transit service in the study area is provided by King County Metro Transit, Community
Transit, and Sound Transit. The nearest bus stop to the proposed development is located on
the west side of 2nd Avenue between Stewart Street and Pine Street providing 23 different
bus routes. Within ¼-mile of the site, 73 total transit are provided and operated by King
County Metro, Community Transit, and Sound Transit.

Within less than a ¼-mile walking distance of the proposed project during weekday peak
commute periods (6:00 – 9:00 AM and 3:00 – 6:30 PM), 3rd Avenue restricts through traffic to
transit vehicles only. 3rd Avenue is served by RapidRide C, D, and E lines as well as multiple
frequent transit lines to North, Central, and South Seattle neighborhoods. Additional transit
stops are also located on 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue, Lenora Street, and Virginia Street. The
Westlake Station in the Downtown Transit Tunnel is approximately four blocks from the site
and has frequent bus and Central Link light rail service as well as peak hour bus commuter
routes connecting the site to not only Seattle but the Puget Sound region.
Future
The proposed Center City Connector streetcar is projected to being testing in 2020 and
anticipated to run on Stewart Street from 1st Avenue to McGraw Square. The system is
projected to carry up to 30,000 weekday riders and will serve the City of Seattle’s three
intermodal hubs including Westlake Intermodal Hub, Colman Dock Intermodal Hub, and King
Street Intermodal Hub. The Connector will provide convenient transfers to the 3rd Avenue
Transit Spine at both ends of Downtown, to Link Light Rail via multiple Downtown Seattle
Transit Tunnel (DSTT) station entries, and to Sounder Commuter Rail at King Street Station.
During peak periods, the streetcar is anticipated to arrive every 5 minutes.

                                    Project Impacts
This section documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding street system and
identifies potential mitigation measures where necessary.


Trip Generation
The number of new trips generated by the proposed project was estimated by calculating the
trip generation of each of the proposed uses on-site. The net new trips generated takes into
account the current trips on the network, which are being generated by the existing uses on-
site.

Project trip generation was estimated based on calculating person trips and then estimating
the proportion of the person trips that would be vehicle trips. Most Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates are for suburban locations and over-predict the number
of vehicle trips in an urban environment, which typically has a larger portion of trips served by
alternative modes such as walking, biking, and transit given the mix of development and level
of transit service.

The trip generation estimate used in this study considers the use of alternative modes of
travel. The number of overall vehicle trips generated was determined by calculating person
trips for weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour conditions and then separating the person
trips by mode of travel (i.e., auto, transit, and walk/bike/other). The flow chart below illustrates
the trip generation process.




Total person trips were developed for the existing and proposed land uses based on trip rates
from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. Average vehicle occupancy (AVO) was
estimated from the Trip Generation Manual for the existing general office (#710) and the
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating

Techniques for Urban Planning for the proposed residential condos, retail, and restaurant
uses.

Residential person trips using each transportation mode were determined by multiplying the
total person trips by the estimated mode splits from the US Census 2009-2013 American
Community Survey 5-year Estimates Commuting Characteristics.2 The survey shows a 31
percent auto mode split for census tract 81 where the project is located. After applying the
auto mode split, residential person trips were then converted back to vehicle trips by
assuming an AVO of 1.00.3

The Commute Seattle’s 2014 Center City Commuter Mode Split report summarizes Commute
Trip Reduction (CTR) data by Seattle neighborhood. The data shows, for the Belltown
neighborhood, 30 percent of employee trips were made by auto (25 percent drove alone and
5 percent carpooled), 51 percent by transit, and 19 percent walking, biking, or other modes.
After applying the auto mode split, office person trips were then converted back to vehicle
trips by using average vehicle occupancies of 1.13.4

The restaurant and retail uses are anticipated to serve the local area including residents and
employees living and working nearby. This would result in a high proportion of walking trips to
and from the surrounding neighborhood. The analysis assumes that 15 percent of the retail
and restaurant customers would drive to the site. The AVO rates used were consistent with
the retail and restaurant rates of 1.48 and 1.69 respectively found in National Cooperative
Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 365 Travel Estimating Techniques for Urban
Planning.

Appendix D provides the detailed trip generation calculation. Table 4 summarizes the
estimated weekday daily and AM and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed and
existing land uses.

Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based on guidance
from the Director’s Rule 5-2009, OnTheMap, as well as a review of existing travel patterns,
planned improvements, and previous studies conducted in the area.

OnTheMap is a web-based mapping and reporting application, which shows where workers
are employed and where they live based on census data. The OnTheMap census data were
translated to the number of people that live within a quarter-mile radius of the proposed
project and where they work. The zip codes where people work were evaluated to determine
if a person would be more likely to travel to the zip code via vehicle or by other means. Trips
to zip codes closer to the proposed project site or in more transit oriented locations are more
likely to use transit, walk, bike, or other non-SOV modes. Zip codes outside the Seattle City
limits and/or further from the site are more likely to drive.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the expected project outbound and inbound vehicle trip
distribution for the proposed project respectively, to the surrounding local and regional street
system. The weekday PM peak hour trips were assigned to the study area based on the
travel patterns and the location of the site access. The project would provide access via the
alley way between 1st Avenue and 2nd Avenue on Pine Street and Stewart Street. The
distribution and assignment considers the primary travel routes within the gridded street
system where project impacts would be greatest. It is recognized that drivers may take
alternative routes; however, it is anticipated that impacts along these facilities would be less
than disclosed in this analysis.

The project traffic was added to 2019 future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic
volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. The resulting 2019 with-project traffic
volumes are shown on Figure 7.

Traffic Volume Impact
Table 5 summarizes the project traffic volume impact at the study intersections during the
weekday PM peak hour for the project site.

As shown in Table 5, the percent traffic volume impacts are less than approximately 2
percent at the study intersections and approximately 12 percent at the access alley locations.
Traffic volumes typically fluctuate day-to-day by five to ten percent depending on factors such
as day of the week, weather conditions, and traffic conditions elsewhere in the surrounding
network. The increase in traffic volumes related to project traffic at the study intersections fall
within these normal fluctuations and will likely go unnoticed by the majority of roadway users
in the study area. The higher project shares are due to the low traffic volumes at those
respective study intersections.


Traffic Operations Impact
Future with-project LOS analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour to analyze
traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methods were applied as described for
future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters such as channelization and
traffic control were consistent with those used in the evaluation of future without-project
conditions including the streetcar channelization and signal timing changes. A comparison of
future without and with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is summarized for
the project site in Table 6. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 6, overall impacts to the study intersections would generally be minimal
increases to delay. Typically, the City does not consider an impact at intersections operating
at LOS E or F or if an intersection degrades from LOS D, significant if it is a less than 5
second increase in delay. As such the proposed project is not anticipated to have significant
impacts at the study intersections.

Alley Operations and Impact
The proposed project includes a lower level garage. Access to the garage would be provided
via the alley accessed off Stewart Street and Pine Street.

The alley south of the proposed project accessed off Stewart Street and Pine Street (See
Figure 2) operates as a two-way alley and contains two garage driveways associated with the
101 Stewart Street Building (approximately 90,000 square feet office and commercial
building). One of the existing driveways (north driveway) is across from the proposed garage
entry for the 2nd and Stewart project. The south driveway is approximately 25 feet south of
the north driveway. Field observations were conducted at this alley during the PM peak (4:00
– 6:00 p.m.) in order to analyze existing alley operations and the proposed project’s impact.

During the peak PM two-hour period, there were 34 total vehicles observed using the alley.
Of the 34 vehicles, 4 vehicles were going to/from the north driveway, 13 vehicles going
to/from the south driveway, and the remaining 17 vehicles were either passing or unloading.
Overall, there was minimal loading activity which included two trucks parked/unloading near
the north driveway for approximately 5 minutes each.

The proposed project is anticipated to generate 56 gross new PM peak hour trips. Included
as part of the project is a trash and residential loading area which allows those activities to
occur on-site and not in the alley.

Table 7 summarizes the anticipated alley operations, which as mentioned above, accounts
for channelization changes due to the streetcar. The operations at the site accesses were
analyzed consistent with the above analysis. At side-street stop-controlled intersections LOS
is measured in average delay per vehicle during the peak hour of traffic and is reported for
the worst operating approach of the intersection.

2.   Average delay per vehicle in seconds.
3.   Worst movement reported for unsignalized intersections.


As shown in Table 7, the Stewart alley access is anticipated to operate at LOS D during
future with-project conditions.

Due to the high number of pedestrians (over 500 pedestrians per hour) crossing on the
existing sidewalk at Pine Street, the Pine Street access is anticipated to operate at LOS E
during future without and with-project conditions. The Synchro analysis assumes no yielding
behavior from the constant flow of pedestrians. It is expected that, like many other Downtown
Seattle driveways, pedestrians and vehicles would mutually yield to each other to allow turns
out of high pedestrian activity locations.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

The screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that were
analyzed for concurrency review include East of CBD (Screenline 12.12) and South of Lake
Union (Screenline 8) as shown in Table 8. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that
all project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the screenlines would extend across
the screenlines included in this analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the proposed
project the screenlines would have v/c ratios that are less than the City v/c threshold; thus,
the project would meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following sections describe the proposed parking supply and estimated peak parking
demand of the project.
Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by a lower level garage with a total of 63
stalls. Access to the parking garage would be provided via the alley accessed off Stewart
Street and Pine Street.
Demand
The peak parking demand is expected to be below national averages due the project’s
proximity to transit service and its relative location in Downtown, a high-density urban village
with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. As opportunities for transit,
car share, etc. increase and with employment in the immediate vicinity of the site, it is
anticipated vehicle ownership and the need for parking will decrease.

The peak parking demand for the proposed project was estimated based on data provided in
ITE Parking Generation (4th Edition), local mode of travel data consistent with the trip
generation analysis, and local vehicle ownership data.5 This approach is consistent with
approved traffic studies conducted in the vicinity of the site. Detailed calculations are
provided in Appendix E. The peak parking demand of the development would generally occur
overnight.

The site is in census tract 81. An analysis was completed to estimate the approximate on-site
peak parking demand of the proposed development accounting for each land use’s different
time of peak parking demand over the course of a typical day. Detailed calculations are
provided in Appendix E.

The parking rate used to estimate the peak parking demand for the condo use (0.98 vehicles
per unit) is based on average vehicle ownership6 from US Census data. Based on the
proposed mix of condo units,7 the associated parking rates are shown in Table 9. A visitor
parking demand rate of 0.05 vehicles per unit was assumed based on data provided in
previously approved transportation studies in the area.8 Table 9 provides a summary of the
estimated parking demand for the site.

Note: du = dwelling units, ksf = 1,000 square feet


As shown in Table 9, the estimated peak parking demand associated with residential parking
is approximately 274 vehicles, and the peak parking demand associated with retail and
restaurant is approximately 5 vehicles, totaling 279 vehicles if both uses peaked at the same
time. The peak overnight demand is anticipated to be approximately 274 and would not be
accommodated in the proposed supply of 63 parking spaces, resulting in a potential parking
overspill of 211 vehicles.

The parking demand calculated above is based on current census data and may not properly
reflect the planned transit improvements in the area. Given the high-density urban village
nature of the area and the planned transit improvements it is likely that dependence on
vehicles will decrease resulting in a decrease in the anticipated peak parking demand.


Off-Street Parking Analysis
An off-street parking utilization study was conducted over multiple weekday evenings, when
peak overspill demand is anticipated to occur, in December 2016 to evaluate existing off-
street monthly paid parking supply and demand. It is expected that on-site residents would
utilize off-street parking facilities once on-site parking is unavailable. Based on data found on
Seattle Parking Map9, Table 10 provides a summary of the parking utilization study within
approximately 800 feet from the project site. Detailed information and parking calculations are
shown in Appendix E.

1.   Based on parking information found on Seattle Parking Map and real time ePark demand data during overnight hours.
2.   Number of spaces that the proposed project would occupy based on demand calculations and parking overspill.
3.   Based on a review of the pipeline developments within walking distance from the proposed site and analysis of each pipeline
     project’s parking overspill. Detailed calculations can be found in Appendix E.


As shown in the table, there is a total off-street parking supply of approximately 1,207 spaces
within 800-feet walking distance of the project site. During overnight hours (peak residential
demand period), it was observed that only 278 parking spaces (23%) were occupied. After
considering pipeline projects’ overspill and the proposed project’s overspill, there would be
635 remaining spaces for use.

The parking demand analysis noted above utilizes parking rates that are more representative
of unconstrained conditions. Given the without-project conditions and saturation of parking,
combined with the planned Center City Connector streetcar in the area, parking rates would
likely be less than noted. As such, the overspill noted above should be considered a worst
case condition.

Transportation Impact Analysis
2nd and Stewart                                                                      February 2017



                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the mixed-use development
located at 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street in the Downtown neighborhood of Seattle. General
findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would construct 266 residential condo units, 3,944 square
           feet of restaurant space, and 650 square feet of retail.
          After accounting for the existing land uses on the project site, the development is
           anticipated to generate 545 net new vehicular weekday daily trips with 42
           net new trips occurring during the weekday AM peak hour and 49 net new trips
           during the PM peak hour.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via the alley between 1st
           and 2nd Avenue.
          The off-site study intersections on Stewart Street are anticipated to operate at LOS
           C, LOS C, and LOS F on 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and 3rd Avenue respectively.
           The proposed project is not anticipated to have significant impacts at the study
           intersections.
          The two alley access locations at Stewart Street and Pine Street would operate at
           LOS D and E respectively during with-project conditions.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The parking supply for the proposed project is 63 vehicle parking stalls and may not
           accommodate the peak overnight parking demand of 271 vehicles. After a review of
           off-street parking supply and demand during overnight hours, it was found that 847
           spaces were available and would be able to accommodate the project’s parking
           overspill.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of the average total vehicle
delay of all movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time. Specifically, LOS
criteria are stated in terms of average delay per vehicle during a specified time period (for
example, the PM peak hour). Vehicle delay is a complex measure based on many variables,
including signal phasing (i.e., progression of movements through the intersection), signal cycle
length, and traffic volumes with respect to intersection capacity. Table 1 shows LOS criteria for
signalized intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, Special Report 209, 2000).

Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-
way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled. All-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is
expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of the movements, much like that of a
signalized intersection. Two-way, stop-controlled intersection LOS is defined in terms of the
average vehicle delay of an individual movement(s). This is because the performance of a two-
way, stop-controlled intersection is more closely reflected in terms of its individual movements,
rather than its performance overall. For this reason, LOS for a two-way, stop-controlled
intersection is defined in terms of its individual movements. With this in mind, total average
vehicle delay (i.e., average delay of all movements) for a two-way, stop-controlled intersection
should be viewed with discretion. Table 2 shows LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections (both
all-way and two-way, stop-controlled).
