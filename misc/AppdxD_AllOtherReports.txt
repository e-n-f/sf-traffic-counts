Introduction

The City of Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) proposes to replace two existing bridges
(East and West Bridge) on Fairview Avenue North, with a single new bridge spanning a portion of the
southeast shoreline of Lake Union, in Seattle, Washington (Figure 1). The project is located within the
northwest quarter of Section 19, Township 25 North, Range 04 East.

During the initial screening and preliminary evaluation of alternatives phase of the project, SDOT
evaluated many elements as part of the preliminary design process prior to selecting the proposed
project. This report has been prepared to document the process and analyses used to arrive at the
decision to advance the preferred project.

The existing bridges consist of two side-by-side structures, and a floating pedestrian walkway in lake
Union (Figure 2). The West Bridge, built in 1948, carries one lane of southbound traffic and one mixed
use (bicycle and pedestrian) lane. The East Bridge, built in 1963 carries two northbound lanes and a
sidewalk. The West Bridge has a concrete deck and is supported on creosote treated timber piles,
many of which are deteriorated and in poor condition or previously repaired. The East Bridge has a
superstructure consisting of prestressed concrete girders with a cast-in-place concrete deck supported
on pre-cast concrete piles. The existing girders on the East Bridge have shear cracks at the ends near
the piers which are impacting the bridges sufficiency rating.

Purpose and Need

The purpose of this project is to maintain the transportation function and capacity on Fairview Avenue
North and improve safety within the roadway corridor by replacing the existing deteriorating bridges
with a new structure. The project is needed because the existing bridges are aging and do not meet
current seismic or design standards and will not accommodate a street car in the future.

The new roadway section needs to be approximately 65 feet wide to accommodate two northbound
travel lanes, one southbound travel lane, a two-way cycle track, sidewalks along the east and west side
of the bridge, and meet current standards for lane widths. The number of travel lanes is the same as the
existing condition. The City’s South Lake Union Streetcar line currently terminates approximately 0.15
mile southwest of the bridges. There are no formal proposals to extend the streetcar line northward,
but SDOT has determined that the planned replacement for the existing bridges should be designed to
accommodate the streetcar. The new mixed use trail/sidewalk and cycle track will provide connectivity
for the Cheshiahud Lake Union Loop trail within the project corridor and will replace existing
pedestrian and bicycle facilities that do not meet current design standards.

Screening and Preliminary Evaluation of Alternatives

A Type, Size and Location (TS&L) report was prepared to document and compile all the analysis and
investigations that were completed to establish a preferred alternative for advancing the project to final
design and construction. The design standards that apply to the project are summarized in Appendix A
of the TS&L report (HNTB and Perteet, July 2013). The alternatives evaluation and screening process
involved identifying, evaluating, and screening a range of roadway fill, bridge replacement, and bridge
rehabilitation alternatives to identify a preferred alternative. This process included the following:

        Developing design criteria and alternative conceptual designs,

        Identifying evaluation criteria for the alternatives screening,

        Evaluating the feasibility of alternatives, and

        Conducting a series of alternatives screening meetings with the City to select a preferred
         alternative.

Preliminary Alternatives

SDOT directed the pre-design engineering team to evaluate three basic options to address the issues of
the structural deficiency of the West and East Bridges. The first scenario was to completely replace the
two existing bridge structures with a new roadway fill embankment. An embankment fill option was
proposed because it addressed perceived constructability issues with a structural alternative, potentially
had less impacts resulting from noise and vibration as a structural alternative and would eliminate the
long term operations and maintenance cost of a structure. The second option was the complete
replacement of the two existing bridges with a single new structure. The third option included the
replacement of the existing West Bridge and the rehabilitation of the existing East Bridge to provide two
structures with similar anticipated service lives.

Based on these options, SDOT identified 10 initial concepts that were evaluated at a preliminary
screening level. These concepts included three fill alternatives, four complete bridge replacement
alternatives, and three West Bridge replacement only alternatives. These initial concepts were not
complete project alternatives, rather they were intended to represent a wide range of technologies and
techniques available at that time to address the purpose and need of the project.

From the 10 initial concepts, SDOT developed three project alternatives for formal evaluation:

Fairview Avenue North Bridge


       Roadway Fill Alternative (identified as alternative F1 in the TS&L report) – Roadway
        embankment fill section supported by retaining walls with a fill slope extending into Lake Union.

       Complete Replacement (identified as alternative C5 in the TS&L report) – Full replacement of
        the West and East Bridges with a prestressed concrete girder superstructure supported on 8-
        foot-diameter drilled shaft foundations.

       Replace West Bridge and Rehabilitate East Bridge (identified as alternative R4 in the TS&L
        report) – Replace the West Bridge with a new bridge adjacent to the existing East Bridge
        constructed with a prestressed concrete girder superstructure supported on 8-foot-diameter
        drilled shaft foundations.

Roadway Fill Alternative

The Roadway Fill Alternative would completely replace the existing East and West Fairview Avenue
North Bridges with a roadway fill section (Figure 3). An extensive amount of fill would be placed in Lake
Union. Fill above the ordinary high water mark would be retained using structural earth walls.

During construction the roadway section would be shifted east to facilitate the staging needed to
maintain two lanes of traffic and one sidewalk.

The roadway fill alternative would be constructed in two phases. During the first phase, the existing
West Bridge would be demolished followed by construction of the western half of the fill, walls, and
ground improvements. The second phase would demolish the East Bridge and construct the remaining
portion of the fill, walls, and ground improvements.

Full Bridge Replacement Alternative

The Full Bridge Replacement Alternative evaluated as part of the TS&L report would completely replace
the existing East and West Fairview Avenue North Bridges with a single bridge (Figure 4). The proposed
replacement bridge was a 410-foot long structure consisting of three 135-foot-long spans with the
northern abutment located at the northern end of the existing bridges. The new southern abutment
would be north of the existing East and West Bridge abutments by approximately 72 feet and 91 feet,
respectively. This was proposed to reduce costs compared to the cost of constructing a longer
structure that would more closely match the spans of the existing bridges.

The bridge substructure would consist of two intermediate piers and two abutments on drilled shaft
foundations.

The full replacement bridge would be constructed in two phases. During the first phase, the existing
West Bridge would be demolished followed by construction of the western half of the new bridge. The
second phase would demolish the East Bridge and construct the remaining portion of the replacement
bridge.

West Bridge Replacement and East Bridge Rehabilitation Alternative

The West Bridge Replacement and East Bridge Rehabilitation Alternative (West Bridge Replacement)
would replace only the existing West Bridge (Figure 5). The bridge configuration and layout would be
nearly identical to the Full Bridge Replacement Alternative except that only the first phase of the bridge
would be constructed during this project and would have a width of 32 feet. The second phase could be
constructed at later date when it becomes necessary to replace the existing East Bridge. This would be
required if the South Lake Union Streetcar line were extended across the bridge because the existing
East Bridge is not capable of supporting the streetcar loading.

The key difference between Phase 1 of Full Bridge and the West Bridge Alternatives would be the
placement of median barriers on the new West Bridge and the existing East Bridge due to the raised
profile of the new West Bridge. A portion of the East Bridge deck would need to be reconstructed to
support the barrier. In addition to this change, the existing East Bridge would be evaluated during final
design for strengthening and seismic retrofit which could include jacketing of the existing prestressed
pile supports.

The roadway section would be shifted west to facilitate the staging needed to maintain two lanes of
traffic and one sidewalk during construction. The wider bridge would require relocation of the floating
walkway. This relocation would also provide opportunities to improve ADA accessibility to the floating
walkway.

Secondary Screening and Additional Geotechnical Analysis

SDOT conducted a secondary screening process to further evaluate the three project alternatives. All
of the alternatives involve significant design and constructability challenges relating to in-water work,
ground improvement below the lake bottom, construction under traffic, and physical constraints such as
adjacent buildings and overhead high voltage power lines.

The most substantive challenge in relation to cost was the potential need for ground improvements
because of anticipated poor soil conditions. SDOT conducted additional investigations to provide more
geotechnical information to assist with the secondary screening and those investigations confirmed the
presence of poor soil conditions throughout most of the project corridor and also identified evidence of
past landslide activity at the bridge site.

After conducting additional detailed analyses, SDOT determined that the Roadway Fill alternative was
not feasible because the mass of fill in relationship to the landslide geometry decreased the stability of
the embankment during a design-level seismic event, thus increasing the risk to adjacent properties.
Similarly, SDOT determined that the proposed West Bridge Replacement and East Bridge Rehabilitation
Alternative was not feasible because of the anticipated risks and costs needed to mitigate seismic
concerns to meet suitable life safety requirements during a design-level earthquake. The Full
Replacement Alternative was determined to be feasible. A summary comparison of the key differences
among the alternatives is outlined in Table 1.

No Action Alternative and Offsite Alternative

The structural insufficiency of the existing West Bridge indicates that without replacement it will likely
be closed before the East Bridge. No action would result in Fairview Avenue North being reduced to
two sub-standard width lanes on the East Bridge and no accessible bike lane and eventually the East
Bridge would require replacement or rehabilitation or would need to be closed. Although not formally
developed to the extent of other concepts, the complete closure of both bridges would require traffic,
bicyclists, and pedestrians be accommodated by a defacto offsite alternative that would involve either
constructing a new surface bypass or rerouting traffic elsewhere within the existing street network.
Fairview Avenue North carries 8,700 vehicles per day, with an average weekday traffic volume of 9,900
vehicles per day (HNTB 2013), and is a major travel route along the east shore of Lake Union,
connecting downtown Seattle and South Lake Union with the University of Washington to the north
and the existing road network cannot accommodate this additional traffic. A bypass is not feasible
because there is no upland route available within the project vicinity that would accommodate the traffic
volumes and the pedestrian and bicycle volumes associated with the Cheshiahud Trail; all adjacent
properties are developed or are proposed for development. Based on current and projected traffic
volumes in the corridor neither the No Action Alternative nor an Offsite Alternative were considered
feasible.

Proposed Project

SDOT’s conclusions at the completion of the TS&L study was to construct the Full Bridge Replacement
Alternative (Alternative C5 in the TS&L report). Following the TS&L study during final design, SDOT
elected to modify the previously proposed Full Bridge Replacement by lengthening the bridge to allow
the new structure to span locations of fill at the south end of the bridge and to set the abutment back
from the bank at the north end of the bridge. This added an additional span and bent, but avoided the
need for ground improvements on both the north and south ends of the bridge and the need for in-
water work at the north end of the bridge.

The current proposed project is similar to Full Replacement Alternative described in the TS&L report in
that it includes replacement of both the East and West Bridges (Figure 6). The current design has a
longer bridge (540 feet long vs. 410 feet long under the TS&L Full Replacement Alternative) (Figure 6).
The longer bridge eliminates the need for fill within Lake Union at the southern approach. The current
proposal essentially replaces the existing bridges with an in-kind structure.

The proposed bridge replacement consists of four 135-foot-long spans with the northern abutment
located approximately 35 feet north of the northern end of the existing bridges. The new bridge will be
supported on 8 foot diameter drilled shafts installed to an approximate depth of 140 feet or more.
Drilled shaft construction will also require construction of two temporary work trestles, constructed on
temporary piles. The project also includes reconstruction of the roadway approaches on the north and
south side of the bridge and relocation of underground and underwater utilities. The proposed new
roadway will not add capacity and will include three travel lanes, a cycle track, and two sidewalks. The
project will temporarily relocate and slightly modify the existing floating walkway presently connected to
the West Bridge. The relocated floating walkway will have a new anchorage system of steel piles and will
be located approximately 10 feet further west than its current location.

Documentation of Environmental Baseline and Impacts

Prior to initiating the review of the Fairview Avenue North Bridge Replacement Project, SDOT and
their consultant team met with Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Highways
and Local Programs regional and environmental staff to review the project and identify key disciplines
for additional documentation. These included: transportation, noise, contaminated materials, water
resources, geology, environmental justice, and fish, wildlife, and vegetation.

SDOT has prepared stand alone discipline reports to document the existing environmental baseline and
impacts of the proposed project for all these elements except Visual Analysis.

SDOT has also prepared a Biological Assessment and Cultural Resources Discipline Report to facilitate
required consultation pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, respectively.

A brief summary of the environmental baseline and impacts related to visual quality are included below.

Visual Analysis

Replacement of the Fairview Avenue North Bridge will essentially be an in-kind replacement. The
existing views within the immediate vicinity will be slightly altered from current conditions. The view
changes both to and from the new bridge would be similar for all proposed alternatives, and differences
between alternatives are not discernible.

During the 24-month construction period there will be heavy duty construction equipment within the
project site, which could alter existing views in the area during the construction period.

This project is an in-kind replacement of the existing Fairview Avenue North Bridge structure. The
views to and from Lake Union will be largely maintained; however, the entire existing bridge
substructure above the mud line or existing grade will be removed which currently obscures views of
the Steam Plant from the lake. Once completed, the new bridge will be slightly higher and crowned, and
will extend further into Lake Union than the existing bridge. These changes with the new bridge will
alter views to and from the Steam Plant (ZymoGenetics), which is a designated Seattle landmark.

Conclusion

Based upon the recommendations in the TS&L report and subsequent investigations and decisions by
SDOT, the proposed project that is moving forward with design is a 540 feet long bridge, consisting of
four 135-foot-long spans with the northern abutment located approximately 35 feet north of the
northern end of the existing bridges. The new bridge will be supported on 8 foot diameter drilled shafts
installed to an approximate depth of 120 feet or more. Drilled shaft construction will also require
construction of two temporary work trestles, constructed on temporary piles. The project also includes
reconstruction of the roadway approaches on the north and south side of the bridge and relocation of
underground and underwater utilities. The proposed new bridge will not add capacity and will include
three travel lanes, a cycle track, and two sidewalks. The project will temporarily relocate and slightly
modify the existing floating walkway presently connected to the West Bridge. The relocated floating
walkway will have a new anchorage system of steel piles and will be located approximately 10 feet

further west than its current location. The bridge will essentially be an in-kind replacement; however,
minor changes both to and from the bridge will occur as a result of the replacement.

     cost, reduce risk, and meet a reasonable construction schedule.

     This Construction Methods Technical Memoranda is based upon the construction
     sequence planned for the 4-Span Bridge Alternative (Option 6) for the Fairview
     Bridge Replacement project.

2.0 - Current Construction Constraints:

  2.1 Work Windows - There are a number of construction activities that require
  high crane booms and drilling masts that will extend into the safe zone of the
  energized power line and many of these same construction activities must be
  conducted within the In-Water-Work-Window.

  Currently the In-Water-Work-Window is from October 1 to April 15 and overhead
  115KV Bonneville Power Lines currently allow, upon approval, a 30 day power
  outage within the months of April 1 to October 1.

  Unfortunately these two windows only overlap by two weeks each year (April 1 to
  April 15) and there are no guarantees or reassurances that either or both work
  windows can be extended so that they will overlap for a greater length of time.

  2.2 Vibratory and Impact pile driving hammers - cannot be used due to
  the sensitive equipment used by an adjacent business (24 hours/day and 7
  days/week).

  2.3 Noise Restrictions - other than a limited number of days, the close
  proximity of the construction activities to the Equinox Apartments and the Silver
  Cloud Inn will most likely be restricted to the hours between 6 am and 10 pm.

  2.4 Traffic - A minimum of one-lane in each direction must be maintained through
  the project site, except for night time full time closures between 9 pm and 6 am.
3.0 Assumptions Used to Develop the Construction Methods and
Schedule
   1) Notice to Proceed (NTP): occurs not later than January 15, 2015.
            Bid process would be in November of 2014;
            Contract awarded and executed in December of 2014.
            Contractor would be able to mobilize project by January 15, 2015.
   2) In-Water-Work-Window: Bid Documents will include an approved; extended In-
      Water-Work-Window (IWWW) from October 1 to June 1, 2015. The current
      IWWW is October 1 to April 15.
   3) Power Outage: Bid Documents will included an approved extended power outage
      from Bonneville Power and SCL for a 3 month minimum power outage (April 1 to
      July 1, 2015) which falls within the allowable window of April 1 to Sept 15. An
      Outage is needed for West Bridge construction operations of drilling permanent
      and temporary shafts, setting of temporary trestle, and the setting of the precast
      girders. The East Bridge is farther away from the power lines and will not need
      an outage.
   4) Vibration: Foundations for temporary work trestles and permanent piers will
      require drilled shafts to minimize the vibration that may affect sensitive
      experiment and testing equipment at nearby businesses.
   5) Construction Work Hours: It is anticipated that during the extended outages, the
      contractor would be allowed to work extended hours for double shift operations
      and weekends in order to lessen the risk on scheduled activities during these
      critical time frames. Extended hours could also be allowed in order to help
      accelerate the overall completion of the project and mitigate the time impact on
      the public and adjacent businesses.
   6) Contaminated Materials have been identified at the site.
   7) Trolley Lines will be de-energized and removed for construction and will be re-
      instated upon completion of construction.
   8) Walkway from ZYMOGENETICS would be out of service during construction and
      will be restored when construction is completed.



4.0 - Construction Planning Phase
One of the most critical phases of this Project will the construction planning stage, which
is the period between the Contract Execution (Mid-December 2014) and the beginning
of on-site activities (March 1, 2015). During this "Planning Phase" the Contractor must
submit and receive Approvals for most of the required project "Submittals" and Permits.
In addition Subcontracts and Purchase Orders must be executed, and critical
Procurements such as the precast girders must be into fabrication. Without the
Approvals, it is highly unlikely that the accelerated work activities that occur in the
concurrent Power Outage Window and In-Water-Work-Window will be completed by
July 1, 2015 resulting in a one year shutdown and delay of the Project.

To minimize the risk of delaying the project the Contractor must accelerate the
"Planning", Submittals and procurements and the Owner must also accelerate their
efforts in the review and approval of the Submittals. To be successful, the Contractor,
Owner, and Engineers will need to cooperatively solve and expedite any issues within
the Submittals, Applications or Contract Documents.

5.0 On-Site Activities after NTP but prior to April 1, 2015 and the
Power Outage Window
  5.1 Preconstruction activities:

           Secure staging areas and set up on-site office
           De-Energize and remove existing Trolley lines
           Install BMP's and TESC per approved Plan
           Remove and store existing Dock
           In water debris clean up
           Testing of existing water conditions
           Set up of silt curtain and silt fencing
           Set up area for contaminated material that would need to be handled;
           Set up Traffic Control and move traffic into one-lane each way on the
            existing East Bridge. Close West Bridge to Traffic.
           Remove portions of existing West Bridge that can be performed without
            impact to the Power lines. The existing West Bridge Roadway can be
            removed sawing the deck into sections and lifting/removing them using
            Excavators that will provide clearances from the power lines.
           Pre-fabrication of the work trestle


6.0 Temporary Drilled Shafts for Work Trestle: (Power Outage
Window & IWWW needed)
  This activity requires it to be performed during the Power Outage and the IWWW.

  Temporary Drilled Shafts are used to minimize noise and vibration to surrounding
  buildings, businesses, and underlying soil. Normally these temporary shafts would
  be driven piling that are installed using a vibratory or impact hammer.

  Prior to removal of the existing West Bridge Deck, cut a 3 foot square hole in the
  concrete deck at the shaft locations and drill a 24-inch steel casing to the design
  depth through the hole. There are several pieces of drilling equipment that can
  perform the work, but all will have tall masts or booms that will infringe upon the
  setback clearances for the Power Lines.
7.0 Westbound Bridge Deck Removal and Work Trestle:

  This work operation will involve 3 activities:
        1. Concrete deck removal
        2. Placing a 2 foot sand blanket over the contaminated lakebed under the
            worksite
        3. Installing the steel girders and decking for the work trestle

  To maintain access to the operation, the activities would be sequenced in each span
  until the work trestle decking is installed. The operation will then move forward to the
  next span. This will be repeated until the work trestle is completed across the lake.


  7.1 Concrete Bridge Deck Removal: (Power Outage and IWWW Only) Saw cut the
  deck into sections that can be easily lifted and places onto a truck for disposal. The
  saw cutting will eliminate demolition debris from entering the water.

     Schedule: Estimated to take 6 weeks working 2 shifts.

     Equipment:

             1.   Track Hoe with thumb or/and demolition head attachment
             2.   Crane to lift sections of the deck and place into trucks
             3.   Dump Trucks or Tractor/Trailer with demolition bed.
             4.   Tractor trailer with flatbed
             5.   Large Concrete Saw

  7.2 Sand Blanket: (IWWW only) Place during deck removal operations. The two
  (2) foot thick sand blanket fill is being placed to contain and minimize disruption of
  existing contaminated soils. The sand materials could be placed with the track hoe
  or a crane with a skip box.

  7.3 Work Bridge: (Power Outage and IWWW) Will commence at one end of the
  bridge following behind the deck removal and sand blanket operation. Install steel
  cap beams and stringers for structural members, and set prefabricated deck
  sections. The deck sections will be constructed to be removable for access during
  construction of the new piers 2, 3, 4. This work operation will require the power
  outage and extended IWWW.

  Pre-fabricate or panelize the decking system to help expedite the operation.
  Installation of stringers and deck will follow the existing concrete deck removal
  operation and will set from the completed portions of the Work Bridge. This
  operation will require cranes to handle the steel members and deck panels.

     Schedule: Estimated to take 4 weeks, working 2 shifts. The completed work
          trestle would lag behind the deck removal about 14 days.

     Equipment:
             1. Track Hoe with drill mast for piles;
             2. Crane for handling of steel members and decking;
             3. Welder for steel frame system;
                4. Forklift for handling materials.

  7.4 Remove Existing Timber Piles: (IWWW only) Will be completed during deck
  removal operation or work trestle operation. After a 2-foot sand blanket has been
  place over the contaminated lake bed, use a track mounted excavator to grab the
  timber pile and snap them off at or below the existing mudline.

  7.5 Remove Existing Concrete Piles: (IWWW only)- These will be saw cut at the
  existing mudline which is below the 2-foot layer of sand. Divers will be used for this
  operation. This operation is not on the critical path and can be performed at any time
  during the In-Water-Work-Window.

8.0 West Bridge Substructure


  8.1 Drill new Shafts/Rebar Cage/Place Concrete: (Power Outage and IWWW) -
  This operation will be accomplished from the work bridge and will require SCL power
  outage and an extended IWWW. The pier columns are designed to be
  approximately 150 feet and will require high mast equipment and crane work. The
  pier construction will start with set-up of equipment and materials in place. Drilling
  will commence and removal of materials will need to be monitored for potential
  contamination.



  The prefabricated sections of casing are connected with a bolted connection for
  speed. Each section will be rotated or oscillated into the ground and as the casing is
  installed additional sections will be bolted onto the top of the installed section until
  the desired depth is achieved. If the hole is not dry then concrete plug will be placed
  by tremie to the bottom of the hole to seal the casing. The casing will be dewatered
  and water will need to be captured and monitored for contamination. When the
casing is dewatered the full length rebar cage will be installed and concrete will be
placed. When the casing is set to designed grade, the drill operation will commence
with the next pier casing while the rebar cage is set and concrete is placed in the 1 st
casing, this sequence will continue till all piers are completed.


   Schedule: We estimate drilling and construction of the 10 drilled shafts will take 5
   weeks. This will probably be a two shift operation due to being performed during
   the power outage window.

   Equipment:
                 1.     Large Crane mounted with a drilling attachment;
                 2.     Large Crane for handling of casings and rebar cage;
                 3.     Concrete trucks/Concrete Pump for concrete placement;
                 4.     Forklift for material handling;
                 5.     Welder for casings.

8.2 Pier Columns at Piers 2, 3, and 4: (Power Outage and IWWW) - Following
behind the shaft construction will be construction of the columns at Piers 2, 3, and 4
(6 total for West Bridge).

   Schedule: Estimated at 4 weeks – 2 shifts

   Equipment:
      1. Small Crane for setting forms and handling rebar;
      2. Forklift to get materials to crane;
      3. Welder if using steel forms;
      4. Concrete Pump for placement of concrete;
      5. Concrete Trucks for delivery of concrete.


8.3 Crossbeams: (Power Outage only) – This operation follows behind columns at
Piers 2, 3, 4.

   Schedule: Estimated to take 3 weeks – 2 shifts

   Equipment:
      1. Crane for setting forms and handling rebar;
      2. Forklift to get materials to crane;
      3. Concrete Pump for placement of concrete;
      4. Concrete Trucks for delivery of concrete.
   8.4 Abutments: Pier 1 and Pier 5: (Power Outage only) - Follows behind the
   drilled shafts at Pier 1 and Pier 5. Precast girders will set on top of abutment wall.




9.0 West Bridge Superstructure

   9.1 Remove Work Bridge Superstructure: (Power Outage only) - Work Bridge
   superstructure would be removed in sections immediately prior to setting precast girders.

   Several spans of the work trestle superstructure will be removed to clear the span needed
   for precast girder erection. Once a span of the permanent bridge is cleared, the precast
   girders for that span can be set.

      NOTE:
              Fairview Ave will be closed to traffic during this night time operation.
              One crane will be positioned on the work trestle during the girder erection.
              A second crane will be positioned on the existing, strengthened East Bridge

   The work bridge drilled shafts would be removed at a later date which will require only an
   IWWW.. The work bridge removal could be done on day shift and girders set on night shift

   9.2 Set Girders (24 girders – 6 each span – 4 spans): (Power Outage Window
   only) – Prior to setting girders, the East Bridge would be strengthened, as required,
   to support a crane capable lifting and setting one end of a girder. This operation will
   require a full traffic closure most likely on a night time shifts.

   Upon completion of setting the precast girders, the extended IWWW will no longer be
   required in the Spring of 2015. Remaining in-water-work can be performed during the next
   window on October 1, 2015 to April 15, 2016.

      Schedule: Estimated at 3 weeks – 2 shifts (includes work bridge removal).

      Equipment:
         1. 2 large cranes to handle girders (maybe one really large crane?);
         2. Semi-Tractor/Trailer for delivery of girders;
         3. Semi-Tractor/Trailer for removal of work bridge materials;
         4. Forklift for material handling
9.3 Roadway Deck: (No work windows needed) - After Girders are set the
roadway deck work will commence. A plywood containment deck will be placed on
the bottom flange of the precast girders to contain any material that may be dropped
as well as concrete leakage. Concrete deck formwork will be placed on the
underside of the top flange of the girders to support the deck reinforcing steel,
imbeds, and concrete during placement. Work will proceed span to span until
completed.
   Schedule: Estimated to take 6 weeks (would be good work to 2 shifts).

   Equipment:
      1. Crane to handle rebar and form materials
      2. Forklift for material handling

9.4 Place Roadway Deck: (No work windows needed) - After completion of
roadway deck forming, rebar placed and embeds installed, the roadway deck
concrete is placed. This could be done in sections however this will depend on the
expansion joint layout

   Schedule: Estimated to take 1 week for placement and 1 week for cure

   Equipment:
      1. Concrete Pump or line pump
      2. Concrete Trucks
      3. Concrete Finishing Machine (Bidwell).

9.5 Deck Improvements : (No work windows needed) - (barrier, railing, lights,
striping, and ACP pavement at bridge ends): This work is all the work above the
roadway deck that is required to get ready for the traffic switch onto the new West
Bridge from the existing East Bridge. Bridge rails, Light poles and wiring, installation

INTRODUCTION

In compliance with the Presidential Executive Order 12898 and DOT Order 5610.2, an Environmental
Justice (EJ) Analysis was conducted for the Fairview Avenue North Bridge Replacement Project. Title VI
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Restoration Act mandate that all agencies receiving
federal funding must ensure non-discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in all of their
programs and activities. Title VI also requires consideration of the effects of projects on people with
limited-English proficiency (LEP) to avoid discrimination based on national origin. Presidential Executive
Order 13166 requires improved access to federally funded activities for persons with limited-English
proficiency. Similarly, Executive Order 12898 (1994) requires federal agencies to analyze their actions
and environmental impacts on minority and low-income populations.

Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT) Environmental Procedures Manual
(WSDOT 2013) and The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) online Environmental
Justice resources were used to guide the analysis for the Fairview Avenue North Bridge Replacement
Project. As outlined in WSDOT’s demographic data collection standards, a 0.5 mile radius around the
project site was used as the demographic area of analysis. This report documents the extent of minority,
low income, and LEP residents within the study area, as well as the public outreach efforts that have and
will be conducted in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The City of Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) proposes to replace two existing bridges on
Fairview Avenue North along the southeast shoreline of Lake Union, in Seattle, King County,
Washington (see Figure 1). The existing bridges consist of an East and a West Bridge that were built in
1948 and 1963, respectively. Based on a December 2012 inspection report, both bridges are
structurally deficient.

A Type, Size, and Location study analyzed various project construction options and recommended the
complete replacement of the East Bridge and West Bridge with a single new multispan bridge (HNTB
and Perteet, 2013). SDOT’s proposed bridge replacement is to construct a 540-foot long, 67-foot wide
structure comprised of four 135-foot long spans constructed between new abutments located on either
end of the new bridge. The new four span bridge will be supported on bents of four foot diameter
reinforced concrete bridge columns, constructed on a foundation of eight foot diameter drilled shafts
that will be installed to an approximate depth of 130 feet. The 67-foot wide structure is necessary to
accommodate the new roadway section, which includes two northbound travel lanes, one southbound
travel lane, a two-way cycle track, and sidewalks along the east and west side of the bridge. The number
of travel lanes for the proposed structure is the same as the existing condition. The existing section
also includes the addition of a mixed use trail/sidewalk and cycle track along the western side of the
bridge.

The new mixed use trail/sidewalk and cycle track will provide connectivity for the Cheshiahud Lake
Union Loop trail within the project corridor that will replace existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities
that do not meet current design standards.

There is no sidewalk on the western side of the existing bridge. A floating walkway attached to the
bridge currently provides north-south pedestrian access through the project corridor. In addition, the
floating walkway provides public shoreline and water access to Lake Union. Following construction, the
new multi-use sidewalk and cycle track constructed on the bridge will provide north-south pedestrian
and bicycle access through the project corridor. The City plans to replace the floating walkway or
provide a similar facility to provide public shoreline and water access within the project area following
construction of the new bridge. The City’s intent is to relocate and reuse components of the existing
walkway, but the final configuration of the facility will be determined during final design based on federal,
state, and local permit conditions. Unless precluded by permit conditions, the relocated floating
walkway or other water access facility will be anchored to steel pipe piles, which will be vibrated into
place, adjacent to the new bridge within existing City right of way.

The Fairview Avenue North Bridge Replacement project is being funded in two ways: Bridging the Gap,
a nine-year levy for transportation maintenance and improvement, and federal funding through the
Bridge Replacement Advisory Committee (BRAC).

POPULATION AND STUDY AREA DEMOGRAPHICS

To comply with WSDOT’s environmental justice demographic data collection methods (WSDOT 2012),
two sources of data were used to gather demographic data for this analysis:

        US Census Bureau. The 2010 Census and 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) Data
        (2006 – 2010 average) serve as the primary data sources for this analysis. EPA’s EJView online
        mapping tool was used to generate the Census 2010 Summary Report (Appendix A) and the
        ACS Summary Report (Appendix B). These data are reported for census blocks within a 0.5
        mile radius of the project centerline (see Figure 3), and provide a summary of representative
        populations in the project vicinity.

        Washington State Report Card, Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public
        Instruction. This online database serves as the secondary source of data for this analysis. As
        outlined in TSK 458-b Demographic Data Collection: For a Social Analysis and to Determine if an EJ
        Population Exists (WSDOT 2012), school enrollment data from the nearest elementary school
        was gathered and used to verify US Census and ACS data. The nearest elementary school to the
        project site is Seattle Public School’s Lowell Elementary School, located approximately one mile
        from the Fairview Avenue North Bridge, at 1058 East Mercer Street, in the Capitol Hill
        neighborhood of Seattle.

Table 1 summarizes the “Population by Race” 2010 Census Data, reported at the census block level for
the area within 0.5 mile of the centerline of the project, as well as the Student Demographic data for
Lowell Elementary School’s student enrollment, as reported in October 2012. According to the data
gathered, Lowell Elementary School indicates a higher percentage of minority students than represented
Environmental Justice and Title VI of the                                                      October 2014

Fairview Avenue North Bridge


within the US Census and ACS data. This variance in data can be explained largely by different
boundaries in areas of analysis, as illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the study area boundary and
Lowell Elementary School's attendance area. These areas of analysis span different neighborhoods within
the City which have varying demographic and socio-economic populations. An additional reason the
Washington State Report Card data differs from the US Census Bureau data may be due to the different
years of data collection.

*The total population also includes a small percentage of people who reported their race as “Two or More Races”
therefore an individual could be represented in more than one ethnicity. Therefore, the total percentages may not
add up to 100 percent.
**The US Census Bureau reports the Hispanic population as a separate and distinct category and may include
other races. Consequently, the population numbers may be double-counted within other reported races.


The 2010 ACS data shows that 14 percent of the households in the Census block groups that are within
0.5 mile of the project alignment are reported as being low-income. Low-income status is determined
by the poverty threshold, which is set annually by the US Department of Health and Human Services.
The 2013 poverty level for a 4-person household is $23,550.

Another method of determining income level is reviewing the number of students participating in the
free or reduced-price meals program. Seattle Public School District reported that 51 percent of Lowell
Elementary School students participated in the free or reduced-price meals program. To qualify for this
school program, a family of four must earn $42,643 or less annually, as set by the 2012 USDA Income
Eligibility Guidelines.

2010 Census data were collected for the study area census block groups to determine the English-
speaking ability of populations within the study area. “Population by Ability to Speak English” 2010
Census data reveals that 3 percent of the populations within the census block groups that are within 0.5
mile of the project alignment speak English “less than well.” The Seattle Public School data reports 2
students, or 0.9 percent, that are transitional bilingual students. WSDOT outlines a 5 percent threshold
value to determine when language translation is required. While none of the limited English proficient
language groups exceed this threshold, the Inclusive Outreach and Public Engagement Plan identifies that
some of the outreach material will be translated into Spanish (SDOT 2013).

Public Involvement and Outreach – Title VI Compliance

SDOT has developed an Inclusive Outreach and Public Engagement Plan (IOPE) (SDOT 2013) to help
guide the project staff through the public involvement process, striving for multiculturalism and
providing equal access and respect for all populations affected by this project. This plan outlines the
following goals:

             Raise the public’s awareness about the project and gather input during the project’s design
              phase.
             Engage the communities affected by the project in a meaningful way by including them in
              decision making and promoting a sense of ownership.
             Ensure an open and transparent public involvement process.
             Minimize potential impacts to drivers, pedestrians, transit users, bicyclists, major
              institutions, businesses, adjacent neighbors and communities through strategic design and
              construction of the project.
             Create a project record of public input, responses, and outreach activities.

In order to meet these goals, the following outreach activities and various media sources have been
identified to engage the public in this project:
          Open Houses
            Briefings
            Fairs and Festivals
            Traditional and Social Media
            Ethnic Media
            Use of interpreters
            Spanish language translation

In order to meet these goals, the following outreach activities and various media sources have been
identified to engage the public in this project:
          Open Houses
            Briefings
            Fairs and Festivals
            Traditional and Social Media
            Ethnic Media
            Use of interpreters
            Spanish language translation
A broad and overly-inclusive area of analysis surrounding the project site area was used to gather data
and determine outreach goals and activities. No specific distance or geographic requirements were
followed for data collection. The project team has conducted a total of 11 briefings so far including 3
city advisory boards, 6 neighboring business/business groups, and 2 neighborhood groups. The project
team is in ongoing communication with government agencies including Seattle City Light and King
County Metro. Future meetings are anticipated with the Seattle Design Commission as well as other
businesses and community groups neighboring the project. The City has also created an informational
website to provide for additional outreach for the bridge replacement project. The website includes a
project background, overview, schedule, fact sheet, and contact information
(http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/fairviewbridge.htm).



Project Effects

The Fairview Avenue North Bridge Replacement project is located in a developed urban area with
commercial, industrial, and residential uses surrounding the project site. No acquisitions, relocations,
nor permanent changes to transportation nor access are associated with this project. Parking impacts
will result in a permanent reduction of less than 3 percent of the existing parking spaces in the project
area. The temporary increase of noise and dust occur during the active construction time frame. No
impact pile driving will occur during construction to reduce the noise levels as much as possible. During
the anticipated 24-month construction phase, pedestrian, vehicle, and public transportation routes will
be maintained with temporary detours on a parallel route one block east, along Eastlake Avenue East.
There will be no permanent impacts to traffic or public transportation. The bridge replacement will
include a new roadway configuration to better accommodate all users making it safer for people to
drive, walk, bike, and access transit along Fairview Avenue North.


Determination

There will be no disproportionate impacts to Environmental Justice populations as a result of this
project. No minority, low-income populations, nor Environmental Justice Communities have been
identified to be adversely affected by this project as determined above. Therefore, this project has met
the provisions of Executive Order 12898, as it is supported by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

Data Note: Detail may not sum to totals dues to rounding. Hispanic population can be of any race. N/A means not avialable.
2006-2010 ACS 5-year Estimates: The American Community Survey (ACS) summary files provide nation-wide population and housing characteristic data at all
Census summary levels down to the Block Group level. This data was collected between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010. ACS replaces the decennial
census sample data, and is not the 2010 Census population counts data. (http://www.census.gov/acs/www/#fragment-3)
Margin of error (MOE): The MOE provides a measure of the uncertainty in the estimate due to sampling error in the ACS survey. Applying the MOE value yields
the confidence interval for the estimate. For example, an estimate value of 50 and +/- MOE of 5 means the true value is between 45 and 55 with a 90 percenet
certainty (http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/Accuracy/MultiyearACSAccuracyofData2010.pdf). Maximum MOE is shown for each
value within study area.

Introduction
This Navigation Evaluation was prepared as an attachment to United States Coast Guard
(USCG) Bridge Permit Applications for the Fairview Avenue North Bridge (FANB)
Replacement Project. This project involves removal of the existing twin parallel bridges along
Fairview Avenue North and construction of a replacement bridge in the original location. The
adjacent floating walkway will be removed during construction and reinstalled, approximately
ten feet northwest of its current location, once the replacement bridge is complete. The former
fuel dock that remains in the center of the waterway will be permanently removed, along with
the remaining freestanding dolphins and pilings.

Waterway Layout and Geometry
The FANB spans the foot of a dead-end waterway in the southeast corner of Lake Union, known
as Waterway 8.

The waterway is rectangular in shape, measuring roughly 850 feet long and 400 feet wide, and
aligned northwest to southeast (~310°/130°). The water level in the Lake is managed by the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and maintained between +20.0 and +22.00 feet above Mean
Lower Low Water (MLLW). There is no perceptible current in the area. At Low Water of the
Lake (+20.0 feet above MLLW), Waterway 8 is approximately 35 feet deep at its entrance and
20 feet deep at the edge of the bridge and 0 to 5 feet deep at its end at the side of the historic
steam plant building It has no designated navigation channel.

It is flanked on the northeast side by a wooden mooring pier extending more than 900 feet from
shore, which is the defining feature of the waterway. The southwest side is bounded by a
commercial waterfront lot, and a wooden float that marks one end of a recreational boat marina.
The outermost point of the float lies ~360 feet from shore and ~600 feet from Fairview Avenue.
A dilapidated wooden pier runs down the center of the waterway, extending roughly 195 feet to

the northwest from an area near the base of the bridge. Scattered across the end of the waterway
are a number of old wooden dolphins and broken/submerged pilings that pose a hazard to
navigation.

The bridge spans the waterway’s endpoint, running ~040°/220°, perpendicular to the northwest-
southeast alignment of the waterway. The trestle is impassable for vessels, and no navigable
waters lie further to the southeast. The bridge sits directly in front of the historic Lake Union
Steam Plant building and one other commercial property.

Historical/Navigational Background
The first bridge trestle at this location was constructed prior to 1923. The record drawings of the
trestle constructed in 1923 show an existing trestle on the east side of the 1923 trestle. The pre-
1923 bridge trestle effectively restricted all navigation beneath or east of the bridge deck.
Navigational access beneath the bridge has not been restored or improved since that time.

For many years after the first trestle was in place, the adjacent Lake Union Steam Plant was
supplied with fuel-oil by barge. Barges would moor and offload at the wooden pier that still
bisects the waterway. Fuel-oil was transferred to the Steam Plant via pipe runs passing beneath
the bridge deck (see Figure 5). Barge traffic ceased in 1947 when an upland tank was installed

to supply fuel-oil to the Steam Plant. The “fuel dock,” as it was known, is now dilapidated and
unusable.
Currently FANB consists of two side-by-side bridges, the West Bridge and the East Bridge, that
span Waterway 8 at its end adjacent to the Steam Plant Building. The existing West Bridge
trestle was constructed in 1948 , replacing the 1923 trestle, again with no navigational access
under or east of the bridge deck. In 1964, the existing East Bridge was constructed between the
West Bridge Trestle and the Steam Plant Building. In 1993, the adjacent floating walkway was
built and dedicated to public use by Zymogenetics, as part of its redevelopment of the Steam
Plant building. The walkway offers a water-level walking alternative to the Fairview Avenue
trestle; and an attached concrete float provides access to Lake Union for kayaks and other small
craft.
Today, the West and East Bridges are completely enclosed on the west side by chain-link
fencing, except for a locked passageway for foot traffic from the former “Hydro House,”
adjacent to the Steam Plant building.




Figure 6   Present-day photo of FANB and the adjoining floating walkway.

There has been no navigational access beneath the FANB since the original trestle was built
prior to 1923, more than 92 years ago. There is no reasonable need for navigation under the
bridge presently, and no foreseeable need in the future.
The historic Steam Plant building, now owned by Zymogenetics, has been converted into a
biotechnical/pharmaceutical research facility, which has no navigational needs. The adjacent
property, The Gunn Building at 1165 Eastlake Avenue E, is in the permitting phase for a
significant remodeling/expansion project, also for a proposed biotechnology research facility
(Reference 1). Furthermore, recent Seattle Department of Planning and Development (DPD)
interpretation (#05-001) determined that this property will be considered an upland lot and not a
waterfront lot (Reference 2). As such, it has no direct shoreline access for water dependent uses.
