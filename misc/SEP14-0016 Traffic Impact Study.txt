SUBJECT:    Traffic and Parking Impact Analysis of the Promenade Apartments
            TENW Project No. 3314

This memorandum summarizes a traffic impact analysis of the proposed Promenade Apartments, a mixed-
use project containing a proposed 294 residential units and a 10,350 square foot building for
retail/commercial uses in Auburn, WA. This memo includes a project description, a description of existing
transportation conditions within the immediate site vicinity, methodology used to derive the trip generation
estimate, traffic operational analysis of the key site access intersection and key off-site intersections under
cumulative impacts, a summary of Auburn parking code requirements, and identification of any
transportation mitigation measures to offset traffic impacts.

Project Description
The proposed Promenade Apartments project includes buildout of a 14.5-acre site north of SE 312th Street
and east of 124th Avenue SE that currently consists of six single-family houses. The mixed-use development
proposes a combination of apartment units and commercial uses, consistent with the underlying zoning. The
apartment development would consist of up to 294 units with a recreational building and a separate
10,350 square foot separate retail/commercial building. A project site vicinity map is shown in Figure 1.
For the purposes of this analysis, a 2017 horizon was used to evaluate cumulative traffic impacts.

A site plan is illustrated in Figure 2. Vehicular site access for the residential portion of the project is
proposed via one access roadway onto SE 312th St; opposing the existing SE 312th Way intersection. As
part of the project, the existing two-way left turning lane west of the site would be extended to the
residential access driveway intersection where it would transition into a dedicated left turn only lane. A
total of 586 on-site parking stalls would be provided. A secondary fire/emergency vehicle access
roadway that connects to a new 130th Avenue SE cul-de-sac would also be constructed to serve the
residential apartment units. At the request of the City of Auburn, an alternative access plan that includes a
full public access and extension of 130th Avenue SE between its existing terminus to SE 312th Street was
also evaluated for the residential portion of the project.

Access to the commercial building would be via a separate commercial driveway onto SE 312th Street
given the presence of an existing stream/wetland area that impacts cross circulation on-site. A two-way
center left-turning lane would also be provided at this commercial driveway location. For the purposes of
the traffic and parking impact analysis, a YMCA Daycare Center has been assumed as a worst-case
scenario as this specific use generates the highest number of trips among potential commercial uses under
consideration by the applicant.

Existing Transportation Conditions
This section includes an inventory of existing roadway conditions, key intersections in the site vicinity and
traffic volumes, levels of service, and planned roadway improvements.


Roadway Conditions

The following paragraphs describe existing arterial roadways that would be used for site access. Roadway
characteristics are described in terms of number of lanes, posted speed limits, shoulder types and widths.

SR 18 is a 4 lane, divided freeway with an average daily traffic volume of 48,000 vehicles (WSDOT
Annual Traffic Report, 2012). Near SE 304th Street, SR 18 is a four lane (two lanes in each direction),
divided freeway with a 40 foot asphalt median and 12 foot asphalt lanes. The westbound lanes have 10
foot and 6 foot asphalt shoulders while the eastbound lanes have 10 foot and 4 foot asphalt shoulders. The
posted speed is 60 mph (WSDOT State Highway Log, 2012).

SE 312th Street is an east-west minor arterial ranging in width from 2 to 3 lanes. Travel lanes are
approximately 11 feet wide, with curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and bike lanes provided on both sides of the
street west of the project site. A two-way, center left turn lane is provided west of the project site.

SE 304th Street is a 2-lane roadway with a traveled way of approximately 21 feet and 3-4 foot paved
shoulders. West of 144th Avenue SE, the roadway widens to provide separate turn lanes at the SR 18
ramp junctions. Gravel/earthen shoulders beyond paving limits are also provided in various widths on the
north side of the roadway. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

132nd Avenue SE is a two-lane principal arterial with 11- to 12-foot wide travel lanes and 7- to 9-foot
paved shoulders. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

124th Avenue SE is a north-south minor arterial consisting of two travel lanes 10 to 12 feet wide with 4- to
6-foot paved shoulders. Bicycle lanes are provided north of SE 314th Street. A two-way, center left-turn
lane is provided between just north of SE 312th Street and halfway to SE 304th Street. The speed limit is
posted at 35 mph.

105th Place SE is a two-lane, north-south roadway with 11-foot travel lanes and 4-foot paved shoulders.
The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

Traffic Counts
Peak hour traffic volumes represent the highest hourly volume of vehicles passing through an intersection
during a typical 7-9 a.m. or 4-6 p.m. weekday peak period. Historical p.m. peak period turning
movement counts at study intersections were conducted during peak utilization periods of the vicinity Green
River Community College (GRCC) campus during Fall quarter 2013 by TENW, and supplemented by
traffic counts collected in March 2014 by the City of Auburn, and in March 2014/2015 by iDax Data
Solutions. Given the distribution of traffic and total project trips, 10 separate off-site intersections were
determined to warrant review. Figure 3 and Figure 4 summarize the existing p.m. peak period turning
movements at the study intersections. Where count discrepancies were found, the higher traffic counts were
utilized and all counts rounded to the nearest 5 vehicles. Attachment 1 includes 2014 traffic counts.

Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection level of service (LOS) analyses were conducted at the study intersections during the weekday
PM peak hour of existing conditions and with project traffic generated at full buildout of the Promenade
Apartments project. LOS refers to the degree of congestion on a roadway or intersection. It is a measure
of vehicle operating speed, travel time, travel delays, and driving comfort. A letter scale from A to F
generally describes LOS.

At signalized intersections, LOS A represents free-flow conditions-motorists experience little or no delays,
and LOS F represents forced-flow conditions-motorists experience an average delay in excess of 80
seconds per vehicle. The LOS reported for signalized intersections represents the average control delay per
vehicle entering the intersection. The LOS reported at stop-controlled intersections is also based on the
average control delay (sec/veh) and is reported for each movement. Therefore, the reported LOS at
unsignalized intersections does not represent a measure of the overall operations of the intersection.

LOS calculations for both signalized and stop-controlled intersections were calculated using the
methodologies and procedures outlined in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Special Report
209, Transportation Research Board (TRB). Table 1 outlines the LOS criteria for signalized and
unsignalized intersections based on these methodologies.

Intersection LOS were calculated using the methodology and procedures outlined in the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM), Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board (TRB), using the Synchro 8
software program. Existing a.m. peak hour are summarized in Table 2 and existing p.m. peak hour LOS
analyses are summarized in Table 3. As shown, all intersections or critical movements would operate at
LOS D or better in 2014. The City of Auburn maintains a level of service standard of LOS D for its arterial
intersections.

Detailed LOS summary worksheets are included in Attachment 2.

Planned Transportation Improvements
The WSDOT State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), King County Capital Improvement Program,
and City of Auburn 2014-2019 Transportation Improvement Program were reviewed for planned
transportation improvements that would provide increased traffic capacity for future growth within the
immediate vicinity of the site. While there are planned pedestrian improvements along SE 312th St and
124th Avenue SE corridors, and intersection and bike lane improvements along 116th Ave SE, no capacity
improvements are currently planned for construction within the horizon year.

Traffic Impact Analysis
The following section describes projected future baseline traffic growth, new trips generated by the proposed
development, distribution and assignment of new project trips, intersection level of service impacts, site
access, safety and circulation issues, and identification of transportation mitigation to offset impacts.

2017 Baseline Traffic Volumes
To evaluate project traffic impact at full buildout, a review was conducted of available historical traffic counts
and recent traffic counts conducted by TENW in the site vicinity. Based on this review, a background traffic
growth rate of 1 percent per year was applied to existing traffic volumes. Additional traffic generated by
known pipeline development was included in the forecasts for the new Trades Complex and Student Life
Building at Green River Community College, the 4-lot Gian short plat and 12-lot subdivision for Willow on
130th Avenue SE immediately north of the project. Attachment 3 summarizes existing, pipeline, baseline,
and with project forecast assumptions at each study intersection.

Project Trip Generation
Trip generation rates compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition,
2012, were used to estimate p.m. peak hour traffic that would be generated by the proposed action.
Fitted curve equations Apartments (ITE Land Use Code 220) and Day Care Center (Land Use Code 565)
were used to estimate new trips generated by the proposed development under a worse-case scenario (i.e.,
the highest trip generator of any potential commercial/retail use at the project site). For the purposes of the
traffic analysis, up to 320 residential apartment units have been assumed, and no discounts were taken for
existing residential uses that are expected use by the applicant of approximately 50 percent of all daycare
students (under this worse-case scenario) to be generated by on-site residents and those of the adjacent
Seasons complex. Table 4 summarizes estimated trip generation by the proposed action. An estimated net
increase of 287 a.m. peak hour vehicular trips (99 entering and 189 exiting) and 322 p.m. peak hour
vehicular trips (186 entering and 136 exiting) was assumed for traffic impacts at full build-out of the project.
Attachment 4 provides a detailed summary of trip generation estimates.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
To distribute trips onto the vicinity-street and arterial network, trip distribution patterns were determined
based on review of existing travel patterns, and the relative distribution of schools, employment centers, and
residential density in the vicinity. Generally, average distribution and assignment of project trips were:
      15 percent north and 20 percent south via 124th Ave SE;
     5 percent north via 132nd Ave SE;
     30 percent west via 312th Ave SE; and
     10 percent west / 20 percent east via SR 18

Figure 5 illustrates trip distribution and the project-generated trip assignments during the p.m. peak hour at
the study intersections the 2017 horizon year. Figures 6 and 7 summarize project trips of the proposed
Promenade Apartments project in 2017 during the a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour, respectively.

Intersection Level of Service Impacts
Table 5 and Table 6 summarize a.m. and p.m. level of service impacts in 2017 assuming full buildout of
the proposed Promenade Apartments project. Figure 8 and Figure 9 summarize traffic volume impacts of
the proposed Promenade project during the a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour in 2017. As shown, all
study intersections are projected to operate at LOS D or better with or without the project, including the
main site access intersection of SE 312th Street and SE 312th Way/Site Access.

Connection to 130th Avenue SE

The City of Auburn required an evaluation of an additional connection roadway from the northern end of
the project site to 130th Avenue SE. Trips were redistributed accordingly and a traffic analysis was
conducted based on this connection roadway. Only intersections 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 would be
affected by this additional access; thus, only those intersections warranted further review. It should be
noted, that total existing demand for traffic volumes entering/exiting the residential neighborhood
immediately north of the project that have turning movements south or west of the study area only total
approximately 62 a.m. peak hour trips and 65 pm peak hour trips at study intersections 8 and 9.
Additional a.m. and p.m. peak hour counts were also conducted at local neighborhood streets onto SE
304th Street via 127th Avenue SE and 128th Avenue SE to evaluate the potential for the entire residential
draw area south of SE 304th Street and west of 132 Avenue SE (see 2015 counts in Attachment 7).

Of existing trips that would represent those as a potential for reassignment, all trips to/from the south
observed via SE 308th Street, roughly a third of all trips via 130th Avenue SE at SE 304th Street to/from the
west, and 20 percent of all traffic via the 127th Avenue SE and 128th Avenue SE neighborhood streets
to/from the west were assumed to be redistributed onto an assumed 130th Avenue SE connection south to
SE 312th Street. Under these redistribution assumptions, nearly 50 percent of all vehicle trips of
neighborhood traffic currently being generated at study intersections 8 and 9 would be reassigned.
Existing trips reassigned to 130th Avenue SE through the site included 29 exiting/12 entering during the
a.m. peak hour and 12 exiting/28 entering during the p.m. peak hour. Pipeline developments within this
residential neighborhood are expected to add an additional 2 a.m. peak hour vehicle trips and 3 p.m.
peak hour vehicle trips to this redistribution of traffic volumes onto a roadway connection through the
proposed development site, a cumulative total of 43 a.m. peak hour trips and 42 p.m. peak hour trips.

Cumulatively, the addition of project trips and redistribution of existing/pipeline trips with the 130th Avenue
SE connection would increase total traffic volumes on 130th Avenue SE, with a net increase of
approximately 19 a.m. peak hour trips and 15 p.m. peak hour trips with the project and the „through‰
connection south to SE 312th Street measured at the SE 304th Street intersection. South of SE 308th Street
on 130th Avenue SE this increase would be moderately higher compared to existing traffic volumes along
this roadway segment. Changes in distribution of trips and project traffic impacts at off-site impacts
however, remain insignificant given the relative levels of peak hour project volumes or redistribution of other
non-project volumes as a result of the 130th Avenue SE extension. Figures 10 and 11 summarize project
trip distribution and redistribution of non-project volumes during the a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour,
respectively.

Table 7 summarizes the a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour LOS analyses at full buildout with the 130th
Avenue SE connection. As shown, all intersections or critical movements would operate at LOS D or better
in 2017. As there would be no substantial difference in off-site traffic impacts or level of service operations
as a result of the 130th Avenue SE extension, there is no basis under SEPA or City code/engineering
standards to require the applicant to construct a new public roadway through the site.

Roadway Level of Service Impacts

Tables 8 and 9 summarize 2017 roadway level of service impacts during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours
on roadway segments of 124th Avenue SE, 132nd Avenue SE, SE 304th Street, and SE 312th Street.
Signalized intersections were assumed at arterial endpoints in order to obtain arterial levels of service. As
shown, each roadway section would operate at LOS C or better with or without the project during the
a.m. and p.m. peak hour in 2017, meeting City adopted standards. Roadway level of service analysis is
in Attachment 5. It should be noted that SE 320th Street was excluded from the roadway level of service
analysis as it does not contain any study intersections.

Auburn Code Parking Requirements
Auburn Municipal Code (AMC) 18.52.020 Off-Street Parking Requirements by Land Use identifies
minimum off-street parking requirements for the proposed multifamily residential and retail commercial uses.
A total of 586 stalls are proposed on-site, 528 to serve residential apartments and 58 for the proposed
commercial building. Table 10 summarizes minimum off-street parking stalls required. As shown, the City
of Auburn would require 528 off-street parking stalls for uses for the proposed apartment use and 528 stalls
would be provided, meeting City code. For the proposed commercial building, code review of several
different land uses were considered and the worst-case for parking demand was found to be medical
office. For medical office uses, 52 stalls would be required under City code and 58 stalls would be
provided, also meeting City code. As such, no off-site parking impacts would occur and more parking
would be provided on-site than required by City code.

Site Access and Safety Issues
Vehicular site access is proposed via one access roadway onto SE 312th Street. There are no adjacent or
opposing driveways within the immediate vicinity of the proposed full access driveway locations. The
proposed residential site driveway is located opposite SE 312th Way. Under current conditions, entering
sight distance at SE 312th Street east of the site access does not meet Auburn standards of for the design
speed of 45 mph. The proposed interior roadways within the development would provide adequate fire
and emergency vehicle access to the proposed residential subdivision.

Per City Code, the applicant would be required to construct the necessary site access roadways and
frontage improvements along SE 312th Street, which could also include right-of-way dedication. As part of
the project, existing center two-way left turn lane along the project frontage through to the proposed main
residential entry were it would transition to a one-way left turning lane at the SE 312th Way intersection.

School Safe Walk Route Analysis

As part of the proposed Promenade Apartments project, a new sidewalk would be constructed along the
SE 312th Street frontage. In addition, an interior separated sidewalk/trail system between the residential
apartments and on-site daycare facility would be constructed. Raised and separated sidewalks between
both the residential and commercial portions of the project would be constructed between on-site uses and
the public sidewalk system. As the adjacent apartment complex (The Seasons), was developed and is
owned and maintained by the same applicant, DevCo, Inc., a pedestrian easement or designated walk
route between the SE 312th Street public sidewalk and the interior sidewalk system within The Seasons that
provides a pedestrian link directly to the Lea Hill Elementary School (separated from arterial traffic) can be
established to serve as the designated „safe walk route‰ for children to the adjacent elementary school.
Two separate routes within The Seasons complex are shown in Attachment 6.

Project Mitigation
A review of traffic impacts to intersection levels of service, site access, and circulation issues was conducted
in association with the Promenade Apartments project, a planned 294-unit residential development and
10,350 square foot commercial retail/commercial building in Auburn, WA. The following mitigation
measures are recommended to reduce or eliminate project impacts:
     The applicant would be required to construct the necessary site access roadway and frontage
      improvements along SE 312th Street, including construction of a cul-de-sac on 130th Avenue SE.
     The results of the traffic operations analysis show that all the study intersections are expected to
      operate at acceptable levels with the proposed development and site access improvements
      proposed along SE 312th Street.
     To mitigate systemwide impacts in the City of Auburn, traffic impact fees are collected towards
      capacity improvements that serve new development. Based on impact fees effective January
      2015, the estimated total traffic impact fee for the entire site buildout would be payable at the time
      of building permit is estimated as:
                         294 Apartments X $2,237.30 = $657,766.2
                         10,350 square foot Daycare X $18.05/SF = $186,817.50
                         Removal of 6 Single-Family Homes X $3,413.48 = - $20,480.88
                         Total Fee = $ 824,102.82
     The results of sight distance analysis show that the entering sight distance at SE 312th Street east of
      the project entrance does not meet Auburn standards. In order to provide adequate entering sight
      distance at SE 312th Street, a retaining wall must be constructed to the south of the project site,
      east of the entrance. This sight distance issue has been addressed in the development of the
      project site plan.
     Provide a cross access pedestrian easement for a designated school safe walk route through the
      adjacent The Seasons complex.
