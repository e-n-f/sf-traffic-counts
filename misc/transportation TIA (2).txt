                                       Introduction
This report identifies potential transportation-related impacts associated with the proposed
development and to identify appropriate measures to mitigate identified project impacts, as
necessary. The following analysis has been carried out in accordance with the State
Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).
This report first documents the existing study area characteristics, including the surrounding
roadway network, traffic volumes, traffic safety, and non-motorized facilities. Future 2027
without-project (Baseline) conditions were analyzed to provide a basis for evaluating project
impacts. Project-generated traffic was added to future baseline conditions to form the basis of
the future with-project conditions. Finally, mitigation measures to offset potential project
impacts were determined, as necessary.


Project Description
The University Village Shopping Center is located in Seattle, Washington. The property is
bound on the south by NE 45th street, on the north by NE 49th Street, on the west by 25th
Avenue NE, and on the east by the QFC property. Six major entry points serve University
Village; three of these are along 25th Avenue NE, two are along NE 45th Street, and one is
along 30th Avenue NE/Union Bay Place NE.

The shopping center currently inludes approximately 512,600 square feet of leasable retail
space. The site vicinity is shown in Figure 1.
The proposed project would include the following key elements:
    1. Construction of a 733-stall parking garage on the northwest corner of the site. Access
       to the garage will utilize the existing signalized access on 25th Avenue as well as a
       secondary access from the garage to the north along NE 49th Street. This parking
       garage would remove existing surface parking resulting in a net increase of up to 416
       stalls. The garage may be constructed in phases as the additional retail identified in
       this analysis is permitted and the existing and future parking demands are verified.
    2. Construction of up to 100,000 sf of additional retail/commercial leasable area.
    3. Elimination of internal vehicle connections on the north end of the Village.

The anticipated completion of this expansion is 2027. A conceptual site plan showing the
area of the proposed retail expansion and changes in on-site circulation and parking supply is
included as Figure 2.


Study Scope
The transportation analysis scope and approach were based on coordination with City of
Seattle staff as well as previous University Village reports. The following study intersections,
represent locations within the project vicinity that would experience the greatest impact as a
result of project traffic and thus were included in this impact analysis:

Typically, mall and shopping center-type land uses generate more project trips during the
Saturday mid-day peak than during the weekday PM peak. In previous studies, a screenline
analysis of existing volumes adjacent to the site was conducted to determine whether the
Saturday peak hour should be analyzed in addition to the weekday peak hour. The two-time
periods were compared and the weekday peak screenline volumes were observed to be
higher than during the Saturday peak on roadways surrounding University Village.

For consistency, the same screenline analysis was conducted for this current analysis.
Similar to the previously performed analysis, the weekday peak hour was shown to be
roughly 19 percent higher than the Saturday peak hour for surrounding street traffic. There is
one screenline location where traffic was less than 5 vehicles smaller during the weekday
peak hour than during the Saturday peak hour. This difference is nearly negligible and is
reasonably within the typical 5 to 10 percent variation of traffic volumes seen on any given
weekday.

Since the overall weekday PM peak hour background traffic on surrounding off-site roadways
continues to be significantly greater than Saturday traffic on surrounding off-site roadways,
the analysis focused on the weekday PM peak hour. Weekday and Saturday peak-hour
screenline volumes are shown in Table 1.

Due to the geometric changes proposed at the primary access location along 25th Avenue
NE, this location was evaluated during both the weekday and Saturday peak periods.

              Existing & Future Baseline Conditions
This section describes existing condition within the identified study area. Characteristics are
provided for the roadway network, non-motorized facilities, transit service, existing traffic
volumes, traffic operations, and traffic safety.


Roadway Network
The project site is located in the University District neighborhood of Seattle, and is bounded
by 25th Avenue NE to the west, NE 45th Street to the south, NE 49th Street to the north, and
QFC to the east. The major roadways within the study area include:

I-5 is classified by Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) as an urban
interstate. It connects Seattle to areas north and south of the City and provides access to I-
405, I-90, SR 520, and SR 522, which connect to areas to the east. The closest access to I-5
from the project site is via NE 45th Street.
SR 520 is a state route that runs from Seattle to Redmond, Washington and serves as one of
the primary connections between Seattle and the communities on the east side of Lake
Washington.
NE 45th Street is a principal arterial which serves as the primary east-west corridor through
the University District. In the vicinity of the project, it is has three to seven lanes, including a
center turn lane east of Montlake Boulevard NE.
Montlake Boulevard is the major north/south corridor that borders the University of
Washington central campus area to the east. Montlake Boulevard is a five-lane principal
arterial with the center turn lane used for a median or a turn lane (where applicable).
25th Avenue NE is classified as a principal arterial running north-south from Montlake
Boulevard to NE 80th Street, where it connects to Ravenna Boulevard. During the PM peak
hour, on-street parking is allowed along the west side of the street north of NE 47th Street.
5th Avenue NE serves as the southbound ramps to I-5 at NE 45th Street. It is a one-lane,
one-way southbound roadway with on-street parking along the west side.
7th Avenue NE serves as the northbound ramps to I-5 at NE 45th Street. It is a one-lane,
one-way minor arterial with on-street parking along the east side.
15th Avenue NE is a major north/south arterial that borders the University of Washington
central campus area to the west and connects to Boat Street to the south. It is a five-lane
roadway with a center lane used for turns (where applicable).
NE 55th Street is a collector arterial running east/west between Ravenna Park and Princeton
Avenue NE. It is a two-lane, two-way roadway with on-street parking.
NE Blakely Street is a two-lane collector arterial on the north side of the project site between
25th Avenue NE and 30th Avenue NE and an access street east of 30th Avenue NE.
NE 45th Place forms the northeast leg of the “five corners” intersection (NE 45th
Street/Union Bay Place NE) and connects to 35th Avenue NE. It is classified as a minor
arterial and has two travel lanes.
Mary Gates Memorial Drive is a collector arterial forming the southeast leg of five corners. It
is a two-lane roadway, with on-street parking and connects to NE 41st Street to the south.
Union Bay Place NE is a collector arterial running from 30th Avenue NE to NE 45th Street,
where it forms the northwest leg of five corners. It is a two-lane, two-way roadway.

Non-Motorized Facilities
Sidewalks are provided on at least one side of each of the nearby streets with crosswalks
located at major intersections allowing safe pedestrian mobility throughout the area. The
Burke Gilman Trail is located in the vicinity of the project following NE Blakeley Street on the
south side of the roadway and provides grade separated pedestrian and bicycle facilities.


Transit Service
Bus service in the area is provided by King County Metro. Transit service is provided along
25th Avenue NE and NE 45th Street. The service areas, operating hours, and headways are
summarized in Table 2.

Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes were based on traffic counts conducted in the study area in Fall 2016
during both the PM peak hour and Saturday peak hour (for site access locations only). A few
intersections were based on counts from the University of Washington 2018 Campus Master
Plan DEIS (October 2016) and were conducted in Fall 2015. These counts were grown to
existing year by applying an 8.0 percent growth rate; the growth rate was calculated by
analyzing current and historic counts in the study area. The detailed intersection turning
movement traffic volumes are provided in Appendix A. Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic
volumes are summarized in Figure 3

Future volumes were estimated using roadway volume growth rates as directed by City of
Seattle staff. To develop traffic forecasts, an annual growth rate of 1.0 percent per year was
applied to the existing traffic volumes. Along the NE 45th Street corridor, a 2.0 percent per
year annual growth rate was applied, consistent with direction from City staff. Existing counts
were grown to the baseline year of 2027; this included existing on-site driveway volumes, to
be conservative. Additionally, the following pipeline projects were added to existing volumes
to account for development in the area:

•      4609 Union Bay Pl.                                               •   4738 15th Ave. NE

As noted above, the University Village – Gateway project is part of the background growth.
The building for Gateway was constructed at the time of the existing counts, however the
retailer was not operating and therefore not generating traffic. As such, Gateway traffic was
added as a pipeline project. Future baseline volumes at all study intersections are shown in
Figure 4.

Planned Transportation Improvements
Based on conversations with City Staff, review of the 2017-2022 City of Seattle Capital
Improvement Program, and review of the SR 520 Bridge Replacement Project, one
transportation improvement is anticipated that would impact traffic operations within the study
area prior to the 2027 horizon year. The SR 520 Bridge Replacement project will alter
intersection channelization at the SR 520 EB Ramp/E Lk Washington Blvd/Montlake Blvd
intersection. A dedicated eastbound through-and-right-turn lane will be added, as well as the
westbound direction will have an additional lane extending back to the Lk Washington Blvd
off-ramp intersection.

Several planning studies have been conducted in the vicinity of the project, including the
University Area Transportation Action Strategy (UATAS). The purpose of this study was to
identify potential long-term improvements targeted at improving conditions for pedestrians,
bicyclists, and vehicles. Although these improvements are not anticipated to occur within the
horizon year of this project, the UATAS study identifies several improvements along the NE
45th corridor including queue bypass lanes, intersection improvements, and interchange
related improvements.


Traffic Operations
Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future conditions were evaluated at
the study intersections through a level of service (LOS) analysis. The LOS analysis method
was based on procedures identified in the Highway Capacity Manual (2010), though in some
cases due to intersection geometry and/or signal timing configurations the HCM 2000 version
was used. All intersections were evaluated using Synchro version 9.0.

At signalized intersections, LOS is measured in average control delay per vehicle and is
typically reported using the intersection delay and, for intersections analyzed with the HCM
2000, the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C). At stop-sign-controlled intersections, LOS is
measured in delay per vehicle. Traffic operations for an intersection can be described
alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A through F), with LOS A indicating free-
flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and long vehicle delays.

Typically, traffic signal timing plans are periodically modified to optimize operations as traffic
patterns change over time. However, for a true comparison, existing signal timing plans were
held constant for future 2027 scenarios. Table 3 shows existing and future baseline PM peak-
hour level of service results. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria and
definitions.

As shown in Table 3, several study intersections are forecast to degrade to LOS E or F with
the addition of anticipated background traffic growth. The following intersection would
degrade to LOS E:
    • NE 45th St/30th Ave NE,

The following intersections would either remain at or degrade to LOS F,:
   • NE 55th St/25th Ave NE,
   • NE 49th St/25th Ave NE,
   • S U Village Driveway/25th Ave (site access),
   • NE 45th St/QFC Driveway (site access),
   • NE/NE 45th St/Union Bay Pl NE/Mary Gates Memorial Dr NE,
   • NE 49th St/15th Ave NE, and
   • NE 45th St/7th Ave NE/I-5 NB Ramp.

The intersection of SR 520 EB Ramp/E Lk Washington Blvd/Montlake Blvd would improve
from LOS E to LOS D due to the planned improvement at that location. All other study
intersections would continue to operate at LOS D or better during the PM peak hour.

Traffic Safety
The City of Seattle provided the collision data for the most recent three-year period for
intersections and roadway segments within the study area. Specifically, the data was
summarized between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016. Some of the study
intersections do not appear in the table as they are not intersections of two public streets.
These locations are included as part of the roadway segment analysis. Table 4 provides a
summary of collision history within the study area.

Within the 3-year period reviewed, the highest number of collisions occurred at the
7th Avenue NE/I-5 NB Ramp/NE 45th Street intersection with an average of 5.67 collisions
per year and along the 25th Avenue NE segment between NE 44th Street and NE 47th Street
with an annual average of 6.00 collisions. The other study intersections experienced between
0 and 5 collisions per year.

Of the collisions reported at the study intersections and roadway segments, 9 involved
pedestrians, 8 involved bicycles, and there were no reported fatalities.

The SDOT annually reviews the previous year’s collisions within the City and creates of list of
“high collision locations” (HCL) that are monitored or reviewed in the next year. The most
recent review was completed in 2016 and screens locations for the previous year (in this
case 2015). As defined by SDOT’s annual High Collision Location Review, locations are
identified as a HCL at signalized intersections with 10 or more collisions in a year,
unsignalized intersections with 5 or more collisions, mid-block locations with 10 or more

SDOT has not identified any of the study intersections or roadway segments as HCLs.


Parking
Previous studies1 have found that University Village on-site peak parking demand is typically
higher during the Saturday peak period as opposed to a weekday. This was confirmed with
on-site field observations in Fall 2016. Data from a Saturday data collection, done in Winter
2017, was used for this study. Figure 5 shows the existing parking areas in U Village, as well
as the parking supply in zones. As shown in the figure, the parking garage north of QFC is
not included in any of the parking analysis as it is not owned by University Village. Observed
parking utilization data is summarized in Table 5.

non-December condition. Although the current data observed is within the ITE range, future
demand levels for the center with the expansion will be based on the local rate and data
collected rather than average rates published by ITE.

It is generally desirable to maintain parking utilization rates at roughly 90 percent or less to
reduce the necessity for drivers to circulate while searching for an available parking spot and
to accommodate day-to-day fluctuations. Surface lots are currently very highly utilized,
observed to be 99 percent utilized or “full”. However, the garage was observed to be only 76
percent utilized. The center-wide utilization rate of 84 percent indicates that the existing
parking supply is adequate, although customers currently prefer the surface lots to the
garages.

One of the pipeline projects under the future without-project condition will take place in
University Village. This project, known as Village Green, will develop up to 12,000 sf of retail
and remove 75 parking stalls. Using the 3.79 vehicles per ksf parking rate, this would equate
to an additional demand of roughly 45 vehicles, and a reduced parking supply of 2,226
spaces. The resulting parking utilization would be 89 percent, which indicates the parking
supply would continue to be adequate in the future without-project condition.

                                    Project Impacts
This section of the report identifies the potential transportation-related impacts associated
with the proposed development. Project impacts are identified through a comparison of the
2027 baseline (without-project) and with-project conditions.


Trip Generation
The previously mentioned traffic counts conducted at University Village driveways were used
to establish a trip generation rate for the site. These counts were conducted in Fall 2016
during the PM peak hour (between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.) and Saturday peak hour (between
12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.). This method of developing a site-specific trip rate is consistent
with previous studies2, which included calibrated trip rates for both the weekday PM and
Saturday peak hours.

The total existing driveway trips were summed for both time periods, then traffic associated
with the adjacent grocery store, liquor store, and storage facility was removed. These
adjacent use trips were calculated using trip generation rates published in the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation (9th Edition). From there, a University Village
specific trip rate was calculated and applied to the proposed 100,000 square feet of
development to estimate the anticipated increase in site trip generation. Pass-by trips were
calculated using rates established from University Village customer surveys in June 2008.
The pass-by trips were deducted from the primary proposed trips to calculate the net new
trips.

Table 6 shows how the trip generation calculations for the weekday PM and Saturday peak
hour trip generation rates were established using existing counts and deducting trips from
adjacent uses, as well as the total net new trips for the proposed 100,000 sf development.

As shown above, the proposed additional development is expected to generate 311 net new
trips in the PM peak hour (161 inbound and 150 outbound), and 348 net new trips during the
Saturday peak hour (191 inbound and 157 outbound).


Trip Distribution and Assignment
With a change in the overall distribution of parking supply on the site, a shift in traffic at the
driveways is also expected. Before assigning new project trips to the roadway network,
approximately 20 to 25 percent of the PM peak hour background traffic and Saturday peak
hour background traffic were estimated to shift from existing driveways to the new parking
garage. Figure 6 shows the percent of total trips at each driveway for both future baseline
and with-project conditions. Also shown in the figure is the redistribution of traffic assuming
the construction of the garage only, not including the additional retail square footage
identified in the proposal.

After existing traffic was shifted to the new parking garage, the trips associated with the
100,000 gsf were assigned to the new parking garage and further adjustments were made to
account for the closure of the internal roadways to general purpose traffic. The trip
distribution was based on existing travel patterns and distributions from previous studies
within the area. Figure 7 shows the PM peak hour traffic distribution and trip assignment.

Future With-Project Traffic Volumes
The project traffic volumes, including the shift in driveway volumes, were added to the future
baseline 2027 traffic volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. Figure 8 shows
the weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections.

Table 7 summarizes the anticipated increase in total entering traffic as well as the percent of
future with-project volume attributable to the proposed project. As shown in the table, project
traffic would account for less than 1 percent to roughly 12 percent of the total PM peak hour
traffic volume at the study intersections. For study intersections that do not serve as a site
access, the highest traffic impact is 7.5 percent (NE 44th St/25th Ave NE), with all other non-
site access intersections showing less than a 5 percent impact. There is a negative impact at
the NE 45th St/QFC Driveway intersection due to the shifting of background trips to the
proposed new garage.

Future With-Project Traffic Operations
Intersection operations analysis was conducted in the study area to evaluate the future with-
project conditions. Signal timing at the signalized intersections were held constant for both
the baseline and with-project scenarios. Intersection LOS were calculated at the study
intersections using the LOS methodology described previously.

5.   Intersections used 2000 HCM methodology due to lane and/or signal timing configurations.


As shown in Table 8, with the addition of project traffic, all intersections that operated at LOS
E or F under baseline conditions continue to operate at the same level of service. Of the total
eight intersections at LOS E or F, the following four intersections are site access locations:
    • NE 49th St/25th Ave NE



                                                                                                                             24

      •     S U-Village Driveway/25th Ave NE
      •     NE 45th St/QFC Driveway
      •     NE 49th St/30th Ave NE

At the three stop-controlled intersections, the worst movement occurs on site; at the
signalized intersection, the traffic operations improve slightly due to the shifting of
background traffic.

At the following three locations, the project would impact each of these intersections by 5
seconds or less, which is within the range of normal day-to-day variations and would not be
noticed by the average driver:
     • NE 45th St/25th Ave NE
     • NE 45th St/Union Bay Pl NE/Mary Gates Memorial Dr
     • NE 45th St/7th Ave NE/I-5 Ramp

At the remaining intersections operating at LOS E or F, NE 55th St/25th Ave NE is
anticipated to see an increase in delay of 10 seconds or less and would be mitigated by a
change in signal timing. At both NE U-Village Street/25th Ave NE (which is anticipated to
operate within the LOS standard) & NE 45th St/15th Ave NE, the intersections are anticipated
to experience a slight decrease in delay. This is due to project trips being primarily added to
non-critical movements, which positively impacts the overall intersection delay. The decrease
in delay could also be due to traffic progression from signal timing at upstream or
downstream signals for both locations.


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

Three screenlines closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenlines that
were analyzed for concurrency review include the Ship Canal between University and
Montlake Bridges (Screenline 5.16), South of NE 80th Street between 20th Avenue NE and
Sand Point Way NE (Screenline 6.15), and East of I-5 between NE Pacific Street to NE
Ravenna Boulevard as shown in Table 9. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that all
project-generated traffic traveling from the proposed project in the direction of the screenlines

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenlines would have volume-to-capacity ratios that are less than the City’s volume-to-
capacity threshold; thus, the proposed project would meet concurrency requirements.


Traffic Safety
Based on a review of the collision history included in this report, no existing safety hazards
were identified. Given the increase in traffic, there exists the potential for general collision
rates to increase, proportional to the increase in traffic volumes.


Non-Motorized Facilities
Throughout the area, it is anticipated that pedestrian activity associated with U Village would
increase over existing volumes proportional to the anticipated increase in trip generation. The
UATAS evaluated pedestrian and bicycle conditions within the study area along Montlake
Boulevard, 25th Avenue NE, and NE 45th Street, which resulted in a number of identified
improvements to address known deficiencies along key pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
Given the proportional increase in pedestrian related traffic and the limited impact of the
vehicles on intersection/corridor operations, the proposed project is not likely to have an
adverse impact on the areas non-motorized facilities.


Parking Analysis
Existing parking management policies would be evaluated and modified to incorporate the
new structured parking.
The proposed project would provide up to 733 new spaces in the garage, with an initial build
consisting of 494 stalls and the remaining 239 stalls built on an as-needed basis. The project
would also eliminate 392 existing spaces. Under the first build, this results in a net increase of
177 parking spaces with a total of 2,403 spaces; under the 733 space total build this results
in a net increase of up to 416 parking spaces and total of 2,642 spaces. In both cases, the
net increase exceeds the City’s requirement.

The resulting parking supply by zone is shown in Figure 9. It displays the proposed garage in
Zone 2 and the elimination of parking in Zone 1, some of which is associated with the Village
Green pipeline project (when compared to Figure 5). Parking supply in the other three zones
will remain the same.

                       Figure 9. Future Proposed On-Site Parking Supply by Zone
The initial phase of the project would include the 494-stall garage and the proposed 100,000
square feet of retail. The additional floors of the garage would be built on an as-needed basis
as determined by future parking occupancy. Based on observed parking utilization data,
anticipated new parking demand was estimated as summarized in Table 10.

1.   This includes the Village Green pipeline project.


As shown in Table 10, the future without-project parking supply is 89 percent utilized. The
peak Saturday parking demand was observed to be 3.79 spaces per 1,000 square feet gross
leasable area. Applying this rate to the proposed total square footage yields a new parking
demand of 2,323 spaces. For the initial build, this results in a net increase of roughly 177
spaces and a parking utilization rate of approximately 97 percent, which would accommodate
the forecasted demand. Upon full buildout project completion with the additional levels of
parking, the net increase in parking supply increases to 416 spaces and the site-wide parking
utilization rate would be approximately 88 percent. It is generally desirable to maintain
parking utilization rates of 90 percent or less to reduce the necessity for drivers to circulate
while searching for an available parking spot and to accommodate day-to-day fluctuations.
More detailed parking data is provided in Appendix D.


Proposed Garage Site Access
The proposed new parking garage would be accessed at the current main signalized
intersection at NE U-Village St/25th Ave NE, with the ramp into the garage being the east leg.

The channelization would remain the same on the north and south legs while the east leg
accessing the garage is proposed to consist of two outbound lanes and one inbound lane,
with a curb cut width of 37 feet. Figure 10 shows the proposed configuration. The 37-foot
driveway opening represents a 9-foot decrease as compared to the current driveway
opening. A crosswalk would remain on the east leg of the intersection and additional
crosswalks added on the other two legs. Both the intersection and pedestrian operations of
the proposed site access were analyzed.

Operations Analysis
Future traffic operations were analyzed for both the PM and Saturday peak hours at the
access driveway, including a review of intersection Level of Service (LOS) and queues. The
intersection was analyzed using the LOS methodology described previously. Table 11 shows
the intersection LOS and the LOS for the westbound movement of cars exiting the garage.
Queues for the westbound leg are also shown.

2.   Average delay in seconds per vehicle.
3.   Queues are shown in feet and are rounded up to the nearest 5.


As shown in Table 11, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS D during the PM peak
hour, with 44 seconds of delay, and LOS C during the Saturday peak hour, with 33 seconds
of delay. Queues on the westbound approach are anticipated to be roughly 140 feet in the
PM peak hour and 275 feet in the Saturday peak hour.


                                                                                                               28

Turning templates at the access point for the preferred design were reviewed. The drawing is
shown in Figure 11.

Pedestrian Analysis
The pedestrian crossing along the east leg of the existing driveway is approximately 46 feet
long and is controlled by the signal at that location. Existing pedestrian volumes are
approximately 43 pedestrians during the PM peak hour and approximately 44 pedestrians
during the Saturday peak hour.

The mouth of the driveway would be located outside of the physical garage structure,
allowing for better sightlines of pedestrians. Pedestrian volumes may increase with the
project, however they are not expected to increase substantially. Pedestrian movements
would still be controlled by a signal at that location under all three alternatives.

As the total crossing distance for pedestrians would be shorter than existing conditions,
safety for pedestrians would be an improvement. Pedestrian travel times to traverse the
crosswalk were estimated using a rate of 3.5 feet per second, as directed by City staff.
Assuming the proposed 37-foot curb width, a pedestrian would need 11 seconds to traverse
the crosswalk, which is roughly 2 seconds less than the amount of crossing time pedestrians
currently encounter at the existing crosswalk.

Given the north/south green time at the intersection, pedestrian crossing times would fit
within the signal timing allotment for north-south traffic on 25th Avenue NE without further
adjustment. The differential in pedestrian crossing times has no impact on the overall signal
timing requirements.

                                         Mitigation
As identified in the condition of approval for previous studies3, contribution to UATAS projects
at a proportionate share level were required to mitigate the impacts of the project. The same
is assumed for the current proposed project. The fees associated with the proposed
expansion, based on 100,000 square feet of new retail, are estimated at $555,600.00. This
fee will be assessed and collected a the time of building permit issuance for each
development project. The UATAS pro-rata worksheet is included as Appendix E. Consistent
with the MUP decision for the previously mentioned studies, the applicant reserves the right
to construct certain identified improvements consistent with the UATAS project list. Any funds
contributed by the application, or expended by the applicant in connection with the
construction of such projects, shall be applied as a dollar-for-dollar credit in reduction of the
cash payments calculated within this memorandum.

Other mitigation includes changes to signal timing at NE 55th St/25th Ave NE to reduce
intersection delay.

                                          Summary
The following provides a brief summary of the anticipated traffic impacts of the proposed
University Village expansion.
    •    The proposed project would include the construction of up to 100,000 square feet of
         retail space and a parking garage with up to 880 parking spaces, resulting in a net
         increase of up to 553 parking spaces at the existing University Village Shopping
         Center.
    •    The traffic study was conducted in consultation with City of Seattle Department of
         Construction and Inspections and Department of Transportation Staff, and directly
         addresses the requested scope of analysis.
    •    University Village is situated north of the University of Washington Campus. Primary
         access is provided by the NE 45th Street, Montlake Boulevard, and 25th Avenue NE
         corridors.
    •    Analysis of traffic operations was conducted using Synchro intersection analysis
         techniques, consistent with City review practice for other development projects.
    •    Based on reported accidents over the most recent three-year period, there are no
         identified high-accident locations within the study area.
    •    Based on the trip rates currently observed at University, the project would generate
         approximately 311 net new trips during the weekday PM peak hour.
    •    All study intersections operating at LOS E or F under baseline conditions would
         continue to operate at the same level of service with the addition of project traffic. In
         most cases these study intersections are either site access points or are expected to
         experience an increase of less than 5 seconds of delay. The intersection of NE 55th
         St/25th Ave NE is expected to experience an increase in delay of 10 seconds or less,
         which would be mitigated by a change in signal timing.
    •    The project would meet the City’s current transportation concurrency requirements.
    •    The total supply on on-site parking will be sufficient to accommodate the additional
         parking demand with a parking utilization rate of approximately 84 percent.
