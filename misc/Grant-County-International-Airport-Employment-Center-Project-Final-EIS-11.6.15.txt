The Final EIS (FEIS) for the Grant County International Airport (GCIA) Employment Center project has been prepared in
compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) of 1971 (Chapter 43.21C, Revised Code of Washington); the SEPA
Rules, effective April 4, 1984, as amended (Chapter 197-11, Washington Administrative Code); and the ordinances adopted by
Grant County and City of Moses Lake implementing SEPA (in Grant County Code (GCC) 24.04 and City of Moses Lake Code (MLC)
14.06). Preparation of this FEIS is the responsibility of the SEPA co-lead agencies: Grant County and Port of Moses Lake. The
County and Port have determined that this document has been prepared in a responsible manner using appropriate
methodology and they have directed the areas of research and analysis that were undertaken in preparation of this FEIS. This
document is not an authorization for an action, nor does it constitute a decision or a recommendation for an action; in its final
form, it will accompany the Proposed Action and will be considered in making further decisions on the proposal.

                                       PREFACE
The purpose of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) is to:
      Identify and evaluate probable adverse environmental impacts that could result from
       development associated with the Proposed Action and development alternatives, and
       the No Action Alternative; and
      Identify measures to mitigate those impacts.

This FEIS does not authorize a specific action or alternative nor does it recommend for or
against a particular course of action; it is one of several key documents that will be considered
in the decision-making process for this project. A list of expected regulatory actions, including:
licenses, permits and approvals is contained in the Fact Sheet to this FEIS (pgs. i-iv); this FEIS
will accompany the applications specifically associated with the permit processes and will be
considered as the final State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) document relative to those
applications.
The environmental elements that are analyzed in this FEIS were determined as a result of the
formal, public EIS scoping process, which occurred from February 13 to March 3, 2015. The
SEPA Determination of Significance/Scoping Notice was mailed to agencies and organizations.
A public Scoping Meeting was held on February 25, 2015, and attended by approximately five
individuals. A total of three comment letters were received; no one offered official comments
at the public scoping meeting. Following review of the written comments, Grant County and the
Port of Moses Lake determined the issues and alternatives to be analyzed in the EIS. They
include 12 broad areas of environmental review consisting of: Earth; Water Resources; Plants
and Animals; Environmental Health; Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases (GHG); Noise; Land
Use/Relationship to Plans and Policies; Aesthetics; Historic and Cultural Resources;
Transportation; Public Services; and Utilities.
The Table of Contents for this FEIS is contained on pgs. v-viii of the Fact Sheet. In general, the
FEIS is organized into four major chapters:
      Fact Sheet (immediately following this Preface) provides an overview of the proposed
       action and development alternatives, permits and major approvals needed, contact
       information and the Table of Contents;
      Chapter 1 (beginning on page 1-1) summarizes the description of the Proposed Actions,
       development alternatives and the No Action Alternative, as well as the environmental
       impacts, mitigation measures, and significant unavoidable adverse impacts;
      Chapter 2 (beginning on page 2-1) provides a detailed description of the Proposed
       Actions, development alternatives and the No Action Alternative; and
      Chapter 3 (beginning on page 3-1) is an analysis of potential impacts in the subject areas
       mentioned above for the Proposed Actions, development alternatives and the No Action
       Alternative. This chapter also identifies relevant mitigation measures and significant
       unavoidable adverse environmental impacts.

Name of Proposal              Grant County International Airport (GCIA) Employment Center
                              Project

Proponent                     Port of Moses Lake (Port)

Location                      This FEIS identifies and analyzes conditions associated with the
                              development of an employment center on approximately 1,258 acres of
                              land on and adjacent to the Port. The site is located in Grant County and
                              City of Moses Lake, and portions of the site are on the east edge of the
                              Port property.

Proposed Action               The Port is proposing an employment center intended to strengthen the
                              existing aerospace cluster and existing manufacturing cluster at and near
                              the GCIA.
                              The Proposed Action(s) for the site include:
                                     Adoption of Planned Action Ordinances by the County and City;
                                     Future permitting and construction of infrastructure, buildings
                                      and other improvements over the build-out horizon.
                              Other possible future actions related to the project could include:
                                     Future approval of a Master Plan for the site by the County, Port
                                      and City, to be based on a plan that has been agreed to by these
                                      parties and the other property owners at the site; and
                                     Future execution of a Development Agreement between the
                                      County, Port, City and other property owners at the site.

EIS Alternatives              In order to conduct a comprehensive environmental review, two
                              development alternatives meeting the Port, County and City’s objectives
                              are analyzed in this FEIS. These include Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, as
                              well as a No Action Alternative. The development alternatives are
                              described in detail in Chapter 2 of this FEIS.

                              Alternative 1 represents development of the GCIA Employment Center
                              site with an emphasis on heavy manufacturing and warehouse uses.
                              Under this alternative, a total of up to approximately 8.8 million square
                              feet (sq. ft.) of new building area would be developed onsite over the
                              approximately 20-year build-out period (approximately 6.3 million sq. ft.
                              of new heavy manufacturing/warehouse building area and approximately
                              2.5 million sq. ft. of new aviation development/revenue support building
                              area). The new building area onsite would provide capacity for a total of
                              approximately 13,520 new employees.

November 2015
                                    Alternative 2 represents development of the site with an emphasis on
                                    light manufacturing and technology uses. Under this alternative, a total of
                                    up to approximately 10.1 million sq. ft. of new building area would be
                                    developed onsite over the approximately 20-year build-out period
                                    (approximately 7.3 million sq. ft. of new light manufacturing/technology
                                    building area and approximately 2.8 million sq. ft. of new aviation
                                    development/revenue support building area). The new building area
                                    onsite would provide capacity for a total of approximately 19,010 new
                                    employees.

                                    Under the No Action Alternative the site would continue in its present
                                    largely vacant, undeveloped condition. No additional aerospace and/or
                                    manufacturing development would occur onsite at this time. The existing
                                    County, Port and City land use designations and zoning classifications
                                    would govern any future development of the site.

Planned Action                      This planned action FEIS has been prepared for the proposed GCIA
                                    Employment Center project based on information that is currently
Environmental
                                    available and that has been prepared in support of this FEIS. It is
Review                              anticipated that no subsequent environmental review under SEPA of this
                                    proposal will be necessary if proposed development is consistent with the
                                    conceptual land use map and assumptions that served as the basis for
                                    this FEIS and the Planned Action designations. If not, additional
                                    environmental review may be required under SEPA.

Required                            Preliminary investigation indicates that the following approvals and/or
                                    permits may be required for the proposed GCIA Employment Center
Approvals and/or
                                    project from agencies with jurisdiction.1 The approvals/permits pertain to
Permits                             development, construction and operation of development and to other
                                    regulatory actions that may allow or facilitate development, construction
                                    and operation of the proposed development. Additional permits/
                                    approvals may be identified during the review process associated with
                                    specific projects.

SUMMARY
                                       CHAPTER 1
                                       SUMMARY

1.1              INTRODUCTION
    This chapter provides a summary of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the
    Grant County International Airport (GCIA) Employment Center project. It summarizes the
    Proposed Actions and EIS alternatives and describes the purpose and content of the FEIS
    and related topics in a question and answer format. The chapter also contains a matrix
    summarizing the probable significant impacts of the EIS alternatives, and a final list of
    mitigation measures to address these impacts.

    The Port of Moses Lake (Port) is proposing an employment center on an approximately
    1,258-acre site comprised of properties located in the Port, the City of Moses Lake (City)
    and Grant County (County). The proposed GCIA Employment Center is intended to
    strengthen the existing aerospace and manufacturing cluster at and near the GCIA. Full
    buildout of the site is assumed to occur over an approximately 20-year period. For the
    purposes of the FEIS analysis, the assumed buildout year is 2035.

    The FEIS analyzes three alternatives: Alternative 1 – Heavy Manufacturing/Warehouse
    Emphasis, Alternative 2 – Light Manufacturing/Technology Emphasis, and Alternative 3 –
    No Action Alternative. Proposed development could ultimately contain between
    approximately 8.8 million square feet (sq. ft.) and 10.1 million sq. ft. of new building area.

    Per WAC 197-11-440(5), the goal of this FEIS is to analyze the environmental impacts
    associated with a sufficient range of alternatives that: 1) encompasses a broad range of
    development that the site can reasonably accommodate; 2) meets the applicant’s
    objectives; and, 3) provides decision makers with relevant information needed to make
    decisions about the Proposed Actions.

    The FEIS is also intended to fulfill the SEPA requirements for Planned Action environmental
    review for future development on the GCIA Employment Center site, per RCW 43.21C.031.
    After issuance of this FEIS, it is anticipated that the County and City will adopt Planned
    Action Ordinances for the site, which would reflect the decision that adequate
    environmental review had been conducted for specific projects/uses in the Ordinance.
    When specific applications for the development on the site are submitted in the future, the
    applications would be reviewed and a determination would be made by the County and City
    on whether the type and scale of the application is within the range of development
    assumptions analyzed in the FEIS and adopted as part of the Planned Action Ordinance; if
    not, additional environmental review may be required.

November 2015
1.2              PROPOSED ACTIONS
    The proposed actions for the GCIA Employment Center project, include the following:

            Adoption of Planned Action Ordinances by the County and City (consistent with WAC
             197-11-164) that would indicate that adequate environmental review addressing the
             probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the Proposed Action(s) has
             been completed at this stage of the planning process, and that further
             environmental review under SEPA would not be necessary if it is determined that
             future development applications are consistent with the conceptual land use map
             and EIS alternatives which served as the basis for this FEIS and the Planned Action
             designation; and
            Future permitting and construction of infrastructure, buildings and other
             improvements over the buildout horizon (2035).

    Other possible future actions related to the project could include:

            Future approval of a Master Plan for the site by the County, Port, and City, to be
             based on a plan that has been agreed upon by all parties and the other property
             owners at the site; and
            Future execution of a Development Agreement between the County, Port, City, and
             other property owners at the site.

1.3              DESCRIPTION OF THE FINAL EIS AND RELATED
                 TOPICS
    The following is a description of the purpose and content of the FEIS and related topics in a
    question and answer format.

Q1.     What is the FEIS?

A1.     This document is the FEIS for the GCIA Employment Center project. A FEIS is an
        environmental document that is prepared per the SEPA Rules (WAC 197-11), following
        the issuance of a Draft EIS (DEIS). An FEIS includes all substantive comments received on
        the DEIS (WAC 197-11-560(2)), responds to those comments, and, as applicable,
        explains how certain comments are addressed in information and analyses contained in
        the DEIS. If the lead agency does not receive any comments critical of the scope or
        content of the DEIS, they may state this in an updated Fact Sheet (WAC 197-11-440(2)),
        which shall be circulated per the requirements in WAC 197-11-460. The FEIS shall
        consist of the DEIS and an updated Fact Sheet. No comments were received on the GCIA
        Employment Center DEIS; there for the Updated Fact Sheet and DEIS comprise the FEIS.

November 2015
Q2.     What is contained in the FEIS and how is it organized?

A2. This FEIS consists of one volume and is divided into an updated Fact Sheet and three
chapters.

       Fact Sheet - provides an overview of the proposed action and development alternatives,
        permits and major approvals needed, contact information and the Table of Contents;
       Chapter 1 – provides a summary of the Proposed Action(s), development alternatives
        and the No Action Alternative, as well as the environmental impacts, mitigation
        measures, and significant unavoidable adverse impacts;
       DEIS Chapter 2 - provides a detailed description of the Proposed Actions, development
        alternatives and the No Action Alternative; and
       DEIS Chapter 3 – contains analysis of potential impacts of the Proposed Actions and
        development alternatives. This chapter also identifies relevant mitigation measures and
        significant unavoidable adverse environmental impacts.

Q3.     What constitutes the EIS for this project?

A3.     The EIS is comprised of the information and analysis in the DEIS together with an
        updated Fact Sheet. The following is a brief description of the DEIS.

        DEIS

        In June 2015, a DEIS for the GCIA Employment Center project was issued by Grant
        County and the Port of Moses Lake. In order to disclose environmental information
        relevant to the project and in compliance with SEPA, the DEIS evaluated two
        development alternatives (Alternative 1 – Heavy Manufacturing/Warehouse Alternative,
        and Alternative 2 – Light Manufacturing/Technology Alternative), as well as the No
        Action Alternative, as described below.

        Alternative 1 – Heavy Manufacturing/Warehouse Emphasis

        Alternative 1 would include development with an emphasis on heavy manufacturing and
        warehouse uses. An approximately 70:30 mix of these two industrial uses is assumed
        and a total of up to approximately 8.8 million sq. ft. of new building area would be
        developed onsite over the approximately 20-year build-out period (approximately 6.3
        million sq. ft. of new heavy manufacturing/warehouse building area and approximately
        2.5 million sq. ft. of new aviation development/revenue support building area). The
        heavy manufacturing/warehouse uses would primarily be located in the eastern and
        central portions of the site; the aviation development/revenue support uses would
        primarily be located in the western portion of the site (adjacent to and including a
        portion of the GCIA). The new building area onsite would provide capacity for a total of

GCIA Employment Center FEIS                  Page 1-3                                       Summary
November 2015
        approximately 13,520 new employees. Roadway and utility infrastructure (i.e.,
        stormwater, water and sewer) would be provided to support the proposed uses and two
        primary access points to the site are assumed to/from Stratford Road NE and Randolph
        Road NE

        Alternative 2 – Light Manufacturing/Technology Emphasis

        Alternative 2 would include development with an emphasis on light manufacturing and
        technology uses. An approximately 70:30 mix of these two industrial uses is assumed
        and a total of up to approximately 10.1 million sq. ft. of new building area would be
        developed onsite (approximately 7.2 million sq. ft. of new light
        manufacturing/technology building area and approximately 2.9 million sq. ft. of new
        aviation development/revenue support building area). The light manufacturing/
        technology uses would primarily be located in the eastern and central portions of the
        site; the aviation development/revenue support uses would primarily be located in the
        western portion of the site (adjacent to and including a portion of the GCIA). The new
        building area onsite would provide capacity for a total of approximately 19,010 new
        employees. Roadway and utility infrastructure (i.e., stormwater, water and sewer)
        would be provided to support the uses proposed under Alternative 2 and two primary
        access points to the site are assumed to/from Stratford Road NE and Randolph Road NE.

        Alternative 3 – No Action Alternative

        Under this alternative the site would continue in its present largely vacant, undeveloped
        condition. No additional aerospace and/or manufacturing development would occur on-
        site at this time. The existing County, Port and City land use designations and zoning
        classifications would govern any future development of the site. Retention of the site in
        its existing condition would not provide the County, Port and City with the opportunity
        to realize their goals, including strengthening the existing aerospace and manufacturing
        cluster at and near the airport, and adopting Planned Action Ordinances that would
        streamline future permitting for individual projects.

Q4.     What happens after the issuance of this FEIS?

A4.     The GCIA Employment Center project FEIS will be used as a tool by the Port, County, and
        City (along with other considerations, analysis and public input) in their decision making
        process for the GCIA Employment Center project. This process is summarized below.

        Subsequent to the issuance of the FEIS, the County and City intend to designate the
        GCIA Employment Center as a Planned Action via Planned Action Ordinances. This
        designation would reflect a decision by the County and City that adequate
        environmental review has been completed for specific projects/uses that are identified
        in the Ordinances. Once adopted, when specific applications for development on the
        site are submitted in the future, the applications would be reviewed and a

GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-4                                     Summary
November 2015
        determination would be made by the County or City on whether the type and scale of
        the proposal is within the range of development assumptions analyzed in the FEIS and
        adopted in the Planned Action Ordinances. If the type and scale of development is
        within the parameters analyzed in the FEIS and adopted in the Planned Action
        Ordinances, further environmental review would not be required to support the
        issuance of permits/approvals by the County or City for construction on the site. If a
        proposal is not within the parameters analyzed in the EIS and adopted in the Planned
        Action Ordinances, additional environmental review may be required. It should be
        noted that for future development permits that are subject to state or federal permits,
        the appropriate agencies would determine whether further environmental review is
        necessary.

        Subsequent to the issuance of the FEIS, a Master Plan for the site could be prepared and
        approved by the County, Port and City, to be based on a plan that has been agreed to by
        these parties and the other property owners at the site. A Development Agreement
        could also be executed between the County, Port, City and other property owners at the
        site. The purpose of the agreement would be to specify the standards and conditions
        that will govern development of the property.


1.4              SUMMARY OF IMPACTS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEIS
    The following table (Table 1-1) highlights and summarizes the potential impacts that would
    result from the alternatives analyzed in this FEIS. This summary table is not intended to be a
    substitute for the complete discussion of each element that is contained in Chapter 3 of the
    FEIS.

    The following lists the mitigation measures and significant unavoidable adverse impacts that
    would potentially result from the alternatives analyzed in this FEIS. This list is not intended
    to be a substitute for the complete discussion of mitigation measures within each element
    that is contained in Chapter 3 of the FEIS.

    Proposed mitigation measures are those actions which the applicant has proposed at this
    point in time, and/or that are required by code, laws, or local, state, and federal regulations.

    Possible mitigation measures are additional actions that could be undertaken, but are not
    necessary to mitigate significant impacts, and are above and beyond those proposed by the
    applicant

Earth

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the potential earth-related
  impacts that could result from the construction and long-term use of Alternative 1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Site-specific subsurface investigations and geotechnical analyses would be
           performed as part of design and permitting of infrastructure and buildings
           associated with future site development.
            During construction, TESC measures and BMPs would be employed to control
             erosion. These measures could include the following:
                 o Limit areas of exposure;
                 o Schedule earthwork during drier times of the year;
                 o Retain vegetation where possible;
                 o Seed or plant appropriate vegetation on exposed areas as soon as earthwork
                   is completed;
                 o Route surface water through temporary drainage channels around and away
                   from disturbed soils or exposed slopes;
                 o Intercept and drain water from any surface seeps, if encountered;
                 o Use silt fences, temporary sedimentation ponds, or other suitable
                   sedimentation control devices to collect and retain eroded material;
                 o Cover exposed soil stockpiles and exposed slopes with plastic sheeting, as
                   appropriate;



GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-20                                     Summary
November 2015
                 o Use straw mulch and erosion control matting to stabilize graded areas and
                   reduce erosion and runoff impacts to slopes, where appropriate;
                 o Incorporate contract provisions allowing temporary cessation of work under
                   certain, limited circumstances, if weather conditions warrant; and
                 o Construct stabilized construction entrances with rock pads or truck washing
                   stations to limit excess soil materials from leaving the site.
            During the appropriate dry seasons, wherever possible, soils excavated from the site
             would be reused as on-site structural fill.
            Standard construction measures, such properly designed and installed temporary
             excavation shoring systems, and properly constructed open excavations, would be
             used to reduce the potential for adverse excavation impacts.
            Any necessary fill would be designed to control potential settlement impacts at
             adjacent structures/surfaces. As necessary, adjacent structures/surfaces would be
             monitored during construction to verify that no adverse settlement occurs.
            If drilled shafts are used to support buildings, they would include casing to control
             caving soils. As necessary, adjacent structures/surfaces would be monitored to verify
             that no adverse settlement and vibrations occur.
            The appropriate management of contaminated soils that could be disturbed and
             groundwater that could be encountered during redevelopment of the site would be
             addressed through the cleanup/remediation process and by institutional control
             requirements overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (see Section
             3.5, Environmental Health, for details).
            Buildings and infrastructure would be designed in accordance with the most current
             version of the International Building Code (IBC) to address potential life safety
             impacts from seismic events.

During Operations
       A permanent stormwater control system would be installed in accordance with the
         Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) Stormwater Management
         Manual for Eastern Washington to avoid long-term erosion, sedimentation and
         pollutant impacts on off-site water resources.

Air Quality/GHG Emissions

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the potential air
  quality/GHG-related impacts that could result from the construction and long-term use of
  Alternative 1 or 2.




GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-21                                   Summary
November 2015
Prior to and During Construction
         As necessary, construction contractors would prepare and implement air quality
           control plans for construction activities at the site. These plans would feature BMPs
           to control fugitive dust and odors emitted by diesel-fired construction equipment,
           and could include:
                 o Use water sprays or other non-toxic dust control methods on unpaved
                   roadways;
                 o Minimize vehicle speed while traveling on unpaved surfaces;
                 o Prevent track-out of mud onto public streets;
                 o Cover soil piles when practical;
                 o Minimize work during periods of high winds when practical;
                 o Maintain the engines of construction equipment according to manufacturers’
                   specifications; and
                 o Minimize idling of equipment while the equipment is not in use.
            As necessary, if there is regular heavy traffic during some periods of the day during
             construction, haul traffic would be scheduled during off-peak times (e.g., between
             9:00 AM and 4:00 PM) to minimize the effect on traffic and mitigate indirect
             increases in traffic-related emissions.
            Burning of slash or demolition debris would not be permitted without approval from
             Ecology.
            As required by Ecology, any future development that could potentially cause an
             increase of criteria or toxic air pollutant emissions that would exceed exemption
             threshold levels specified in WAC 173-400-110 or WAC 173-460-150 would obtain a
             Notice of Construction Approval order prior to construction and use best available
             control technology (BACT) on stationary equipment to minimize emissions.

During Operations
       As possible, trip-reduction and energy conservation measures would be provided to
         reduce GHG reductions.
            As possible, GHG emission reductions would be achieved by using building design
             and construction methods that incorporate recycled construction materials, reduce
             space heating and electricity usage, incorporate renewable energy sources and
             reduce water consumption and waste generation (see Appendix F for further
             possible mitigation measures to reduce GHG emissions).

Water Resources

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures would address the potential impacts
  to water resources that could result from the construction and long-term operation of
  Alternative 1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Construction activities would be subject to the Construction Stormwater General
           Permit issued by Ecology.
            TESC and BMPs would be implemented to control stormwater runoff during
             construction, consistent with the Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for
             Eastern Washington.
            Stormwater management systems would be sited and designed in accordance with
             institutional controls defined by EPA in the final remediation plans for the Moses
             Lake Wellfield Superfund Site (see Section 3.5, Environmental Health, for details)

During Operations
       Permanent stormwater control system(s) would be designed and installed in
         accordance with the Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Eastern
         Washington to avoid long-term erosion, sedimentation and pollutant impacts on off-
         site water resources.

Plants and Animals

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the potential impacts to
  plants and animals that could result from the construction and long-term use of Alternative
  1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Future development would be subject to Grant County and City of Moses Lake
           regulations at the time of permit issuance. Additional site-specific critical area
           studies could be required to evaluate potential impacts and identify required
           mitigation.
            TESC and BMPs would be implemented to control stormwater runoff during
             construction to prevent erosion, sedimentation and pollutant impacts on off-site
             water resources and associated impacts on aquatic habitat and species.
            Burrowing owl nesting surveys would be conducted to determine the presence of
             these species within the specific site area at the time of development applications.
            Work would be restricted within 0.5 mile of active burrowing owl nests.


GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-23                                     Summary
November 2015
            Plant surveys should be conducted to determine the presence of the rare plant
             species within specific site areas at the time of development applications.
            Landscaping would be included in proposed development that would meet or
             exceed Grant County and City of Moses Lake landscaping requirements. If native
             plant species are used, this would serve to replace a portion of the habitat for
             wildlife species onsite.
            If impacts to priority plant and wildlife species are unavoidable, appropriate
             mitigation measures would be implemented as needed. Currently, there is a
             burrowing owl mitigation site that was constructed for another project within the
             vicinity of the site. Appropriate mitigation for burrowing owls could include
             expanding this mitigation area or identifying another appropriate mitigation area.
            Specific project design would respond to guidance from the Washington State
             Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) on Priority Habitats and Species
             Management Recommendations, Grant County, the City of Moses Lake and the Port
             of Moses Lake for species that are determined to be at the project site.

During Operations
       A permanent stormwater control system would be installed to prevent long-term
         erosion, sedimentation and pollutant impacts on off-site water resources and
         associated impacts on aquatic habitat and species.

Environmental Health

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures would address the potential
  environmental health-related impacts that could result from the construction and long-term
  operation of Alternative 1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Soil Management – Compliance with the soil management provisions of site
           institutional controls would be ensured, and compliance of all future site
           construction activities with these control measures would be ensured as well.
            Worker Health & Safety – Compliance with construction worker safety protocols
             defined as part of site’s institutional controls would be ensured, and compliance of
             all future site construction activities with these control measures would be ensured
             as well.
            Stormwater Quality Impacts – Cover soil would be maintained over contaminated
             soils where practicable, and/or stormwater treatment and monitoring during
             construction activities that could disturb contaminated soils would be implemented.
            Groundwater Quality – Compliance with the site-specific institutional controls
             during site cleanup and development construction activities would be ensured.

GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-24                                    Summary
November 2015
            Facility/Land Use Siting – A review of use restrictions associated with institutional
             control plans would be incorporated as part of future building permit reviews, and
             either: 1) would ensure that all proposed uses comply with these use restrictions, or
             2) would require conducting additional removals of the contained hazardous
             materials in coordination with local, state and federal agencies, as necessary, to
             remove the use restrictions.
            Discovery of New Cleanup Issues – Compliance with release reporting, investigation
             and applicable cleanup provisions of the applicable regulations would be ensured.

During Operations
       Soil Management and Worker Safety – Utility corridors would initially be developed
         in clean backfill material where practicable. Where this is not practicable, the same
         soil management and worker safety provisions applicable to construction activities
         (e.g., compliance with worker training, monitoring and work practice requirements
         defined in site institutional control plans) would apply to utility maintenance or
         other subsurface maintenance activities.
            Future Hazardous Materials Use – The use, storage and/or processing of hazardous
             materials would comply with local (e.g., fire department hazardous materials
             regulations), state (e.g., Washington underground storage tank regulations) and
             federal regulations (e.g., federal spill prevention control and counter-measures
             requirements) relating to the use, storage or processing of hazardous materials.

Noise

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following identified mitigation measures address the potential noise impacts that could
  result from the assumed construction and long-term use under Alternative 1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Nighttime construction would not be allowed without approval from the local
           agencies (City of Moses Lake or Grant County). Local regulations do not regulate
           noise from daytime construction activities. Regardless, based on site-specific
           considerations at the time of construction permit review, construction contractors
           could be required to implement noise control plans for construction activities in the
           site area for daytime activities.
            Construction noise could be reduced by using enclosures or walls to surround noisy
             stationary equipment, installing mufflers on engines, substituting quieter equipment
             or construction methods, minimizing time of operation and locating equipment as
             far as practical from sensitive receivers. To reduce construction noise at nearby
             receivers, the following mitigation measures could be incorporated into construction
             plans and contractor specifications.
                 o Locate stationary equipment away from receiving properties;

GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-25                                    Summary
November 2015
                 o Erect portable noise barriers around loud stationary equipment located near
                   sensitive receivers;
                 o Limit construction activities to between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM on weekdays
                   and between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM on weekends and holidays to avoid
                   sensitive receptors during nighttime hours;
                 o Turn off idling construction equipment; and,
                 o Require contractors to rigorously maintain all equipment.

During Operations
       Industrial Noise Sources – Future industrial operation would be required to comply
         with the applicable noise regulations which establish permissible noise levels from
         industrial noise sources at receiving off-site properties.
            Traffic Noise Sources – Development exceeding approximately 94 percent of
             assumed full development under Alternative 1 and exceeding 85 percent of assumed
             full development under Alternative 2, would require mitigation to limit increased
             traffic noise on Randolph Road from significantly impacting Endeavor Middle School.
             Mitigation measures could include:
                 o Limiting traffic on Randolph Road to a level not exceeding 94 percent of total
                   assumed trips under Alternative 1 and 85 percent of total assumed trips
                   under Alternative 2; or,
                 o Construction of a noise barrier between the school and Randolph Road as the
                   level of traffic on Randolph Road approaches 94 percent of total assumed
                   trips under Alternative 1 and 85 percent of total assumed trips under
                   Alternative 2.
Land Use

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the potential land use
  impacts that could result from the construction and long-term use of Alternative 1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Development of the GCIA Employment Center under Alternatives 1 and 2 would be
           consistent with the site’s existing zoning classifications and new development would
           be required to comply with applicable zoning requirements for the site, including
           maximum building heights, maximum lot coverage, building setbacks, landscaping,
           visual screening and performance standards for operation (e.g., for noise, air quality,
           odors, hazardous materials, etc.).
            A Development Agreement could be executed between the County, Port, City and
             other property owners at the site. This agreement could specify the standards and
             conditions that would govern development of the site.


GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-26                                   Summary
November 2015
            A Master Plan could be developed for the site for review and approval by the County
             Port and City. This plan would contain more definitive information on site
             development, infrastructure, parking, and landscaping, and could represent a more
             cohesive, predictable concept for development of the site.

Aesthetics/Light and Glare

Mitigation Measures
   The following mitigation measures address the potential aesthetics and light and glare
   impacts that could result from the construction and long-term use of Alternative 1 or 2.

            The development of the GCIA Employment Center under Alternatives 1 and 2 would
             be consistent with the existing zoning classifications for the site and new
             development would be designed to meet the applicable requirements of the Grant
             County Unified Development Code, the City of Moses Lake Municipal Code and the
             Grant County International Airport Master Plan, including requirements to minimize
             negative impacts on aesthetics from new development (e.g., maximum building
             height, building site coverage, separation of buildings, landscaping and visual
             screening).
            A Development Agreement could be executed between the County, Port, City and
             other property owners at the site. This agreement could specify the standards and
             conditions that would govern development of the site.
            A Master Plan could be developed for the site for review and approval by the
             County, Port and City. This plan would contain more definitive information on site
             development, infrastructure, parking, and landscaping, and could represent a more
             cohesive and predictable concept for development of the site.

Historic and Cultural Resources

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the potential impacts to
  historic and cultural resources that could result from the construction and long-term use of
  Alternatives 1 or 2.

Prior to and During Construction
         Formal consultation with Tribes in Washington State would be initiated to determine
           which Tribes have an interest in the site.
            A protocol/checklist for review of projects that includes a form letter for the
             Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP)
             would be established.
            Cultural resources surveys would be conducted prior to specific development
             actions.


GCIA Employment Center FEIS                  Page 1-27                                     Summary
November 2015
            The historical significance of structures within the site that are over 50 years old
             would be documented and evaluated prior to specific development actions.
            Consideration would be given to establishing a team to manage the critical area
             designation of archaeological sites. The team could be responsible for data
             management and consultation with Tribes, agencies, developers and/or other
             stakeholders. A member of the team could be assigned to search for grants and
             other funding sources in order to begin collecting data to improve the understanding
             of precontact land use at the site.
            Consideration would be given to establishing a heritage program that would help
             guide development by incorporating a heritage theme in the GCIA Employment
             Center.
            Consideration would be given to partnering with existing businesses or agencies
             (e.g., Port of Moses Lake, ASPI Group) with a strong interest in history, and which
             likely maintain good historical records.
            Should any potentially significant archaeological or historic sites be encountered
             during development of the proposal that could not be avoided, impacts could
             potentially be minimized by measures including:
                 o Limiting the magnitude of the proposed work;
                 o Modifying proposed development through redesign or reorientation to
                   minimize or avoid further impacts to resources;
                 o Rehabilitation, restoration or repair of affected resources;
                 o Preserving and maintaining operations for any involved significant historic
                   structures;
                 o Archaeological monitoring, testing or data recovery excavations; and/or
                 o Documentation of historic elements of the built environment through
                   photographs, drawings and narrative, at the appropriate level based upon
                   DAHP standards.
            In the event that ground disturbing or other activities result in the inadvertent
             discovery of archaeological deposits, work would be halted in the immediate area
             and DAHP would be contacted. Work would be halted until such time as further
             investigation and appropriate consultation is concluded.
            In the unlikely event of the inadvertent discovery of human remains, work would be
             immediately halted in the area, the discovery covered and secured against further
             disturbance, and contact made with law enforcement personnel, consistent with the
             provisions set forth in RCW 27.44.055 and RCW 68.60.055.




GCIA Employment Center FEIS                    Page 1-28                                      Summary
November 2015
Transportation

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The needed roadway configuration and intersection control would change with increased
  employment at the site, regardless of whether that employment is related to development
  under Alternative 1 or 2. The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the
  potential transportation-related impacts that could result from development under
  Alternative 1 or 2.

Pre-Development Activities
       Prior to development, an implementation and funding plan for the phased
         transportation mitigation package would be prepared.
            Grant County would consider partnering with the City of Moses Lake and WSDOT to
             perform detailed study of the SR 17/Stratford Road NE interchange.

Transportation Improvements
       Intersections would be improved per the threshold guidance listed in Table 3.10-7.
         The potential North Access Road could be deferred until development reaches
         approximately 9,500 employees.
            Stratford Road NE and SR 17 would be widened, as needed, between and adjacent
             to improved intersections to increase capacity (see guidance in Figure 3.10-6 and
             Figure 3.10-7).
            Truck movements would be provided for at all new roundabouts and intersections.
            The Port, City and County would work with Grant Transit Authority to extend
             existing routes from Big Bend Community College to the site, or to establish new
             routes when demand warrants.
            Pedestrian facilities would be constructed on at least one side of the new roads
             developed for the project. The optimal location for new crosswalks at intersections
             would be assessed during the design of those improvements.

Public Services

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures address the potential impacts on
  public services (police service and fire and emergency medical service) that could result
  from the construction and long-term use of Alternative 1 or 2.

Police Services

            On-site security would be provided during construction to reduce the potential for
             construction-related incidents. Such measures could include fencing and securing
             areas where construction equipment is stored onsite.

GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-29                                   Summary
November 2015
            Traffic control measures would be provided for construction vehicles and equipment
             during the construction process and traffic mitigation measures would be provided
             to minimize the operational traffic impacts of the GCIA Employment Center (see
             Section 3.10, Transportation, for details).

Fire and Emergency Services

            Construction worker safety measures would be implemented during development
             on the site, in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health
             Administration (OSHA) standards.
            All new buildings on the GCIA Employment Center site would be constructed in
             compliance with applicable International Building Code and International Fire Code
             requirements and standards, as adopted by Grant County and the City of Moses
             Lake.

    Other mitigation measures that would be implemented to address impacts on public
    services include:

            A portion of the tax revenues generated from future development of the GCIA
             Employment Center site would help to offset the increased demands for police and
             fire services.

            Increased demand for police and fire services from future development would also
             be addressed by Grant County and City of Moses Lake capital facilities planning
             processes and the planning processes of Grant County Sheriff’s Office, Moses Lake
             Police Department, Grant County Fire District #5 and Moses Lake Fire Department.

Utilities

Required/Proposed Mitigation Measures
  The following required/proposed mitigation measures would address the potential utility
  impacts associated with development of the GCIA Employment Center site under Alternative
  1 and 2.

Water
            The Larson zone of the City of Moses Lake water system has adequate capacity to
             accommodate a level of development between Phase 1 and Phase 2 under
             Alternative 1 (approximately 3 million sq. ft.) and a level of development between
             Phase 2 and Phase 3 under Alternative 2 (approximately 5 million sq. ft.), including a
             two percent background growth factor. However, additional water system wells
             would need to be drilled to serve full build-out of Alternative 1, and would likely be
             necessary for full build-out of Alternative 2 (Alternative 2 would use most of the
             existing capacity of the Larson zone).



GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 1-30                                     Summary
November 2015
            The City would monitor water demand by screening development applications to
             determine anticipated generation rates for development. The overall City system is
             projected to have capacity to meet the Larson zone water needs and would provide
             a supply buffer as plans are developed for well drilling and expansion of the Larson
             zone supply and distribution system once development demand approaches system
             capacity.

Sanitary Sewer
       The City of Moses Lake Larson Treatment Plant has capacity to treat a level of
          assumed development between Phase 2 and Phase 3 under Alternative 1
          (approximately five million sq. ft.) and an assumed level of site development
          between Phase 1 and Phase 2 under Alternative 2 (approximately 3.5 million sq. ft.),
          including a two percent background growth factor. However, the City would require
          an increase in treatment capacity to accommodate flows associated with full build-
          out of both alternatives.

            The City would monitor the sewage treatment capacity by screening development
             applications to determine anticipated sewage generation rates for the proposed
             development. The City would monitor projected incoming flows through the
             screening process and begin plans for expansion when the facility reaches 80
             percent capacity, which is anticipated to occur around 2024 (see Figure 3.12-3).

            The Port of Moses Lake industrial wastewater treatment system has some capacity
             to treat additional volumes of industrial wastewater. The Port is presently designing
             an expansion of the land application system that is projected to meet the projected
             demands of subscribed users, and also meet the demands projected for Phase 1 of
             Alternative 2. However, additional expansion of the system beyond the current
             planned expansion would be required to fully accommodate Phase 1 of Alternative 1
             and full build-out of both Alternatives 1 and 2.

Electrical
        GCPUD can accommodate incremental new development with power demand loads
           that total less than 5 MW. However, new industries moving into the site that have
           power demands in excess of 5 MWs would be required to enter into a “Facility Cost
           Contribution” arrangement with GCPUD, the proceeds of which are used to expand
           the electrical distribution system infrastructure to the extent required to serve the
           industry contributor. GCPUD has indicated that a new substation would have the
           capacity to serve an approximately 78 MW electrical load, which is large enough to
           accommodate build-out under Alternatives 1 and 2.

                    CHAPTER 2
        DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTION(S)
                AND ALTERNATIVES

This chapter of the Final EIS presents the “Description of Proposed Action(s) and Alternatives”
prepared for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). This chapter describes the
Proposed Action(s) and Alternatives for the Grant County International Airport (GCIA)
Employment Center project. Chapter 1 of this document summarizes the findings of the DEIS
and Chapter 3 provides a detailed presentation of the affected environment and significant
environmental impacts of the Proposed Action(s) and Alternatives.

2.1              INTRODUCTION
    The Port of Moses Lake (Port) is proposing an employment center on an approximately
    1,258-acre site comprised of properties located in the Port, the City of Moses Lake (City)
    and Grant County (County). The proposed GCIA Employment Center is intended to
    strengthen the existing aerospace and manufacturing cluster at and near the GCIA.

2.2              BACKGROUND
    The County, together with the Port and City, applied to the Washington Department of
    Commerce (Commerce) for an Advanced Planning Grant to fund preparation of a Planned
    Action EIS for the GCIA Employment Center project. A Planned Action EIS provides detailed,
    comprehensive environmental analysis of a project upfront during the planning stage of the
    overall project, thereby streamlining future permitting for individual projects. On January
    26, 2015, Commerce Department awarded the grant to the County/Port/City to prepare the
    Planned Action EIS for the GCIA Employment Center.

2.3              ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS
                 AND PURPOSE

SEPA EIS and Lead Agency
    The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) provides the framework for agencies to consider
    the environmental consequences of a proposal before taking action. It also gives agencies
    the ability to condition or deny a proposal due to identified likely significant adverse
    impacts. SEPA is implemented through the SEPA Rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC.

    The lead agency is the agency responsible for all procedural aspects of SEPA compliance
    (e.g., preparation of an EIS). The responsible official represents the lead agency and is
    responsible for the documentation and content of the environmental analysis.



GCIA Employment Center FEIS                  Page 2-1                                 DEIS Chapter 2
November 2015
    For purposes of the proposed GCIA Employment Center project, Grant County and Port of
    Moses Lake are serving as the SEPA co-lead agencies. Grant County is the nominal SEPA
    lead, and the Grant County Planning Director is acting as the responsible official for the
    SEPA review. The City of Moses Lake will provide important input to the SEPA process.

    For purposes of the cleanup/remediation plans and actions to address soil and groundwater
    contamination on portions of the GCIA Employment Center site and surrounding area, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the responsible entity, and will conduct
    separate SEPA review (see Section 3.4, Environmental Health, for details).

Planned Action Designation

    The Port of Moses Lake, Grant County and City of Moses Lake are proposing that future
    development of the GCIA Employment Center site be designated by the County and City as a
    Planned Action, pursuant to SEPA (WAC 197-11-168(C)). The Planned Action designation
    would reflect a decision that adequate environmental review addressing the probable
    significant adverse environmental impacts of the Proposed Action(s) has been completed at
    this stage of the planning process, and that further environmental review under SEPA would
    not be necessary if it is determined that future development applications are consistent
    with the conceptual land use map and EIS alternatives which served as the basis for this EIS
    and the Planned Action designation.

    According to WAC 197-11-164 (under RCW 43.21C.031), a Planned Action is defined as a
    project that is:
        Designated as a Planned Action by ordinance or resolution;
        Has had the significant environmental impacts addressed in an EIS prepared in
           conjunction with a subarea plan, master planned development or phased project;
        Is located within an urban growth area; and,
        Is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan.

    Consistent with WAC 197-11-164, the Proposed Action(s) includes designation of the GCIA
    Employment Center development as a Planned Action; probable significant environmental
    impacts are addressed in this EIS that is associated with a phased project; the site is located
    in an urban growth area; and, the proposed development of the site would be consistent
    with the County’s Comprehensive Plan (2006, as amended) and City’s Comprehensive Plans
    (2001, as amended) (see Section 3.7, Land Use/Relationship to Plans and Policies for
    further information). Designating projects as Planned Actions shifts environmental review of
    a project from the time a specific permit application is made to an earlier phase in the
    planning process.

    The basic steps in designating Planned Action projects are to: 1) prepare an EIS; 2)
    designate the project as a Planned Action by adoption of an ordinance or resolution; and, 3)
    review future permit applications for development relative to their consistency with the



GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 2-2                                 DEIS Chapter 2
November 2015
    conceptual land use map and EIS alternatives that served as the basis for the EIS and the
    Planned Action designation.

    When specific development permit applications are submitted to the County and City in the
    future, determinations would be made as to whether the proposed development is
    consistent with the conceptual land use map and assumptions that served as the basis for
    this EIS and the Planned Action designation. If not, additional environmental review may be
    required under SEPA. If so, then further environmental review would not be required under
    SEPA to support construction and build-out on the site.

Determination of Significance and EIS Scoping

    Grant County and Port of Moses Lake have determined that this proposal is likely to have a
    significant impact on the environment. An EIS is required under RCW 43.21C.030 (2)(c) and
    has been prepared to evaluate probable significant impacts and identify appropriate
    mitigation measures. On February 13, 2015, the County issued a Determination of
    Significance (DS)/Request for Comments on the Scope of the EIS for the GCIA Employment
    Center proposal. The purpose of scoping under SEPA is to invite public comment on the
    scope of EIS alternatives and elements of the environment to be addressed in the EIS. The
    County and Port also held a public scoping meeting on February 25, 2015, to invite verbal
    comments on the DS. The County and Port reviewed comments received during the 21-day
    scoping period, which extended from February 13 to March 3, 2015.

    A total of three comment letters were received; no one offered official comments at the
    public scoping meeting. Written comments were received from the following parties: 1)
    Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP), 2)
    Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and 3) the Confederated Tribes
    of the Colville Reservation.

    Below is a summary of the key issues identified during the scoping process, relative to the
    scope of the EIS, followed by references to the party(s) who made the comment and where
    the comments are addressed in this DEIS.

            Historic and Cultural Resources should be an element of the EIS. A cultural resources
             survey should be conducted by a professional archaeologist and the results
             incorporated into the document (DAHP; see Section 3.9, Historic and Cultural
             Resources).

            WDFW’s Priority Habitat and Species Map indicates the occurrence of several
             burrowing owls onsite. It is recommend that surveys be conducted over the entire
             site where permanent ground disturbing activities are not presently occurring to
             ascertain burrowing owl presence/absence, as well as burrow sites or potential
             burrow sites (WDFW; see Section 3.3, Plants and Animals).



GCIA Employment Center FEIS                   Page 2-3                                 DEIS Chapter 2
November 2015
            A cultural resource report should be completed and forwarded to the Confederated
             Tribes of the Colville Reservation for review (Confederated Tribes of the Colville
             Reservation; see Section 3.9, Historic and Cultural Resources).

Elements of the Environment
   Following scoping, the lead agencies identified the elements of the environment listed
   below to be evaluated in the EIS:
            Earth
            Water Resources
            Plants and Animals
            Environmental Health
            Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)
            Noise
            Land Use/Relationship to Plans and Policies
            Aesthetics/Light and Glare
            Historic and Cultural Resources
            Transportation
            Public Services (Police, Fire/Emergency Services)
            Utilities (Sewer, Water)

EIS Alternatives
   Following scoping, the lead agencies identified three EIS alternatives to be analyzed in the
   EIS: two Action Alternatives and a No Action Alternative. The Action Alternatives will
   feature a range of building densities and uses, focusing on aerospace and manufacturing
   uses. The alternatives listed below will be evaluated in the EIS:
            Alternative 1 – Heavy Manufacturing/Warehouse Emphasis
            Alternative 2 – Light Manufacturing/Technology Emphasis
            Alternative 3 – No Action Alternative

Purpose of EIS Analysis

    Per WAC 197-11-400, an EIS is an objective, impartial evaluation of the environmental
    consequences of a proposed project. It is a tool that will be used by Grant County, Port of
    Moses Lake, City of Moses Lake, other agencies and the public in the decision-making
    process for the GCIA Employment Center project. An EIS does not recommend for or against
    a particular course of action.

    This DEIS for the GCIA Employment Center project is Grant County’s and Port of Moses
    Lake’s analysis of probable significant environmental impacts of the Proposed Actions and
    alternatives on the elements of the environment listed above. The DEIS has been issued and
    distributed to agencies, tribes, organizations and the public for review as part of a public
    comment period. Comments on the DEIS can be given in writing at any time during the 30-
    day comment period.

GCIA Employment Center FEIS                    Page 2-4                               DEIS Chapter 2
November 2015
      Based on the comments received on the DEIS, a Final EIS (FEIS) will be prepared as the final
      step in the EIS process. The FEIS will provide responses to comments received on the DEIS
      from agencies, organizations and the public, and may contain clarifications to the analysis of
      environmental impacts. The DEIS and FEIS together will comprise the document that the
      County, Port and City will use – along with other analyses and public input – to make
      decisions on the proposed GCIA Employment Center.

      After the FEIS is issued, County, Port and City staff will make recommendations to the
      decision-makers on the GCIA Employment Center project. Ongoing opportunities for public
      input will occur during the process.

      This DEIS has been prepared for the proposed GCIA Employment Center based on
      information that is currently available and that has been prepared for this DEIS.

Prior Environmental Review

      SEPA environmental review has been accomplished for a prior action related to the GCIA
      Employment Center project. This document is incorporated by reference into this EIS, per
      WAC 197-11-635:
               Grant County Comprehensive Plan and EIS (2006)

Other Related Environmental Review

      Groundwater and soil contamination is present beneath portions of the GCIA Employment
      Center site and site vicinity from past operations of the former Larson Air Force Base (AFB),
      industrial activities associated with the aircraft industry and target range activities
      connected with a former Gun Club. Cleanup and remediation of the contaminated areas
      that meet established cleanup/remediation levels is required under federal and state law.

      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assumed the role of lead agency for
      cleanup/remediation of portions of the GCIA Employment Center site and vicinity, and in
      1992, the Moses Lake Wellfield Contamination Superfund1 Site was added to the EPA’s
      National Priorities List. The contaminated areas will undergo cleanup/remediation under
      EPA’s oversight pursuant to a final remediation plan defined by EPA. As part of this ongoing
      process, applicable cleanup methods will consider potential development plans for the site.
      Certain activities related to development, such as grading, stormwater control,
      utility/building construction, public access, etc., would be conducted in accordance with
      institutional controls defined by EPA in the final remediation plans (see Section 3.4,
      Environmental Health, for details).

1   Superfund is the name given to the federal environmental program established to address sites requiring cleanup under
    Federal law. It is also the name of the fund established by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended, that can be used by EPA to perform site cleanup work. The Superfund program
    allows the EPA to compel responsible parties to perform cleanups or to perform cleanups itself and then seek reimbursement
    from responsible parties for EPA’s cleanup costs.


GCIA Employment Center FEIS                                Page 2-5                                            DEIS Chapter 2
November 2015
    A City-owned parcel in the eastern portion of the site was formerly a Gun Club with a target
    range. Contaminants from ammunition associated with these past activities are likely
    present in the soils and potentially groundwater beneath the parcel and surrounding areas.
    Further study and possibly cleanup/remediation would be required for development of this
    parcel.

    This DEIS briefly summarizes the history of the site and the site’s current environmental
    health-related conditions. It refers to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process and its regulatory requirements for the
    former Larson AFB; and, discusses protocols and institutional controls that will ultimately
    set out requirements and compliance methods for construction and long-term development
    of portions of the GCIA Employment Center site and site vicinity. The DEIS also discusses the
    further study and possible cleanup/remediation that would be necessary at and near the
    former Gun Club. The impact analysis in this DEIS assumes an existing/baseline condition
    subsequent to phased cleanup/remediation (that is, the condition of the site after
    remediation has been accomplished). Therefore, only the probable significant
    environmental impacts and applicable mitigation measures related to development of the
    site are addressed in this DEIS. Potential impacts associated with cleanup/remediation
    activities will be addressed through separate processes (e.g., by the EPA in the case of the
    Moses Lake Wellfield Contamination Superfund site; see Section 3.4, Environmental Health,
    for details).

2.4              LOCATION
    The GCIA Employment Center site is located on and adjacent to the Port of Moses Lake. The
    site is situated in Grant County and City of Moses Lake, and the east edge of the Port
    property (see Figure 2-1 for a vicinity map and Figure 2-2 for a site map).

2.5              SITE HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION

Site History

    In 1942, the federal government opened the Moses Lake Army Air Base on approximately
    10,000 acres of land, including the GCIA Employment Center site. The base was used for
    training P-38 pilots and later B-17 Flying Fortress crews. After World War II ended in 1945,
    the base briefly closed, but in 1948 was reopened as a U.S. Air Force Base. In 1950, the
    facility was renamed Larson Air Force Base (AFB). Larson AFB continued to grow through the
    1950s adding a troop carrier wing and an air transportation operation. The base became a
    test flight center for the Boeing Company. Base activities from the 1940s through the 1960s
    were generally associated with aircraft and military operations, including fueling,
