From: Crossings’ Study Team

cc: Bob Harrison, City Administrator

Per your direction, City staff, consultants and community members have spent the last several months
engaged in evaluating pedestrian and bicyclist crossings in Issaquah. This is just the most recent work that we
have undertaken to ensure that the ability to get around Issaquah without a car improves - even while our city
grows. Our commitment to providing a transportation system that is safe and convenient for all users is evident
in our 2014 Walk ‘n’ Roll Plan and our most recent Comprehensive Plan update.

This memo presents the results of more specific studies of crossings, performed by City staff and the City’s
consultant, Transportation Solutions Inc. (TSI). In addition, while reviewing crossings and pending development
proposals on Newport Way NW, we finished our final draft of the conceptual design for that important corridor.
Below is a list of the attached reports, which contain more detail:

    •   TSI’s crossings report
    •   Staff’s crossings report
    •   Conceptual design for the Newport Way NW road section

This memo:

    •    Explains the process we used to gather public input
    •    Summarizes public input that we received about crossings
    •    Describes the process used to evaluate crossings
    •    Lists the major findings and our recommendations

City staff and a consultant evaluated several pedestrian crossings and two corridors (East Sunset Way and
Newport Way NW) for possible enhancements. The evaluation looked at specific crossings that community
members and staff believe could be enhanced to increase pedestrian safety, as well as crossing visibility for
drivers.

The process included:

    •   Hosting a public meeting.
    •   Collecting accident data, as well as previous Citizen Action Requests and Report a Concern
        (CAR’s/RAC’s).
    •   Reviewing upcoming developments in the areas under evaluation.
    •   Creating a process to select crossings for evaluation by either TSI or City staff.
    •   Having a multi-disciplinary staff team evaluate data and crossing conditions.


                                                                                                     Page 1 of 6
    •   Hiring TSI to perform an in-depth study of the more complex crossings and corridors and a review of
        best practices, leading to recommendations for enhancements to specific crossings, as well as
        recommendations for corridor treatments along NE Park Drive, Front Street North, East Sunset Way
        and Newport Way NW.
    •   Developing staff’s recommendations for the crossings they reviewed.
    •   Preparing reports by City staff and TSI.

Public Input

Historically, we have received input about individual pedestrian crossings through email, conversation,
development of plans such as Walk ‘n’ Roll, and Citizen Action Requests (CARs, pre-2014) and Report a
Concern (RACs). As we received this input, we evaluated each on an individual basis and made repairs and
enhancements as appropriate. In some cases, improvements were already included or we newly integrated
them into short-term and longer-term capital projects in our Capital Facilities Plan.

Following the tragic accident in June 2015, we initiated several other ways to gather public input and set out to
perform a comprehensive study of crossings. Numerous community members attended City Council meetings,
one Council Infrastructure Committee meeting, and an open house. Community members submitted RACs and
sent ideas and concerns to an email address that was set up as a new way for the project team to gather input
on pedestrian crossings. Here is a summary of what we heard:

    City Council Meetings (July 6, July 20 and August 3, 2015)

    Input provided at these meetings centered on the Newport Way corridor, where the accident occurred.
    Residents and other community members requested lowering the speed limit on Newport Way; a full
    design study of the Newport Way corridor; improved pedestrian and bicycle safety within the Newport
    corridor; enhancements to existing pedestrian crossing facilities; improved intersection control; reduction
    of shadows on the roadway; and to postpone development.

    Community Open House (July 27, 2015)

    The City held a Community Open House at Tibbetts Creek Manor on July 27, 2015 to discuss safe access
    for pedestrians within the City of Issaquah. Citizens were encouraged to provide feedback on pedestrian
    crossings throughout Issaquah by placing push pins on aerial maps and filling out a comment form. They
    were also prompted to write down aspects of pedestrian crossings that they appreciated as both a driver
    and a pedestrian, and their recommendations for educating the public.

    At the Open House, the City heard some general concerns and some location-specific issues. In general,
    the community expressed:

        • A desire to see consistency in pedestrian crossing treatments throughout the City.
        • A need for education and enforcement to encourage drivers to stop for pedestrians in crosswalks.
        • A need for enhancements to increase visibility at pedestrian crossings (such as increased
          maintenance or better engineering design).
        • A desire to see all-pedestrian crossing signal (“scramble”) phases like Pike & First in downtown
          Seattle to mitigate motorists at signalized intersections turning right on red and not yielding to
          pedestrians in the crosswalks.
        • A frustration with regional traffic congestion.
        • A need to slow vehicle speeds to increase pedestrian mobility.
        • A desire to see more pedestrian-activated traffic signals, rectangular rapid flashing beacons
          (RRFBs), and HAWK beacons installed to encourage drivers to stop for pedestrians.

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 6
Council Infrastructure Committee (August 6, 2015)

The City Council Infrastructure Committee met at Tibbetts Creek Manor to discuss the Newport Way
Corridor and to provide additional opportunity for people to express their thoughts related to pedestrian
crossings along this corridor. Comments received on August 6, echoed those previously heard at the
Council meetings and the July 27 Open House.

Geographic Input

As part of public process, input was provided geographically by areas of the City. These areas were
generally described as: North Issaquah, Highlands, South Cove, Newport Corridor, Central Issaquah and
Historic Downtown. The issues that were raised are summarized below:

•   North Issaquah
        o East Lake Sammamish Parkway & SE 43rd Way Roundabout - Vehicles drive fast in the bypass
             lanes and do not stop for pedestrians.
        o SE 56th & East Lake Sammamish Parkway & Trail Crossing – Right turning vehicles fail to yield
             to pedestrians and bicyclists crossing SE 56th St.
•   Highlands
        o In general – Overgrown vegetation reduces ability to see pedestrians.
        o NE Park Drive at Grand Ridge Elementary - Concerns regarding children crossing Park Drive to
             get to school.
•   South Cove
        o NW Sammamish Road Corridor – Vehicles speeding, lack of pedestrian facilities, and
             frustrations with the “pinch point.”
•   Newport Corridor
        o Through traffic travels fast on Newport Way.
        o Difficulty turning on and off of Newport Way in and out of their neighborhoods.
        o Concerns about how proposed developments will impact Newport Way.
        o Concerns that Newport Way will receive piecemealed improvements.
        o Lack of pedestrian facilities on both sides of Newport
        o Drivers often not stopping for pedestrians crossing Newport Way.
•   Talus
        o In general – Residents are looking for increased visibility throughout the neighborhood.
        o Concerns about Parcel 9’s entrance and sight distance.
•   Squak Mountain
        o Residents would like to see pedestrian and bicycle facilities specifically on the main roads
             coming down the hill.
•   Central Issaquah
        o Maple St NW at Target / Trader Joes – Several complaints about near misses and confused
             drivers.
        o Rainier/Juniper/Gilman/Trail crossing – Trail users dislike this complex intersection with trail
             crossing over 300’ away on Gilman Blvd.
•   Historic Downtown
        o Rainier Trail at 2nd Ave SE – needs a crossing.
        o Front Street mid-block crossings – RRFBs requested.




                                                                                                 Page 3 of 6
    Email

    Additional public comments were gathered via an email address that the City created for this project.
    Several emails have been received to-date providing additional support for improvements to the
    intersection of NW Juniper Street, Rainier Blvd, and Gilman Blvd; requesting additional trimming of
    vegetation to improve visibility of pedestrian crossing signs and signal heads; requesting new technologies,
    stop signs and additional pedestrian and bicyclist amenities on Newport Way; and supporting the addition
    of sidewalks to get from Squak Mountain to the valley floor.

Conceptual Design for Newport Way

The City adopted the Central Issaquah Plan in 2012, which includes Newport Way and any future development
within in this corridor. The Central Issaquah Development and Design Standards (CIDDS) identifies this
section of Newport Way as a “Parkway” that will include one travel lane in each direction, a landscape median
or a center turn lane as needed, and bicycle lanes on both sides. In addition, Newport Way is part of the
Mountain-to-Sound Greenway corridor; therefore on the south side, the Newport Way conceptual design has a
sidewalk and on the north side is the Shared Use Route for both pedestrians and recreational cyclists. City
staff has been working with developers who have or may submit development plans -- to implement
developer’s frontage improvements that are consistent with the concept design. The concept design is
included in the Newport Way Corridor Chapter of the TSI report

Recommendations

The crossing studies showed that:

    •   All of the crossings reviewed in the studies meet accepted national standards; and
    •   Enhancements could be made to help the visibility of certain crossings, as well as the usability of the
        crossing; and
    •   The four “E’s” of traffic calming (Enhancement, Engineering, Education (or Engagement), and
        Enforcement) are necessary to provide the highest level of safety for all users of our transportation
        system.

Although all of the crossings reviewed in the studies meet accepted national standards, we have chosen to
recommend enhancements to many of these crossings. The recommendations are made given what we know
today. In some cases, additional engineering considerations, the availability of new technology, community
input, funding decisions, etc. may alter the recommendations or affect their implementation.

You can find greater detail of our findings and recommendations in the attached reports performed by City
staff and TSI.

Based on the studies and the recommendations contained in these reports, we recommend some near-term
enhancements and other improvements to be funded in your 2016 proposed budget. In addition to the specific
improvements summarized below, TSI recommends that the City develop a systematic approach to selecting
crossing treatments rather than adopt a static standard that is applied City-wide. The systematic approach
should that take into consideration the conditions that are unique to each crossing, reflect adopted national or
statewide standards, utilize the most current technology (where applicable) and create consistency within the
street corridor they are applied.


The enhancements recommended for 2015 may require a budget amendment. The enhancements
recommended in 2016 are incorporated into (i.e., no additional funding would be required) the Complete
Street and Crossing Improvements line items within your 2016 Proposed Draft Budget. Other


                                                                                                     Page 4 of 6

Introduction

With the goal of providing safe, convenient ways for pedestrians to get around our community, the
City of Issaquah reviewed several priority crossings. This report presents City staff’s review and
recommendations related to crossings not studied by Transportation Solutions, Inc. (TSI). TSI’s
Pedestrian Crossing Study is presented in a separate report.

Safe and effective streets and crossings are the result of a number of contributing factors. Some are
physical and others are behavioral. In fact, traffic safety experts label these “Four E’s” as necessary
components of safe streets: Engineering, Enforcement, Education (sometimes also referred to as
Engagement) and Enhancement. This report largely focuses on possible Engineering and
Enhancement solutions that could help the City become a more walkable and bike-friendly
community. Other Education and Enforcement strategies, which the City is discussing, will also help
the community achieve its vision.

Public Involvement

The City held a Community Open House on July 27, 2015 to discuss safe access for pedestrians
within the City of Issaquah. Citizens were encouraged to provide feedback on pedestrian crossings
throughout Issaquah by placing push pins on aerial maps and filling out a comment form. People
were also prompted to write down aspects of pedestrian crossings that they appreciated as both a
driver and a pedestrian and their recommendations for educating the public. Additional public
comments were gathered via email. The City also created a webpage to keep residents informed of
the Pedestrian Crossing Study.

The City has a longstanding process through which Issaquah residents can submit concerns online at
any time and staff will examine the issue and respond directly to the resident. This process was
called Citizen Action Request (CAR) prior to 2014 and is currently called Report A Concern (RAC).
City staff looked at previously submitted CARs and RACs related to pedestrian/bicycle crossings and
crosswalks concerns and the responses dating back to 2010. City staff had reviewed and evaluated
each citizen request when they were submitted, and the appropriate measures were taken at that
time. These measures included but were not limited to signing, pavement markings (new or replace
worn crosswalk markings, etc.), pedestrian activated flashing beacon systems, sight distance
improvements (i.e., trim vegetation, no parking signs, etc.), speed trailer and police enforcement.

Current conditions at these CAR/RAC locations were also reviewed to determine if additional
improvements should be recommended to further enhance pedestrian/bicycle safety. It is important
to note that new traffic control device products and applications are constantly being introduced
and/or new national traffic control standards (i.e. MUTCD Standards) are being developed.
Therefore, additional pedestrian safety enhancements or upgrades could be considered at the
applicable locations after the initial improvements were provided.




                                                                                           Page 3 of 15 
 
 
Pedestrian Crossings

Following the Open House, City staff relied upon the push pin maps and comment forms created at
the Open House, staff’s professional experience and expertise, bicycle and pedestrian accident data,
input received from residents via email, and previous CARs and RACs to develop a list of pedestrian
crossings within the City to be reviewed. A consultant (TSI) was retained to help evaluate the more
complex crossings. This report addresses the pedestrian crossings evaluated by staff. Below is an
explanation of how the crossings were selected by City staff for review and a table reflecting City
staff’s review of the selected crossings with recommendations for enhancements.

Selection

City staff reviewed the remaining pedestrian crossings (those that were not turned over to TSI for
evaluation). Priority for in-depth review was given to crossings or areas:

        That had been identified by multiple residents or staff members
        That had not been previously addressed as a CAR/RAC nor included in a future Capital
         Facilities Plan (CFP) project in the near term
        That may have been previously addressed as a CAR/RAC but where conditions have
         changed since that evaluation

Review

The pedestrian crossings were reviewed by examining the current condition of the crossing. Those
evaluation steps included:

     1. Evaluating existing ADA facilities including curb ramps, pedestrian push buttons (PPBs),
        accessible pedestrian signals (APS), and crosswalks, for ADA compliance.
     2. Identifying potential issues, which may include but are not limited to:
            a. Sight distance
            b. Crosswalk visibility
            c. Driver inattention
            d. Geometry
            e. Signage
            f. Parking
            g. Vegetation control
     3. The above issues were then evaluated against the following resources to determine a
        recommendation based on best engineering practices:
            a. PEDSAFE (Pedestrian Safety Guide & Countermeasure selection System)
            b. National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO)
            c. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Bicycle & Pedestrian Program Resources
            d. Safe Routes to School Guide (SRTS)
            e. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)
            f. AASHTO
            g. ITE Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Resources

                                     Existing Condition: Pedestrian crossing signs installed (no
                                     painted crosswalk). Sidewalk and ramp alignment issues. Curb
                                     Ramps are not ADA compliant.
                                     Additional proposed improvements:
                                     1. Install crosswalk markings on North/East/South legs of the
                                         intersection. ($2,500)
                                     2. Install new radar speed sign ($10,000)
                                     3. Install new ADA ramps ($15,000)
                                     4. Install new Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon (RRFB)
                                         ($20,000)
                                     5. Revise Westbound Two-Way Left Turn (WB TWLT) and Left
                                         Turn channelization east of driveway. ($2,000)
                                     6. Study a change of roadway character to replace existing
                                         TWLT lane with landscape median or buffers adjacent to
                                         sidewalk to encourage lower speeds (25 MPH limit).
    10th Ave NW – Costco/Pickering   Citizen Concerns: Vehicles are not yielding to pedestrians.
    area                             Existing Condition: The intersection of Lake Drive & 10th Ave
                                     NW is an all-way stop T-intersection, with marked crosswalks on
                                     all 3 legs. The location where the Costco Store driveway and
                                     Pickering Barn driveway meet on 10th Ave NW is a 5 lane road
                                     with no formal crosswalk. The Costco/Pickering driveway is
                                     410’ from the Lake Drive intersection and 440’ from the NW
                                     Sammamish Road intersection.
                                     Recommendation: Perform driveway access and pedestrian
                                     crossing study in conjunction with SE 62nd Street
                                     Improvements. ($100,000 study)
                                     Note: Lake Drive will be connected to SE 62nd Street in 2018.
                                     This roadway connection will change traffic patterns and
                                     volumes on 10th Avenue. Consider incorporating crossing
                                     improvements with the SE 62nd Street CFP project pending
                                     study results.

    E. Lake Sammamish Pkwy/SE         Citizen Concerns: Right-Turning vehicles are not yielding to
    56th Street/Trail Crossing        pedestrians in the crosswalk (trail crossing).
                                      Existing Condition: Signalized Intersection with crosswalks on
                                      all 4 legs, west leg trail crossing. In response to a Citizen
                                      Action Request, “Turning Vehicles Must Yield to Pedestrians”
                                      signs were installed on the signal mast arm (2 orange flags
                                      above the sign) and on a post at NW corner of intersection
                                      before the curb return for the SB right-turning vehicles.
                                      This intersection is not ADA compliant (no Audible Pedestrian
                                      signals, Pedestrian Push Button locations, etc.)
                                      Additional proposed improvements:
                                      1. Repaint the faded crosswalk markings and stop bars to
                                           increase visibility. ($7,500)
                                      2. Install “State Law, stop for pedestrians within crosswalk”
                                           signs at the SW and NW corners of the intersections (trail
                                           crossing). ($600)
                                      3. King County Parks will be installing pedestrian crossing
                                           related signs on the trail approaching SE 56th Street
                                           crosswalk.
                                      4. Vegetation at the NW corner behind the sidewalk area was
                                           overgrown and trimmed September 2015.
                                      5. Install pedestrian crossing information signs above the
                                           pedestrian push buttons. ($250)
                                      6. Below are options recommended to be done in phases. The
                                           first is recommended now and if monitoring shows the
                                           same issue continues, it is recommended to enhance this
                                           crossing further with the second option:
                                      Option 1: Install 2 pedestrian activated beacons above
                                      “pedestrians crossing when flashing” signs at the NW corner of
                                      the intersection warning SB right-turning vehicles that
                                      pedestrians are in the crosswalk. ($15,000)
                                      Option 2: Install pedestrian activated electronic Restricted
                                      Right-Turn sign for southbound vehicles on ELSP if flashing
                                      beacons do not address the issue. ($20,000)
                                      Note: Implementation of SB Restricted Right Turn will have
                                      significant impact on intersection and corridor signal
                                      operations.
    Talus – Shangri-La Way NW         Citizen Concerns: Close proximity of Parcel 9 points of access
    Access to Parcel 9, Blind Curve   are on a tight corner.
                                      Existing Condition: Sight lines for access to Parcel 9 are
                                      consistent with the Talus Development Agreement street
                                      design standard for Neighborhood Collector. Sight Distance
                                      easement will be recorded with final plat.
                                      Recommendations: Maintain visibility for project entrances
                                      through restrictions recorded with the property permit.

    Talus – Single lane bridge off       Citizen Concerns: No more detail available, but presume it is
    Shy Bear Way NW at Tibbets           the uncontrolled alternating one-way single lane bridge.
    Creek Lane NW                        Existing Condition: Single lane bridge with wide sidewalk to
                                         allow emergency access if travel lane on bridge is blocked.
                                         There are currently no signs to indicate which vehicle yields if
                                         opposing traffic should arrive at the same time. It was
                                         developed as a single lane bridge to minimize the critical area
                                         impacts and encourage slower speeds through the adjacent
                                         Parcel 14. See Staff Report for PP06-002EV Parcel 10, 11
                                         and 12. Approved by UVDC on April 4th, 2007 and Council May
                                         7th 2007 AB5630.
                                         Additional proposed improvements:
                                         1. If users find the bridge operation confusing, consider
                                             installation of yield sign on southerly side of the bridge.
                                             There is approximately 60 feet in which up to three cars
                                             could queue if necessary. ($500)
    NW Talus Dr./NW Shy Bear Way         Citizen Concerns: Vehicles are not yielding to pedestrians in
                                         the crosswalks, vehicles speeding.
                                         Existing Condition: This is a T-intersection with crosswalks on
                                         all 3 legs. In response to a Report A Concern request, Public
                                         Works Engineering (PWE) sent a work order to Public Works
                                         Operations (PWO) on 6/l9/15 to relocate existing 25 mph
                                         speed limit and pedestrian crossing signs, install new
                                         pedestrian advance signs, and to repaint faded crosswalk
                                         markings. This work was completed September 2015.
                                         Additional proposed improvements:
                                         1. Install two-way reflective raised pavement markers at both
                                              ends of crosswalk stripes. ($300)
                                         2. Study and implement alternatives related to crosswalk
                                              location, visibility, sight distance, possible pedestrian refuge
                                              island, and additional enhancements in coordination with
                                              current developments.
                                         Note: Improvements need to be coordinated with planned
                                         roadway modifications that will result from a current
                                         development proposal. Ongoing coordination and discussions
                                         have been had with Development Services Department
                                         regarding this intersection.

    SR 900/NW Sammamish             Citizen Concerns: Right-Turning vehicles are not yielding to
    Road/12th Ave NW                pedestrians in the crosswalks.
                                    Existing Condition: Signalized Intersection with crosswalks on
                                    all 4 legs. Not ADA compliant (APS, PPB locations, ramps, etc.)
                                    Proposed Improvements:
                                    1. Crosswalk and stop bar pavement markings have been
                                         worn off and need to be replaced. ($10,000)
                                    2. Install pedestrian crossing information signs above the
                                         pedestrian push buttons. ($1,000)
                                    Note: The future CFP project will increase intersection capacity
                                    by adding lanes. The operation of the EB and WB left-turns will
                                    change from protected/permissive to protected only (arrows for
                                    left-turn, no permissive left-turns on green ball). This will
                                    eliminate the left-turn vehicle conflict with pedestrians.
                                    Consider pedestrian friendly crossing features in the
                                    intersection design (i.e. separating right turns/right turn island
                                    and compound curve radius to reduce vehicle speed, etc.).
    Front Street S/SE Bush Street   Citizen Concerns: Vehicles are not yielding to pedestrians in
                                    the crosswalk.
                                    Existing Condition: Pedestrian crossing signs and crosswalk
                                    installed curb extension on the west side. Advanced pedestrian
                                    crossing signs were installed last year and tree branches
                                    blocking the NB pedestrian crossing sign were trimmed.
                                    Additional proposed improvements:
                                    1. Trim tree branches blocking the advance pedestrian
                                        crossing sign for the SB direction. ($500)
                                    2. Install two-way reflective raised pavement markers at both
                                        ends of crosswalk stripes. ($300)
                                    3. Install a pedestrian refuge island in the center lane (need to
                                        check vehicle turning radius, lane width, etc.). ($60,000)
                                    Note: This mid-block crosswalk is located approximately 250’
                                    north of the signalized intersection of Front Street and Newport
                                    Way. Due to high volume of traffic on Front Street, NB vehicle

Summary

As safety is our top priority, City staff recommends incorporating the recommendations listed in the
table above. Some issues have already been addressed by Public Works Operations (PWO) as a part
of their annual maintenance program, others have been completed earlier than the maintenance
schedule would normally dictate to address the community’s concerns. Items italicized above are
recommended to be implemented in 2015, if the City can augment existing PWE and PWO budgets.
The remaining recommendations are incorporated in PWE’s 2016 Complete Streets budget request
or are considered long-term project recommendations as identified in the summary memo.

Issaquah Pedestrian Crossing Study                                                           Executive Summary


Executive Summary
Pedestrian safety is a high priority of the City of Issaquah. Expressed community concerns in combination with
leadership by City elected officials and staff have identified a need to review specific pedestrian crossing
locations and corridors to determine if existing pedestrian crossings are designed and operating consistent with
local, state and federal guidelines.

Purpose and Approach
The purposes of the Issaquah Pedestrian Crossing Study are:
     To identify crossing locations and corridors of potential confusion, concern, and/or non-compliance with
       best practices;
     To objectively document existing physical and operational conditions at the crossing and corridors;
     To evaluate crossing locations and corridors to identify if changes or improvements should be made to
       improve driver and pedestrian compliance and safety; and
     To provide the city with resources documenting best practices for pedestrian crossing treatments, the
       criteria for their application, and tools for designing and estimating the costs of improvements.

The approach for achieving these objectives consisted of community engagement, data collection, field reviews,
operational reviews, and literature research efforts including:

Community open house and workshop to identify pedestrian crossing locations of concern by citizens.
    Reviewing pedestrian and bicycle collision records, Community Action Requests (CARs), and Report a
     Concern (RACs).
    Identifying priority pedestrian crossing locations and transportation corridors for review with city staff.
    Conducting field studies to provide an inventory of physical and operational conditions.
    Collecting pedestrian and vehicle counts and video recordings at identified locations.
    Evaluating identified pedestrian crossing locations, considering tabulated data, field observations and
     current best practices.
    Recommending potential crossing improvements both near term and long term for identified pedestrian
     crossing locations and in corridors.

A total of 21 crossings were identified for inclusion in this study.

Important Findings
In the course of evaluating the 21 individual pedestrian crossings the following overarching findings emerged:
      The pedestrian crossing treatments installed by the City use best practices or treatments that were the
        best practices at the time they were installed.
      Because best practices and operational conditions (traffic volumes, pedestrian volume, speed, road and
        pedestrian facility design, adjacent existing and planned development, etc.) change over time, the city
        can make minor improvements to bring some pedestrian crossing treatments current with best
        practices.
      Pedestrians often assume a higher level of safety and protection than is provided at many pedestrian
        crossings.
      Drivers block marked crossings or fail to yield to pedestrians to various degrees at many locations.

Issaquah Pedestrian Crossing Study                                                          Executive Summary


      Pedestrian crossing treatments need to be tailored to the conditions at each location with the objective
       of consistency within corridors with generally similar characteristics to improve driver
       expectation/behavior and pedestrian compliance.

Primary Conclusions
Based on these findings and the suggested improvements at individual locations in this study
    Although all of the crossings reviewed in the studies meet accepted national standards in place at the
       time of their installation, we have chosen to recommend enhancements to many of these crossings. The
       recommendations are made given what we know today. In some cases, additional engineering
       considerations, the availability of new technology, community input, funding decisions, etc. may alter
       the recommendations or affect their implementation. A phased plan should be developed to bring
       identified pedestrian crossing locations up to date with current best practices.
    A program to improve driver and pedestrian understanding of rights and responsibilities at pedestrian
       crossings should be considered including special signing and marking public education and engagement.
    Following implementation of the improvements recommend in this study, pedestrian crossing
       treatments should be periodically reviewed to keep conditions up to date with future best practices or
       changed conditions.
    A systematic approach should be developed/adopted to select and properly design and install
       pedestrian crossing treatments consistent with the conditions unique to each crossing.

Issaquah Pedestrian Crossing Study                                           Chapter 1 – Introduction and Study Process


  Chapter 1 – Introduction and Study Process
  1.1 Study Purpose and Need
  This report provides a review of pedestrian crossing treatments at 21 priority locations including four major
  corridors. This study is intended to be one component of a comprehensive process for consistently establishing
  and updating pedestrian crossing treatments that are current with best adopted practices.

  Pedestrian safety is a high priority of the City of Issaquah, particularly as it transitions from an automobile
  oriented suburban community to a more urbanized center that relies more heavily on non-motorized travel
  modes. City staff monitor pedestrian safety conditions through regular maintenance and operations activities,
  review of collision records, design of new transportation facilities, review and response to Citizen Action
  Requests (CARs) and Report a Concern (RACs), and conditioning of new development applications.

  As the City matures, travel patterns, mode choices and traffic volumes continue to change. Further, the state of
  the art for pedestrian crossing treatments continues to evolve with new technology and increased emphasis on
  non-motorized travel modes with corresponding changes in adopted standards. The combination of changes in
  pedestrian and vehicle volumes patterns (the environment) and the pedestrian crossing treatments responsive
  and appropriate to address those changes (the best practices) have prompted the City to make an independent
  review of pedestrian crossings to improve safety for predictability and safety.

  1.2 Study Approach
  The approach used in this study involved several aspects of good traffic design.
       Engagement – The City hosted a community open house event attended by City staff and residents held
         on July 27, 2015. Multiple stations were set up, including tables with aerial mapping covering of all
         areas of the City to allow citizens to identify specific crossings of concern. Participants placed pushpins
         on the maps to indicate the crossing locations of concern to them. Participants also provided written
         comments. The number of pushpins at each location was provided by the City for inclusion in this study.
         Previous Citizen Action Request (CARs) and Report A Concerns (RACs) forms were provided by the City in
         geocoded GIS files for the period between January 2010 and June 2015. The combination of resident
         comments and identification of locations where people have concerns were used by the City to identify
         the priority locations for this initial study. These were originally to be limited to 15 locations but the list
         expanded to 21 locations as a result of the quality of the comments and discussions with residents.

         Law Enforcement - The City of Issaquah Police Department (IPD) was included in the project review
          team. IPD shared its experiences regarding accident history and enforcement needs and practices. IPD
          maintains collision records including all pedestrian and bicycle collisions. Pedestrian and bicyclist crash
          statistics were provided by the City in geocoded Geographic Information System (GIS) files for the period
          between January 2010 and June 2015. During this period, pedestrian and bicyclist crashes citywide
          were relatively rare occurrences. Police personnel were able to provide additional observations relating
          to the locations identified during the community meeting and written citizen concerns that contributed
          to identification of the intersections examined in this study. Locations with poor pedestrian or vehicle
          compliance were highlighted to help focus the direction of this study.


         Engineering - This report reflects a summary of the investigation and solution development for
          pedestrian crossing locations identified in conjunctions with the City. The process followed in evaluating
          each location and corridor involved documentation of the following:

                                                                                                    October 2015      1
Issaquah Pedestrian Crossing Study                                         Chapter 1 – Introduction and Study Process

          o   Review of Previous Studies and Best Practices - The City of Issaquah’s planned transportation
              improvements, prior studies and roadway standards were reviewed and were used to inform
              evaluation of each study location. Likewise national publications like the Manual on Uniform Traffic
              Control Devices and other nationally-recognized research and studies were used to ensure
              application of best practices (proven designs that have been vetted through research and formally
              adopted by national standards organizations).
          o   Field Reconnaissance - Each of the pedestrian crossing locations was visited in the field by senior
              engineering staff to review firsthand the physical and operational characteristics of each site. A
              careful inventory of existing pedestrian crossing treatments was recorded to evaluate compliance
              with generally accepted standards. Primary observations in the field related to physical conditions,
              including the number of traffic lanes; edge of road treatment including sightline restrictions, type
              and character of existing crossing type; speed limit; grades and horizontal curvature; and the
              existing controls.
          o   Video Review - Low resolution video was recorded for each study location for a continuous 12-hour
              period (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM). The video footage was reviewed to identify any existing operational
              issues not identified during the shorter field reconnaissance effort at each location. Video recordings
              will be provided to the City upon request.
          o   Motorized and Non-Motorized Volume Data - Motor vehicle, pedestrian and bicycles volumes were
              collected during three 2-hour study periods (7 AM - 9 AM; 11 AM - 1 PM [2 PM - 4 PM at school
              locations]; and 4 PM - 6 PM). Volume information for the study locations is summarized on each
              crossing evaluation form. An outline of the data collection is broken down below between video
              and peak hour data, video only data, and observation-only. Crossings near schools were counted
              during the academic year.
          o   Documentation and Evaluation - The above data and observations were then summarized,
              combined with future development considerations, and evaluated in the context of the best
              practices to recommend potential crossing enhancements that improve pedestrian compliance as
              well as driver expectation and behavior.

         Education – Video recordings at several locations suggest that a significant number of pedestrians
          behave as though crossings provide them both e right-of-way over motor vehicles and a high level of
          physical protection. However, most crossing treatments are designed to be advisory to the driver and
          still require pedestrians to use good judgment and due caution when crossing a street. Based on these
          observations, it is recommended that the City consider a program for improving driver and pedestrian
          understanding of responsibilities and limitations associated with the various enhancements/best
          practices implemented throughout the City.

  1.3 Study Scope

  A site map of study intersections and corridors is shown in Exhibit 1.

  Some of these locations are in corridors where distinctive characteristics such as roadway configuration,
  pedestrian activity, development patterns, roadside features, etc. are similar throughout the corridor. These
  crossings must be considered in the context of their respective corridors as a whole to ensure continuity and
  consistency in the crossing analysis and recommendations. The four major corridors identified included Newport
  Way NW, E Sunset Way, Front Street N, and NE Park Drive.

  The remainder of the report includes the following:
       Chapter 2 includes detailed crossing analyses for non-corridor crossings, i.e. crossings which are not
         located on one of the four major corridors identified above. These analyses include an inventory of
         physical and operational conditions, evaluation of those conditions in the context best practices, and
         suggested enhancements/benefits and implementation considerations of the seven crossing locations
         that were not located on a study corridor.
           Chapter 3 includes corridor-level crossing evaluations of four major travel corridors: Newport Way NW,
            E Sunset Way, Front Street N, and NE Park Drive. Detailed crossing-specific analyses similar to those
            included in Chapter 2 are also provided for the 14 crossing locations which exist on the study corridors.
           Chapter 4 contains a discussion of best practices and provides a list of best practices with descriptions
            and links to resources that will help the City consistently provide enhancements to existing and future
            pedestrian crossing treatments.
           Chapter 5 describes other observations and recommendations not covered in previous chapters.

  Chapter 2 – Non-Corridor Crossing Evaluations
  Introduction to Individual Location Evaluations
  Each of the 21 individual study locations identified in Chapter 1 were evaluated based on specific information,
  and a separate summary of the key study findings was prepared for each location. Each summary sheet includes
  an aerial photo of the crossing oriented with north at the top of the photo. This chapter presents the seven
  crossing locations which are not located on one of the four study corridors described in Chapter 1.

  The following paragraphs describe the information used for evaluating crossing locations:

  Current Crossing Treatment
  A brief description of the current crossing treatment is provided.

  Road/Intersection Design Elements
  A brief description of the roadway design elements including number of lanes, presence or absence of curbs and
  sidewalks, parking, speed limit, roadway curvature, non-motorized facilities, and paving materials.

  Bicycle and Pedestrian Crash History (2010-2015)
  The total number of pedestrian or bicycle related crashes at a particular location as reported by the City to the
  consultant team.

  Public Input Relative to this Location
  The number of Citizen Action Requests (CARs) or Report A Concern submissions (RACs) relative to each location
  reported by the City to the consultant team. The number of push-pins each location received at the July 27,
  2015 open house at Tibbett’s Creek Manor is also reported.

  Volumes
  Total vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle volumes at the crossing location are reported. In most cases, counts were
  collected in August 2015. Some locations utilized historic data, and other locations not sensitive to traffic
  volumes did not have count data collected at this time. Crossings which would likely have significant school-
  related activity were studied in September, during the academic year.

  Field Review Comments
  Key observations from the field reviews made in August and September of 2015 are summarized for each
  location. Field review comments focused on the physical features at each crossing, such as pavement markings,
  locations and types of signs installed, the presence of vegetation, horizontal or vertical curvature of the
  approach roadways, and parking allowed.

  Video Review Comments
  Up to twelve hours of video data was recoded for each selected location. Video observation comments focused
  on how vehicles, pedestrians, and/or bicyclists were actually using each crossing, but also provided additional
  data to locate and confirm physical features. Not all locations were deemed complex enough to warrant a video
  study at this time.

  Impacts of Traffic Growth and Future Development
  Increased traffic from growth, or proposed future changes in street configuration (such as additional through
  lanes or turn pockets), or changes in intersection configuration (such as “T” versus four-legged versus
  roundabout) need to be considered in order to identify safety measures for each location that are consistent
  with FHWA guidelines for roadway type, volume and speed.

  FHWA Guidance (HRT-04-100) Relative to this Location
  “FHWA Report: Safety Effects of Marked Versus Unmarked Crosswalks at Uncontrolled Locations Final Report
  and Recommended Guidelines HRT-04-100, September 2005” was used as a reference to check each location for
  consistency with the guidelines recommended in the report.

  Potential Crossing Enhancements/Benefits
  Possible improvements and additional countermeasures that could benefit safety and effectiveness are listed for
  each crossing. Suggestions are based on the FHWA Guidance (HRT-04-100) noted above.

  Implementation Considerations
  Means of implementing improvements on both a site-specific and program-level basis are discussed for each
  study location, and for specific corridors or combinations of similar locations citywide.

  Impacts of Traffic Growth and Future Development
       Higher density pedestrian oriented
          development is anticipated to generate
          additional vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, and
          transit demand at this location in the future
  FHWA Guidance (HRT-04-100) Relative to this Location
      Does not apply at roundabout locations
  Potential Crossing Enhancements/Benefits
       Add wayfinding signage to help pedestrians
           approaching from the south locate the ELST
           Add additional optional pedestrian warning
           signs for roundabout crossings per MUTCD
           guidance at all crossings entering and exiting the
           roundabout so that all crossing locations are
           better identified for drivers
       Monitor Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
           and proposed Public Right-of-Way Accessibility
           Guidelines (PROWAG) requirements relative to
           multi-lane roundabout entries and exits and
           incorporate upgrades into an ADA transition
           plan so all users can negotiate the crossings
           more effectively and safely
           o Install appropriate ADA accommodations
                after the adoption of the PROWAG and
                consistent with required timing in the
                adopted rules.
       Reevaluate the traffic benefits of the
           southbound through bypass lane against the
           benefits of providing a mixed use sidewalk in its
           place to reduce the pedestrian crossing lengths
           and provide a more direct and contiguous non-
           motorized route along the west side of the
           intersection
  Implementation Considerations
       The elimination of the bypass lane should
         consider long term traffic growth projections
         before implementation
       Cost:
         o Additional pedestrian warning signs and
              required overall signing modifications $
              7,500 to $15,000
         o ADA/PROWAG upgrades $50,000 to
              $100,000
         o Remove bypass lane and replace with
              sidewalk (requires further study)

          beyond a marked crossing are not typically
          necessary unless a crash problem is identified
         Future volumes and speeds (25 mph) are at the
          threshold where improvements beyond a
          marked crossing are necessary to avoid
          increasing risks to pedestrians with a marked
          crosswalk alone
  Potential Crossing Enhancements/Benefits
       If the intersection configuration is kept, consider
           eliminating the decorative pavement or adding
           pavement markings on the decorative pavement
           to increase color contrast. This would better
           delineate pedestrian crossing areas and confirm
           the intersection is not a roundabout, and could
           result in less confusion and distraction for
           drivers and pedestrians using the intersection
       If the intersection can be reconfigured, consider
           reducing curb turn radii and relocating curb
           ramps and crosswalks to create a more compact
           intersection so pedestrian crossing distances
           and resultant time of exposure can be reduced
       A mini-roundabout or roundabout, could also be
           considered to standardize vehicle and
           pedestrian operations so pedestrians and
           drivers can focus more attention on crash
           avoidance
  Implementation Considerations
       The spacing between this intersection and NW
         Gilman Boulevard and Newport Way NW
         requires detailed analysis prior to selection of a
         control option
       A phased approach may be desirable
       Pedestrian volumes may increase with an
         alternative control
       Cost:
         o Remove decorative pavement, relocate
              curb ramps and restripe $50,000
         o Mini-roundabout $80,000 to $150,000
         o Roundabout over $1,000,000

           o Complex traffic signal phasing would be
                necessary so all the movements that exist
                currently at the two intersections can be
                accommodated
           o The signal would create additional delay for
                vehicles on NW Gilman Boulevard so traffic
                operations overall may decline while
                pedestrian/bike safety is improved
       Consider reducing the number of movements at
           the intersection so the complexity of the
           intersection is reduced without increasing delay

  Impacts of Traffic Growth and Future Development
       Recent additions to the schools in the corridor
          have likely increased traffic volumes. The future
          signalization of E Sunset Way and S Second
          Street (mitigation for the school additions) could
          increase future volumes at this location
       Additional growth in Olde Town could result in
          future traffic increases at this location
  FHWA Guidance (HRT-04-100) Relative to this Location
      Pedestrian volumes do not meet the threshold
        supporting a marked crosswalk during typical
        weekday peaks, however off-peak volumes
        observed in the video would support a marked
        crossing
      Additional support for a marked crossing is the
        observed queuing over the unmarked crossing,
        and pedestrian/bicyclist path choices across the
        street in this location
      Current vehicle volumes and speeds (25 mph)
        are at the threshold where improvements
        beyond a marked crossing are not typically
        necessary unless a crash problem is identified
      Future volumes and speeds (25 mph) are at the
        threshold where improvements beyond a
        marked crossing are necessary to avoid
        increasing risks to pedestrians with a marked
        crosswalk alone
  Potential Crossing Enhancements/Benefits
       Place pavement markings at the crossing so
           pedestrian movements will be more focused
           and drivers will be alerted
       Add missing pedestrian warning sign at the
           crossing for NB traffic
       Relocate the Begin and End School Zone signs
           north of the crossing so drivers can focus more
           attention on the crossing
       Provide ADA compliant landings on each end of
           the crossing
       Consider an RRFB installation at the crossing
  Implementation Considerations
       Costs:
         o Mark Crossing $2,500
         o Upgrade Signing $1,500
         o Relocate School Zone designation signs
              accordingly $1,500 to $3,000
         o ADA landings $5,000
         o RRFB $15,000-$20,000

  Implementation Considerations
       The city has already restricted right turns
         between 4:00 pm – 6:00 pm, Monday – Friday
         from Dogwood onto Front Street to reduce
         pedestrian/vehicle conflicts at this location
       Changes to the intersection of NW Gilman
         Blvd/NW Juniper St/Rainier Blvd will impact
         vehicle volumes, vehicle travel patterns
         (potential one-way conversion) and further
         pedestrian vehicle conflicts at this location.
       Costs:
         o Sign updates $1,500 to $2,500
         o Evaluation of changes to the intersection of
              NW Gilman Blvd/NW Juniper St/Rainier Blvd
              would be included in the study costs for
              that location

  Chapter 3 – Corridor Crossing Evaluations
  Corridors Considered
  Crossing locations considered in this chapter were determined from field reconnaissance and consultation with
  city staff to have strong ties to other crossing locations within a transportation corridor. Fourteen of the 21
  individual study locations identified in Chapter 1 fall into this category. This chapter first considers the corridor
  aspects of these locations based on similarities and proximity, and then provides an evaluation of each
  individual location identical to those prepared for non-corridor locations in Chapter 2.

  As noted in Chapter 1, four corridors were identified for consideration in this study. The name, limits and
  number of crossing locations for each corridor are listed in the following table. Corridors, and the individual
  crossing locations in each corridor, are shown on Exhibit 1.

         * Documentation for the Front Street N corridor addresses corridor considerations but does not
         have individual location evaluations for the specific crossings considered as they were not part of
         the initial field reconnaissance effort.

  Introduction to Individual Location Evaluations
  Each of the 21 individual study locations identified in Chapter 1 were evaluated based on specific information,
  and a separate summary of the key study findings was prepared for each location. Each summary sheet includes
  an aerial photo of the crossing oriented with north at the top of the photo. The following paragraphs describe
  the information used for evaluating crossing locations. This chapter presents the 14 crossing locations which are
  located on one of the four study corridors described above.

  Current Crossing Treatment
  A brief description of the current crossing treatment is provided.

  Road/Intersection Design Elements
  A brief description of the roadway design elements including number of lanes, presence or absence of curbs and
  sidewalks, parking, speed limit, roadway curvature, non-motorized facilities, and paving materials.

  Bicycle and Pedestrian Crash History (2010-2015)
  The total number of pedestrian or bicycle related crashes at a particular location as reported by the City to the
  consultant team.

  Public Input Relative to this Location
  The number of Citizen Action Requests (CARs) or Report A Concern submissions (RACs) relative to each location
  reported by the City to the consultant team. The number of push-pins each location received at the July 27,
  2015 open house at Tibbett’s Creek Manor is also reported.

  Volumes
  Total vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle volumes at the crossing location are reported. In most cases, counts were
  collected in August 2015. Some locations utilized historic data, and other locations not sensitive to traffic
  volumes did not have count data collected at this time. Crossings which would likely have significant school-
  related activity were studied in September, during the academic year.

  Field Review Comments
  Key observations from the field reviews made in August and September of 2015 are summarized for each
  location. Field review comments focused on the physical features at each crossing, such as pavement markings,
  locations and types of signs installed, the presence of vegetation, horizontal or vertical curvature of the
  approach roadways, and parking allowed.

  Video Review Comments
  Up to twelve hours of video data was recoded for each selected location. Video observation comments focused
  on how vehicles, pedestrians, and/or bicyclists were actually using each crossing, but also provided additional
  data to locate and confirm physical features. Not all locations were deemed complex enough to warrant a video
  study at this time.

  Impacts of Traffic Growth and Future Development
  Increased traffic from growth, or proposed future changes in street configuration (such as additional through
  lanes or turn pockets), or changes in intersection configuration (such as “T” versus four-legged versus
  roundabout) need to be considered in order to identify safety measures for each location that are consistent
  with FHWA guidelines for roadway type, volume and speed.

  FHWA Guidance (HRT-04-100) Relative to this Location
  “FHWA Report: Safety Effects of Marked Versus Unmarked Crosswalks at Uncontrolled Locations Final Report
  and Recommended Guidelines HRT-04-100, September 2005” was used as a reference to check each location for
  consistency with the guidelines recommended in the report.

  Potential Crossing Enhancements/Benefits
  Possible improvements and additional countermeasures that could benefit safety and effectiveness are listed for
  each crossing. Suggestions are based on the FHWA Guidance (HRT-04-100) noted above.

  Implementation Considerations
  Means of implementing improvements on both a site-specific and program-level basis are discussed for each
  study location, and for specific corridors or combinations of similar locations citywide.

  3.1 Newport Way NW Corridor Evaluation
  Limits of the Evaluation
  This section considers the corridor context and individual evaluations for three locations in the Newport Way
  NW corridor. This evaluation considered the segment of Newport Way NW from SE 54th Street to SR 900. This
  corridor study examined three individual pedestrian crossing areas in detail:
       Newport Way NW at SE 54th Street (3.1.1)
       Newport Way NW at NW Pinecone Drive (3.1.2)
       Newport Way NW at NW Oakcrest Drive (3.1.3)

  The corridor limits and the individual crossing locations in this corridor are shown graphically on Exhibit 2. The
  individual location evaluations are contained in sections 3.1.1 to 3.1.3 as noted above.

  Purpose of the Newport Way NW Corridor Evaluation
         Review Current and Future Corridor Character/Context
         Describe Current and Future Development Patterns
         Understand Current and Future Pedestrian Crossing Demand
         Review Current and Future Traffic Volumes
         Describe Current and Future Traffic Level of Service
         Identify Strategies for Managing Current and Future Speeds
         Identify Actions to Improve Current and Future Pedestrian/Non-motorized Safety
         Suggest Future Corridor Plan Elements
         Identify Implementation Challenges

  Current and Future Corridor Character/Context
  The character and context of a road or street has a significant influence on how drivers, bicyclists and
  pedestrians use a facility. Most drivers would not choose to drive 60 mph on a narrow urban street in an urban
  grid system like Olde Town Issaquah (Front Street) and most drivers would not choose to drive 25 mph on
  Interstate 90. Signs have some influence on driver behavior, but the conditions at the edge of the road (wheat
  field, cliff, sidewalk, or building faces) and the width of the road, number and width of lanes, distance between
  intersections and driveways, and horizontal and vertical curvature of the roadway all have greater affects than
  signing. Similarly bicyclists and pedestrians use facilities differently depending on the same features, as well as
  the presence or absence of shoulders, bike lanes, sidewalks, or trails. When properly designed, roadways create
  an environment that encourages drivers to travel at appropriate speeds and to watch for non-motorized users.

  Current Corridor Character/Context
  Newport Way NW parallels Interstate 90 generally heading east/west and provides a linkage between SR 900
  and Lakemont Blvd as well as several existing subdivisions in this segment. Newport Way NW is classified as a
  Minor Arterial (serving intra-city and some through traffic trips as well as local and intra-city bus routes and
  providing access to abutting land uses) and as a Minor Transitway in the Comprehensive Plan (exhibiting
  medium bus volumes and functioning as a minor corridor or single route for buses), even though Metro no
  longer has a route on Newport Way NW. Increased development in the corridor may support the reinstatement
  of transit service in the future.
