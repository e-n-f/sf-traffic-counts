Revised Transportation Impact Analysis
1001 Broadway                                                                         January 2016



                                         Introduction
This transportation impact analysis (TIA) identifies potential transportation-related impacts
associated with the development of a mixed-use building located on the northwest corner of
the Broadway and Madison Street intersection in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle. As
necessary, mitigation measures are identified that would offset or reduce significant
transportation related impacts that the project may have on the surrounding transportation
system.


Project Description
The proposed project is located on the northwest corner of the Madison Street and Broadway
intersection. The development would construct a residential building with approximately 265
multifamily dwelling units as well as approximately 46,700 square feet of grocery use. The
existing medical-dental office building on the site would be removed with development of the
proposed project. On-site parking for the retail and residential uses will be provided in a
below-grade garage with approximately 355 stalls accessed via Harvard Avenue. The
location of the project and garage access is included in the preliminary site plan in Figure 2. It
is anticipated the development would be completed and occupied by 2018.


Study Scope
The scope of this analysis was coordinated through City of Seattle DPD staff. Based on the
anticipated vehicular impacts of the proposed project, the following intersections were
selected for analysis:
    1. Broadway / E Union Street
    2. Harvard Avenue / Spring Street
    3. Broadway / Harvard Avenue
    4. 12th Ave / E Union Street / E Madison Street
    5. Broadway / Madison Street
    6. Boylston Avenue / Madison Street
    7. Boren Avenue / Madison Street
Five of the seven off-site study intersections are controlled by traffic signals while Harvard
Avenue / Spring Street is yield-controlled and Broadway / Harvard Avenue is stop-controlled
on the Harvard Avenue approach. In addition to the off-site intersections, the garage access
on Harvard Avenue was also evaluated.

Consistent with City requirements, the study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour. The
analysis begins by describing conditions in the vicinity of the project site; including the
roadway network, existing and future without-project weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes,
traffic operations, traffic safety, transit service, and non-motorized facilities. Future (2018)
with-project conditions are determined by adding site-generated traffic to future without-
project volumes. The project’s impacts on the surrounding transportation system were
identified by comparing the future with-project conditions to the future without-project
conditions.

        Existing & Future Without-Project Conditions
This section describes both existing and future (2018) without-project conditions within the
identified study area. Study area characteristics are provided for the roadway network and
planned improvements, existing and future forecast without-project traffic volumes, traffic
operations, traffic safety, transit service, and non-motorized facilities.


Roadway Network
The following sections describe the existing street network within the vicinity of the proposed
project and any anticipated changes resulting from planned improvements.

Existing Inventory
Characteristics of the existing street network in the proposed project vicinity are shown in
Table 1. As shown on Figure 1 and in Table 1, the site is surrounded by 2 - 4 lane facilities
with relatively low travel speeds. The street system in the vicinity of the site provides
pedestrian and bicycle connections as well as parking.

Planned Improvements
Based on a review of the City of Seattle 2015 – 2020 Adopted Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), three transit projects were identified in the project vicinity. These projects include:

           Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit
           First Hill Streetcar
           Broadway Streetcar Extension

The Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit and Broadway Streetcar Extension are not anticipated
to be constructed by the project’s horizon year. If they are constructed, they would further
enhance the transit connectivity, frequency, and reliability around the project site which would
likely reduce vehicle ownership and reduce overall vehicle trips. The First Hill Streetcar is
anticipated to begin operation by the end of 2015 and connect Capitol Hill and First Hill with
the International District and Pioneer Square. The project is completely constructed and the
channelization and signal phasing at study intersections along Broadway in early 2015 when
traffic volume counts were conducted for this project are consistent with the final alignment
with the streetcar operational. No CIP projects were identified in the study area that would
affect intersection capacity or travel patterns by the project’s horizon year.

Traffic Volumes
The following sections document the development of the traffic volumes used in the existing
and future without-project operations analysis.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown in
Figure 3. Traffic counts were collected at the study intersections in April 2015. Detailed
intersection traffic counts are provided in Appendix A. Traffic volumes were rounded to the
nearest five vehicles as weekday volumes fluctuate day-to-day due to various conditions.

Future Without-Project Volumes
Future horizon year (2018) without-project volumes were estimated by growing the existing
weekday PM peak hour traffic volumes by an annual growth rate and adding in project trips
from other developments in the project vicinity. To account for smaller development in the
area and for general background growth in traffic volumes, an annual growth rate of 2 percent
was added to the existing intersection traffic volumes. In addition, estimated traffic volumes
generated from the 1321 Seneca Street development were added to the study intersections.
This project has been permitted but has not been constructed and occupied, thus not
generating vehicle trips. Future (2018) without-project traffic volumes used in the future
without-project analysis are shown in Figure 4.

Traffic Operations
The operational characteristics of an intersection are determined by calculating the
intersection level of service (LOS). For signalized locations, LOS is measured in average
delay per vehicle and is reported for the intersections as a whole. At side-street stop-
controlled intersections, LOS is measured in average delay per vehicle and is reported for the
worst operating approach or movement of the intersection. Traffic operations for an
intersection can be described alphabetically with a range of levels of service (LOS A through
F), with LOS A indicating free-flowing traffic and LOS F indicating extreme congestion and
long vehicle delays. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of LOS criteria and
definitions.

Weekday PM peak hour traffic operations for existing and future without-project conditions
were evaluated at the study intersections based on the procedures identified in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) (2010), and were evaluated using the Synchro 9 software program.
Results are summarized in Table 2. Detailed LOS worksheets for each intersection analysis
are included in Appendix C.

As shown in Table 2, during the weekday PM peak hour all of the study intersections
currently operate at LOS D or better during both existing conditions and 2018 without-project
conditions. All study intersections are anticipated to operate at the same LOS during both
existing and future without-project conditions with incremental increases in vehicle delay of
approximately 0 to 5 seconds due to growth in traffic volumes.


Traffic Safety
Recent collision records were reviewed within the study area to identify existing traffic safety
issues at the study intersections. The most recent three year summary of collision data from
SDOT is for the period between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. In addition to the
intersections, collision data along the roadways fronting the project were analyzed to evaluate
the safety of the project driveways and pedestrian/bicycle safety. This information is
summarized in Table 3.

The City of Seattle has adopted criteria for assigning High Collision Location status to
signalized intersections with ten or more reported collisions per year and unsignalized
intersections with five or more reported collisions per year. Table 3 shows that the signalized
study intersections averaged eight or fewer collisions per year, and that the unsignalized



                                                                                                                              Page 8

intersections averaged less than five collisions per year. None of the study intersections meet
the High Accident Location criteria.

The most frequent collision type at the study intersections involved left-turn collisions followed
by angle collisions. There were a total of nine pedestrian-related collisions and six bicycle-
related collisions during the three year period. The Broadway / Madison Street intersection
experienced the most pedestrian collisions with 3 occurring, all in 2014. This intersection was
reconfigured and was under construction in 2013 and 2014 with the addition of the First Hill
Streetcar track and Broadway bike lane. Pedestrian crosswalks have been restriped and
permanent signage has been installed to provide guidance to vehicles and pedestrians. The
12th Avenue E / E Madison Street experienced the most bicycle collisions with 4 occurring
over the 3 year period. The intersection of Broadway / E Union Street and Boren Avenue /
Madison Street experienced one bicycle collision each. At 12th Avenue E / E Madison Street,
the collisions occurred on 12th Avenue E for bicyclists traveling northbound and southbound
at the intersection. 12th Avenue E has been identified in the City’s 2015 Bicycle Master Plan
Implementation Plan to have bicycle lanes with minor in-street separation to be installed from
E John Street to Yesler Way. In addition, the Broadway protected bike lane located 2 blocks
to the west would provide bicycle lane from E Aloha Street to Yesler Way.

Future
Transit service near the proposed development is anticipated to become more frequent and
reliable with planned transit improvements. Future transit projects are described below:

First Hill Streetcar is anticipated to begin operation in 2015 and include modern streetcar
service on Broadway serving Capitol Hill and First Hill and continue with service to the
International District and Pioneer Square. The Broadway Streetcar Extension project is
currently being studied and would extend the streetcar from its current north terminus of
Denny Way to Roy Street on Broadway. These projects will provide direct connections from
the surrounding neighborhoods to the project site with a stop on Broadway at Marion Street,
approximately one block south of the proposed development.

University Link Light Rail is anticipated to begin operation in 2016 and would provide
below-ground rail service between the University District and the existing Central Link light
rail in Downtown Seattle via Capitol Hill. The Capitol Hill station is at Broadway and Denny
Way, approximately one-half mile from the proposed development. With the opening of the


                                                                                         Page 10

University Link Light Rail, transit rerouting near the project site is anticipated to provide
service to and from the Capitol Hill station.

Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit is currently in planning and design stages and would
provide rapid transit service from Downtown Seattle to the Central District through First Hill
and Capitol Hill along Madison Street. The service would include signal priority, off-board
payment system, and dedicated transit lanes along Madison Street. The project would run
adjacent to the development project and the nearest stop is anticipated approximately one
block from the proposed development at Boylston Street. This rapid transit project is
anticipated to begin operation in 2019, one year after the proposed development’s opening.


Non-Motorized Transportation Facilities
Broadway has a protected two-way protected bike lane between Howell Street and Yesler Way
including along the eastern edge of the proposed development with protected signal phasing on
Broadway. In addition, E Union Street and 12th Avenue have striped bicycle lanes on both
sides of the street in the vicinity of the project. The Madison Street Bus Rapid Transit would
also construct a parallel protected bicycle lane from Downtown to the Central District through
the project area. This lane is currently planned to run along Union Street in the project vicinity,
approximately one block from the proposed development. The City’s bikeshare service, Pronto,
currently serves the project area with stations located on Pine Street north of the project. This
service is anticipated to expand with additional stations and greater service area in the future.

Sidewalks are provided on both sides for all the streets in the project vicinity. Striped pedestrian
crosswalks pedestrian crossing signals are included at each of the signalized intersections.
Pedestrian mobility is further aided in the study area with automatic recall of walk phases at
traffic signals and with shortened crossing distances through the use of curb bulbs.

                                           Project Impacts
This section of the analysis documents the proposed project’s impacts on the surrounding
roadway network and at study intersections. First, estimated traffic volumes generated by the
proposed project are distributed and assigned to adjacent roadways and intersections within
the study area for the weekday PM peak hour. Next, project trips are added to future without-
project traffic volumes and the potential impact to traffic operations and the City’s
transportation concurrency program are identified. Site-specific items are also discussed
such as the traffic operations of the site’s alley access and estimated on-site parking
demand.


Trip Generation
In order to estimate the proposed project’s trip generation, weekday daily and PM peak hour
person trip rates were estimated for the proposed land uses. Initial vehicle trip rates were
identified for the residential and existing medical-dental office by using the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th Edition, 2012). The methodology
used in this analysis has been approved by City staff and is consistent with previous studies
conducted in the area. The flow chart below illustrates the trip generation process.

                                                      Vehicle Trips




Some ITE land uses represent vehicle trip rates observed in more suburban settings than the
proposed project. To calibrate the trip generation to the local character of the proposed
project, the vehicle trips based on ITE trip rates are converted to person trips through the use
of average vehicle occupancy (AVO) rates derived from NCHRP Report 365. Once person
trips were derived, local mode split information, from American Community Survey (ACS)
data1 was applied to arrive at transit, non-motorized, carpool and single occupant vehicles
(SOV) trips. Person trips by mode were determined by multiplying the person trips by the
estimated mode splits.

For the grocery store, a trip generation study was conducted at a nearby, similar-sized
grocery store in January 2015 during the weekday PM peak hour. Customer counts were
conducted at each of the store’s entrances to obtain a total person trip generation rate for the
existing store based on its total square footage. The highest one hour of vehicle traffic from
the two hour period each day was used to determine the peak hour vehicle and person trip
generation rate of the store. The person trip generation rate included approximately 17.47
people per 1,000 square feet during the highest hour from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., which is
approximately 60 percent higher than ITE Trip Generation manual rate for supermarkets
during the weekday PM peak hour period.

The mode of arrival to the grocery store was also observed during the trip generation study
and vehicle trips accounted for 8 percent and 7 percent of all trips over the two-day period.
To provide a conservative analysis of project-related impacts for this proposed development,
it was assumed that the 25 percent of retail related project trips would be via automobile. A
summary of the grocery store trip generation study is included in Appendix D.

Table 4 shows the resulting weekday daily and PM peak hour vehicle trip generation.
Detailed trip generation calculations for the proposed development are provided in

2.     For the Grocery Store, a trip generation study was conducted at an existing nearby grocery store during the PM Peak hour. Daily
       Trip generation rates were considered to be 10 greater than the trip generation during the PM peak hour.


As shown in the Table 4, the development is anticipated to generate 1,270 net new vehicular
weekday daily trips with 125 total trips occurring during an average weekday PM peak hour.


Trip Distribution & Assignment
Travel patterns for vehicular traffic to and from the proposed site were based primarily on
guidance from the Director’s Rule 5-2009 as well as a review of the US Census On The Map
tool for residential travel patterns in the area and a rooftop density survey to estimate the
distribution of the project related traffic for the grocery store. Figure 5 shows the expected
project trip distribution patterns for the residential and retail land uses to the surrounding local
and regional street system.

Project trips were assigned to each of the study intersections using the expected distribution
patterns as shown in Figure 6. Pass-by trips were assigned to the study intersections at the
site access based on existing traffic volumes on Madison Street and Broadway. Turn
restrictions at the Broadway / Harvard Avenue and Broadway / Madison Street intersections
were considered in the routing of pass-by trips. At the project’s garage access on Harvard
Avenue, the full trip generation was assigned to evaluate the garage operations.

The project generated traffic was added to future without-project weekday PM peak hour
traffic volumes to form the basis of the with-project analysis. At the Harvard Avenue /
Broadway intersection, 10 vehicles currently making a left-turn from Harvard to Broadway
were removed as this movement is illegal and would continue to be restricted with
development of the project through the construction of an expanded curb bulb and
realignment of the Harvard Avenue approach with Broadway. The resulting 2018 with-project
traffic volumes are shown on Figure 7.

As shown in Table 5, the traffic volume impacts at off-site intersections mostly range from
approximately 1 percent to 10 percent. The project does have a higher impact at the
intersection of Harvard Avenue / Spring Street given the impacts are greatest near the project
site and this intersection has a low volume of traffic. The traffic volume at this intersection is
anticipated to increase by approximately 39 percent with development of the proposed
project but would still have a relatively low volume of traffic. Due to the increase in traffic
volumes at this intersection, a stop sign on the eastbound approach of Spring Street onto
Harvard Avenue may be installed by SDOT for traffic control. This would facilitate pedestrian
crossings of Spring Street and would reduce vehicle conflicts at the currently uncontrolled
intersection.


Traffic Operations Impact
A future with-project level-of-service analysis was conducted for the weekday PM peak hour
to analyze traffic impacts of the proposed project. The same methodologies were applied as
described for existing and future without-project conditions and all intersection parameters
such as channelization and intersection control were consistent with those used in the
evaluation of future without-project conditions. A comparison of 2018 horizon year future
without-project and future with-project weekday PM peak hour traffic operations is
summarized in Table 6. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

During the weekday PM peak hour, the addition of with-project traffic would result in minimal
increases in delay at the study intersections. All offsite intersections are forecast to operate at
LOS D or better under with-project conditions. Average vehicle delay is anticipated to
increase by approximately 4 seconds or fewer at each intersection.


Site Access
The project would construct a below-grade garage for retail customers and residential
tenants. The garage would be on Harvard Street, south of the Spring Street intersection. The
location of the garage access was coordinated through SDOT and DPD staff as locating the
garage in the alley, is typically required by Seattle Municipal Code, would increase the
probability of conflicts and blocking caused by freight activity.

At the garage access location on Harvard Avenue, LOS calculations were completed similar
to the off-site intersections. The total project peak hour trip generation was assigned,
including pass-by trips to the site, to evaluate the operations of the garage. The garage
access is anticipated to operate at LOS B with approximately 10 seconds of delay. Detailed
LOS worksheets are included in Appendix C.

The proposed development is currently developing Street Improvement Plans (SIP) through
the coordination with SDOT and DPD. These plans are designed to provide adequate
sidewalks on the buildings frontages and connections to the neighboring street system. In
addition to the requirements of the SIP, the proposed development would build an oversized
curb extension on Harvard Avenue at the Broadway intersection. This extension would
reduce the crossing distance for pedestrians along Harvard Avenue while creating a
perpendicular aligned roadway with Broadway to create better sightlines for vehicles.


Freight Access
Freight and loading dock access for the project would be conducted off the alley with delivery
trucks managed through a Dock Management Plan. Delivery trucks would be expected to
enter the alley via Spring Street and exit via Madison Street. Deliveries are typically
anticipated to occur during off-peak hours to reduce the potential for queuing and blocking on
Madison Street as well as reduce conflicts near the grocery entrance. On Spring Street
between Harvard Avenue and the alley serving the development, on-street parking spaces
may be removed or restricted to allow for maneuvering of delivery vehicles.

The proposed loading area is anticipated to have two loading docks for the freight access.
One of the docks will be reserved for use by the commercial tenant with the second dock
shared between the residential and commercial uses. Based on counts conducted at loading
docks at similar Whole Foods grocery stores in Seattle, it is estimated there would be
approximately 56 commercial deliveries per day. Additional, freight vehicle information is
shown in Table 7. The loading dock access is shown in Figure 8 along with the turning path
of the truck to and from the docks shown.

In addition to the daily freight volumes, the hourly arrival of trucks and van deliveries at the
four stores which were counted were summarized. The hourly variation, as well as the
average hourly truck volume, is shown in Figure 9.




                        Figure 9: Observed Hourly Loading Dock Activity

Based on the counts, the loading volumes at similar stores ranged from 0 to 16 per hour. On
average, 2 to 6 deliveries were observed per hour from 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Based on
delivery patterns described for similar stores, it is anticipated one large truck (WB-50) would
arrive in the morning and unload and a second large truck would arrive and unload in the
afternoon or evening. Throughout the day, the remaining loading docks traffic is anticipated to
be smaller and consist of single-unit trucks or vans which would have shorter delivery times


Transportation Concurrency
The City of Seattle has implemented a Transportation Concurrency system to comply with
one of the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA). The
system, described in the DPD Director’s Rule 5-2009 and the City’s Land Use and Zoning
Code, is designed to provide a mechanism that determines whether adequate transportation
facilities would be available “concurrent” with proposed development projects.

The screenline closest to the project site were chosen for review. The screenline that was
analyzed for concurrency review include East of CBD (Screenline 12.12), Ship
Canal/Montlake Bridge (Screenline 5.16), and South of S Jackson St – 12th Ave S to
Lakeside Ave (Screenline 10.12) as shown in Table 8. As a conservative estimate, it was
assumed that all project-generated traffic traveling in the direction of the screenline would
extend across the screenline included in the analysis.

The transportation concurrency analysis indicates that with traffic generated by the project,
the screenline would have v/c ratios less than the City v/c threshold; thus, the project would
meet the City’s concurrency requirements.


Parking Analysis
The following describes the proposed parking supply, estimated peak parking demand of the
project, and parking code requirements.

Supply
Parking for the proposed project would be provided by an on-site parking garage with 355
vehicle parking stalls with 234 stalls for residential and 121 stalls for the supermarket . In
addition, 98 bicycle spaces would also be provided in or near the proposed garage. The
parking garage would be accessed via Harvard Avenue between Madison Street and Spring
Street.

Demand
The anticipated parking demand of the proposed development was estimated based on data
provided by local vehicle ownership data for the project’s census tract2. An analysis was
completed to estimate the approximate parking demand of the proposed development.

The peak parking demand for the apartment uses are expected to be below national
averages due the project’s proximity to transit service and its location in a high-density urban
center with a strong mix of office, residential, and commercial spaces. The parking rate used
to estimate the peak parking demand for the apartments is based on average vehicle
ownership3 from US Census data. Based on the proposed mix of apartment units,4 a parking
rate of 0.71 vehicles per dwelling unit was used for tenants, which results in a parking
demand of 188 vehicles. Visitor parking was estimated by using the ULI Apartment visitor
rate of 0.15 vehicles per unit which equates to 40 vehicles. The total parking demand for the
residential component of the development is estimated to be 228 vehicles. The peak parking
demand generally occurs overnight. As stated above, there are 234 residential parking stalls
proposed which accommodates the anticipated peak demand of 228 vehicles.

Peak parking demand for the retail component was also calculated using ITE Parking
Generation (4th Edition, 2010) using Land Use Code 850 – Supermarket in an suburban
setting and applying the same mode split as was used to determine the vehicular trip

generation for the site. The estimated parking demand during the peak hour of operations on
an average day for the retail use is 45 vehicles and is expected to occur during midday
business operations. During certain days of the week and times of the year, the highest peak
parking demand may be greater than the average peak parking demand of 45 vehicles. The
parking garage has been designed to provide spaces for the peak demand to prevent
overspill of tenants onto City streets.

The total parking demand for all land uses of the proposed development is 273 vehicles
which includes residential tenants and visitors and retail parking. Although not anticipated to
occur concurrently, the peak for both uses could be accommodated by the proposed parking
supply of 355 parking stalls.
Parking Code Analysis
As noted previously, the project includes 355 garage parking spaces for the residential and
retail uses. Per Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.54.015, there are no automobile parking
requirements in the code for this development as it is located within the First Hill Urban
Center.

Secure, visible and easy to use bicycle parking promotes the use of bicycle travel to and from
a site. Beyond the environmental and health benefits of bicycle travel, provisions for cyclists
reduce the automobile traffic and parking impacts of a development and support many City
and neighborhood comprehensive plan goals. Adequate and well-designed bicycle parking is
also important to keep sidewalks fully ADA compliant and passible, and reduces the chances
of bicycles obstructing emergency escape routes.

                                   Mitigation Summary
The project is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018. Based on the operation
analyses at the study intersections and anticipated impacts of project traffic on the
surrounding street network, it is anticipated that the existing infrastructure surrounding the
proposed project will be sufficient to accommodate the off-site vehicles, transit, and non-
motorized trips generated by the proposed development with negligible impacts in the study
area. Given the traffic and parking impacts identified in this report, no off-site mitigation
measures would be necessary to offset the transportation related impacts of the project.

                            Findings and Conclusions
This TIA summarizes the transportation impacts associated with of the mixed-use
development located at 1001 Broadway in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle. General
findings and recommendations include:

          The proposed project would develop up to 265 apartment units along with an
           approximately 46,700 square feet grocery store on the street level. This
           development is anticipated to be constructed and occupied by 2018.
          After accounting for the existing uses on the project site, the development is
           anticipated to generate 1,270 net new vehicular weekday daily trips, with 125 new
           trips occurring during the weekday PM peak hour.
          The off-site study intersections would operate at LOS D or better and would operate
           at the same LOS during the weekday PM peak hour for future conditions without
           and with the project.
          Access to the proposed parking garage would be provided via Harvard Avenue
           between Spring Street and Broadway. The access driveway would operate at LOS
           B during the weekday PM peak hour with the addition of project generated traffic.
          The project would meet City’s transportation concurrency requirements.
          The proposed parking garage of 355 vehicle parking stalls would accommodate the
           anticipated average peak parking demand of 228 parking spaces for the residential
           land use and 45 spaces for the retail component of the development.
          No off-site mitigation measures would be required to offset the transportation
           related impacts of the project. As part of the project’s street improvement plan, new
           sidewalk with an extended curb bulb at the Harvard Avenue / Broadway intersection
           would be constructed to provide a shorter pedestrian crossing at this intersection as
           well as a better alignment of traffic onto Harvard Avenue. A stop-sign on Spring
           Street at Harvard Avenue may be installed by SDOT due to the increase in traffic
           volumes at this location. This would allow for a controlled pedestrian crossing and
           would reduce vehicle turning movement conflicts at the intersection.

Signalized intersection level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a weighted average control delay for
the entire intersection. Control delay quantifies the increase in travel time that a vehicle experiences due
to the traffic signal control as well as provides a surrogate measure for driver discomfort and fuel
consumption. Signalized intersection LOS is stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle (in
seconds) during a specified time period (e.g., weekday PM peak hour). Control delay is a complex
measure based on many variables, including signal phasing and coordination (i.e., progression of
movements through the intersection and along the corridor), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity and resulting queues. Table 1 summarizes the LOS criteria for signalized
intersections, as described in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (Transportation Research Board,
2010).

1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio for a lane group exceeds 1.0 LOS F is assigned to the individual lane group. LOS for overall approach or
      intersection is determined solely by the control delay.




Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further reduced into two intersection types: all-way stop
and two-way stop control. All-way stop control intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the weighted
average control delay of the overall intersection or by approach. Two-way stop-controlled intersection
LOS is defined in terms of the average control delay for each minor-street movement (or shared
movement) as well as major-street left-turns. This approach is because major-street through vehicles are
assumed to experience zero delay, a weighted average of all movements results in very low overall
average delay, and this calculated low delay could mask deficiencies of minor movements. Table 2 shows
LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections.

                 1. If the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio exceeds 1.0, LOS F is assigned an individual lane group for all unsignalized
                    intersections, or minor street approach at two-way stop-controlled intersections. Overall intersection LOS is
                    determined solely by control delay.
