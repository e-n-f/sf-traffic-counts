1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The proposed project is a passenger terminal at Paine Field. The project will consist of 20 daily
76-seat aircraft operations and 20 weekly 150-seat aircraft operations, with each operation being
either an arrival (landing) or a departure (takeoff). These operations are anticipated to result in 956
average daily vehicle trips including 212 peak-hour vehicle trips added to the surrounding
roadways and intersections. The trip generation calculations were performed using the anticipated
operations and a comparison to Bellingham International Airport operations and the Institute of
Transportation Engineers. The peak-hour trip generation is conservatively high since it has been
assumed that one arrival and one departure for each aircraft type will occur in one hour and all
passengers will arrive and depart Paine Field in that hour.

The trips from the project were distributed onto the surrounding road system based on regional
data provided by the Puget Sound Regional Council area model, existing traffic patterns from the
local area, other approved distributions from the local area and input from Snohomish County and
City of Everett staff. The project may change some travel patterns in the Puget Sound region since
it is anticipated that the project may divert some vehicle trips to Paine Field from Sea-Tac
International Airport and Bellingham International Airport. This change in regional travel patterns
could reduce the number of vehicles at the intersections and along the arterials analyzed in this
report. However, a reduction has not been included in the analysis. The distribution of trips
therefore assumes all of the trips generated by the project are new.

There are a total of three Snohomish County arterial units that meet the threshold for analysis and
eleven WSDOT, City of Mukilteo and City of Everett intersections that were requested for analysis
and meet the threshold for analysis. All of these arterials and intersections were analyzed for level
of service. The level of service analysis was conducted for existing conditions, 2022 baseline
conditions and 2022 future with project conditions. The only road improvement included in the
analysis is the signal improvements along Airport Road/128th Street SW between SR-99 and the
I-5 southbound ramps.

The following Snohomish County arterials units have been analyzed in both directions as part of
this report:

      #227 – Beverly Park Road (AM and PM peak-hours)
      #228 – Airport Road/128th Street SW (AM and PM peak-hours)
      #231 – Airport Road (AM and PM peak-hours)

The following WSDOT intersections, designated by their associated study intersection numbers,
have been analyzed as part of this report:

   1. SR-525 at Beverly Park Road
   13. I-5 Southbound Ramps at 128th Street SW
   18. I-5 Northbound Ramps at 128th Street SW
   21. Airport Road at SR-526 Westbound Ramps

Paine Field Passenger Terminal                                               Traffic Impact Analysis

The following City of Mukilteo intersections, designated by their associated study intersection
numbers, have been analyzed as part of this report:

   22. SR-526/Paine Field Boulevard at 84th Street SW
   23. 44th Avenue W at 84th Street SW
   24. SR-525 at 84th Street SW

The following City of Everett intersections, designated by their associated study intersection
numbers, have been analyzed as part of this report:

   6. Beverly Park Road at Airport Road
   7. SR-99 at Airport Road
   19. Airport Road at 112th Street SW
   20. Airport Road at Casino Road
   25. SR-526 Westbound Ramps at Evergreen Way

The project will not cause any Snohomish County arterials or any WSDOT, City of Mukilteo or
City of Everett intersections to change from an acceptable to a deficient level of service. All of the
Snohomish County arterials analyzed in this report are anticipated to operate at acceptable levels
of service under the 2022 future with project conditions.

The project will, however, add trips to two intersections that are anticipated to operate at deficient
levels of service, whether or not the proposed project is implemented. These intersections are SR-
525 at Beverly Park Road (WSDOT intersection) and SR-99 at Airport Road (City of Everett
intersection). The City of Mukilteo has a planned improve that will reduce the volume at the
intersection of SR-525 at Beverly Park Road, to which traffic mitigation fees are being paid, and
the City of Everett has identified that capacity improvements for single-occupancy vehicles to the
intersection of SR-99 at Airport Road are not practical due to the existing lane configuration and
lack of right-of-way.

The Washington Growth Management Act (GMA) and Revised Code of Washington (RCW)
82.02.050(2) authorize local jurisdictions to establish proportionate share traffic mitigation fees in
order to fund capital facilities, such as roads and intersections. Snohomish County Code (SCC)
30.66B applies that authority to developments in order to fund road improvements that would
accommodate development. Additionally, through SCC 30.66B and the State Environmental
Policy Act (SEPA), Snohomish County has established reciprocal traffic mitigation fee interlocal
agreements with WSDOT and the City of Mukilteo that are within the influence area of the project.
Based on the trip generation and identified codes, the total traffic mitigation fees identified in this
report for payment to Snohomish County, WSDOT and the City of Mukilteo for the project is
$333,262.85. The Snohomish County mitigation fees are $206,161.40, the WSDOT mitigation
fees are $32,695.20 and the City of Mukilteo mitigation fees are $94,406.25.

2. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION

Gibson Traffic Consultants (GTC) has been retained to analyze the traffic impacts of the Paine
Field Passenger Terminal, the project. GTC is a Snohomish County approved professional traffic
engineering consulting firm registered and licensed in the State of Washington.

GTC is located at:

2802 Wetmore Avenue

Email: bradl@gibsontraffic.com

Brad Lincoln, responsible for this report and traffic analysis, is a licensed professional engineer
(Civil) in the State of Washington and member of the Washington State section of ITE.

The project will add a commercial passenger terminal to Paine Field, which currently serves only
general aviation. This project will require building permits and therefore an analysis of the traffic
impacts of the project is required. Paine Field is located in Snohomish County Transportation
Service Area D (TSA D). The access to the project will be from the existing intersection of Airport
Road at 100th Street SW. This intersection is currently signalized and provides the primary access
to Paine Field. A site vicinity map is included in Figure 1.

The airlines that will provide service at Paine Field are not currently known. However, general
assumptions based on previous proposals for commercial service at Paine Field have been utilized.
It is anticipated that there will be 20 daily operations with a 76-seat aircraft and 20 weekly
operations from a 150-seat aircraft. For the purposes of this report, each operation is either an
arrival or a departure and it has been assumed the operations will be evenly split between arrivals
and departures. Additionally, it has been assumed that the full operations will occur by the year
2022, a 6-year horizon period. Impacts to Snohomish County arterials and intersections within the
surrounding jurisdictions have been analyzed within this report.

3. METHODOLOGY

   3.1 General

Trip generation for the project is based on anticipated operations information provided by Propeller
Airports, information collected at Bellingham International Airport and a comparison to Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE) data. Data was collected from Bellingham International Airport
since the service is most similar to the Paine Field passenger terminal. The trip generation
methodology was previously discussed with Jim Bloodgood, the Snohomish County Traffic
Engineer, and input from those discussions has been incorporated into the trip generation
calculations. Additionally, this report includes a revised analysis from the previous May 2016
report based on comments, dated June 21, 2016, from Snohomish County staff. These comments
and other scoping documents are included in the attachments.

The distribution of trips generated by the project is based on regional modeling information
provided by Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), review by the Snohomish County Traffic
Engineer with consultation from the Snohomish County traffic modeling group, traffic studies
approved in the site vicinity and peak-hour turning movement counts at the surrounding
intersections. The trip distribution was previously provided to Snohomish County, the City of
Mukilteo and the City of Everett for comment. The trip distribution used in this report includes
comments from Snohomish County and City of Everett staff.

Congestion at intersections is generally measured in terms of level of service (LOS). In accordance
with the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), road facilities and intersections are rated
between LOS A and LOS F, with LOS A being free flow and LOS F being forced flow or over-
capacity conditions. The level of service at signalized, roundabout and all-way stop-controlled
intersections is based on the average delay of all approaches. The level of service for two-way
stop-controlled intersections is based on average delays for the critical stopped approach.
Geometric characteristics and conflicting traffic movements are taken into consideration when
determining level of service values. A summary of the intersection level of service criteria is
included in Table 1.

The City of Mukilteo and the City of Everett have a level of service threshold of LOS D for the
operation of their intersections. WSDOT has a level of service threshold of LOS D for intersections
along SR-525 and SR-526 and a threshold of LOS E for I-5 interchange ramps.

The levels of service for the arterials analyzed in this report are based on the Snohomish County
category. Arterials are also rated between LOS A and LOS F by Snohomish County. A summary
of the Snohomish County arterial level of service criteria is included in Table 2.




1   Source: Highway Capacity Manual 2010.

     LOS A: Free-flow traffic conditions, with minimal delay to stopped vehicles (no vehicle is delayed longer
              than one cycle at signalized intersection).
     LOS B: Generally stable traffic flow conditions.
     LOS C: Occasional back-ups may develop, but delay to vehicles is short term and still tolerable.
     LOS D: During short periods of the peak hour, delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial but are
              tolerable during times of less demand (i.e. vehicles delayed one cycle or less at signal).
     LOS E: Intersections operate at or near capacity, with long queues developing on all approaches and long
              delays.
     LOS F: Jammed conditions on all approaches with excessively long delays and vehicles unable to move at
              times.
2   When demand volume exceeds the capacity of the lane, extreme delays will be encountered with queuing which
    may cause severe congestion affecting other traffic movements in the intersection.

Snohomish County has a level of service threshold of LOS E for the operation of their arterials.

The intersection and arterial level of service analysis has been performed using the existing
programmed lane configuration, intersection control, peak-hour factors and heavy vehicle
percentages.

The arterial analysis in this report has been performed using the Synchro 9.1, Build 904 software
and according to Snohomish County’s methodology for analyzing arterial units. The arterials were
calibrated in Synchro 9.1 for arterial speeds and intersection delays to match the existing data as
close as possible while using the existing signal timing information. The main function used to
calibrate the delay at the intersections along the analyzed arterials to the existing travel time and
signal delay is adjustment of the total lost time. In a few instances the saturation flow rate was
reduced to better reflect the existing delay from the travel time data. The arterial analysis in this
report accounts for the Snohomish County comments regarding the arterial level of service analysis
documented in the June 21, 2016 memorandum.

The WSDOT, City of Mukilteo and City of Everett intersections have been analyzed using the
existing signal timings, peak-hour factors and heavy-vehicle factors for the intersections. These
are the only factors that are required to be calibrated by the surrounding jurisdictions for the
intersection analysis. There are several intersections that were analyzed as part of the arterial
analysis and as part of the analysis for the surrounding jurisdictions.

   3.2 Scope of Analysis

The analysis of the impact of the project on Snohomish County arterials is based on the
requirements of SCC 30.66B for developments within unincorporated Snohomish County that
generate 50 or more peak-hour trips. Snohomish County requires the analysis of critical arterial
units and arterial units in arrears impacted with 3 or more directional peak-hour trips from
developments generating 50 or more peak-hour trips. Developments within unincorporated
Snohomish County are also required to show peak-hour development trips at Snohomish County
key intersections impacted with 3 or more directional peak-hour trips on any approach or
departure.

Paine Field Passenger Terminal                                              Traffic Impact Analysis

The analysis of impacts to intersections within the surrounding jurisdictions is based on the
interlocal agreements between Snohomish County and the surrounding jurisdictions and the
requirements of the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA). The surrounding jurisdictions
include WSDOT the City of Mukilteo and the City of Everett. The methodology and scope of level
of service for impacts to surrounding jurisdictions is based on previous discussions with staff from
the surrounding jurisdictions.

The interlocal agreement between Snohomish County and WSDOT typically requires WSDOT
intersections within unincorporated Snohomish County impacted with 10 or more PM peak-hour
trips from developments generating more than 50 PM peak-hour trips to be analyzed for existing
and future conditions, unless scoped differently with WSDOT. This report includes analysis of all
intersections identified by WSDOT staff and impacted with 10 PM peak-hour trips. The project
will account for less than 1.0% of the traffic on the roadway on SR-525 south of Beverly Park
Road (see pages E-1 and F-1 of the attachments), SR-99 south of Airport Road (see pages E-7 and
F-7 of the attachments) and SR-96 east of the I-5 northbound ramps (see page F-18). Intersections
along SR-525 south of Beverly Park Road, SR-99 south of Airport Road and SR-96 east of the I-
5 northbound ramps have therefore not been analyzed due to the low impact of the project. The
interlocal agreement also provides for mitigation fees to WSDOT for improvement/collection
projects impacted within the development’s unincorporated Transportation Service Area (TSA).
Mitigation fees are based on the area wide mitigation fee or the fee for impacts to individual
WSDOT collection projects.

The interlocal agreement between Snohomish County and the City of Mukilteo requires existing
and future analysis of City of Mukilteo arterial intersections impacted with 10 or more directional
PM peak-hour trips. The interlocal agreement also includes a provision for the payment of
mitigation fees based on pre-determined areas or impacts to actual improvement projects.

Snohomish County and the City of Everett do not have an interlocal agreement; however, impacts
to City of Everett intersections have been analyzed under the requirements of SEPA. The City of
Everett uses a threshold of 50 or more total PM peak-hour trips to determine which intersections
require level of service analysis. This threshold has therefore been used to determine which City
of Everett intersections require level of service analysis. The City of Everett is responsible for the
highway intersections within the incorporated part of their Urban Growth Boundary. Therefore,
the 50 peak-hour trip threshold is to be used for highway intersections within the City of Everett
as the threshold for analysis, based on comments from the City of Everett. However, the
intersection of Evergreen Way at the SR-526 westbound ramps has been analyzed at the request
of WSDOT, despite only being impacted with 10 PM peak-hour trips. Mitigation for impacts to
City of Everett intersections is only required under SEPA, there are not pre-determined mitigation
fees.

The analysis of the impacts of the project has been performed for the following conditions:

4. TRIPS FROM THE PROJECT

       4.1 Trip Generation

Trip generation for the project is based on anticipated operations provided by Propeller Airports,
data collected at Bellingham International Airport, discussions with Snohomish County’s traffic
engineer and a comparison to ITE data. Detailed data for the 76-seat and 150-seat aircraft and
operations that are anticipated to occur at Paine Field is summarized in Table 3.

It is important to note that the operations per day in Table 3 are based on the full operations. It has
been assumed that these full operations will occur by the year 2022. Along with the airlines, it is
anticipated that there will be a total of 17 new employees over two shifts at Paine Field due to the
proposed passenger terminal. It has been anticipated that half of the employees on each shift will
generate a trip during the peak-hour with the trips evenly split between inbound and outbound
trips.

The trip generation calculations are based on the data in Table 3 and input from the Snohomish
County Traffic Engineer. The peak-hour trip generation calculations have been performed
assuming that all of the passengers will arrive during the same hour and there is one arrival and
one departure for each aircraft type. This assumption is conservatively high since data from
Propeller Airlines and data collected at Bellingham International Airport suggests a timeframe
closer to two hours for an arrival and departure. The peak-hour trip generation calculations
performed for this report also assume a load factor of 90% for both aircraft types, which is higher
than a typical system-wide load factor of 73%. The use of a 90% load factor for both aircraft types
increases the number of peak-hour trips generated, as compared to the system-wide 73% factor.
The system-wide load factor of 73% has been utilized for the daily trip generation for the 76-seat
aircraft. The trip generation calculations are summarized in Table 4 for the daily trip generation.

The peak-hour trip generation is assumed to occur during both the AM and PM peak-hour, which
is a conservative estimate. The assumption that there will be one arrival and one departure for each
of the aircrafts during the AM and PM peak-hours will alone result in 20 operations for both
aircraft types between Monday and Friday. This is equal to, or greater than, the anticipated weekly
operations, including the weekends. Additionally, the trip generation during the AM and PM peak-
hours (a 2-hour period) would account for nearly half of the total daily trip generation (a 24-hour
period). However, the assumption that there is one arrival and one departure for each airline results
in an analysis of the highest possible impacts of the project.

   4.2 Trip Generation Comparison

The critical peak-hour trip generation was also compared to data provided in the ITE Trip
Generation, 9th Edition (2012). ITE is the resource that is used for typical residential and
commercial developments. ITE Land Use Code 021 is the code for a commercial airport. ITE’s
data shows that there would be 6.43 AM peak-hour trips per flight and 6.88 PM peak-hour trips
per flight. Utilizing the ITE data would result in the project generating 157 PM peak-hour trips,
which is approximately 74% of the anticipated PM peak-hour trips using aircraft data. This shows
the conservative nature of the trip generation used for this report since most of the airports used
for the ITE data have bigger airplanes and therefore more vehicle trips per flight.

These trip generation calculations were also compared to data collected at Bellingham
International Airport. Data was collected between 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM by the independent count
firm of Traffic Data Gathering (TDG). Data was collected during this timeframe since it included
an arrival and departure for similar aircraft types used for the peak-hour trip generation calculations
for the project. The data collected at Bellingham International Airport showed a trip generation of

Paine Field Passenger Terminal                                              Traffic Impact Analysis

201 trips during the peak 2-hour period and an average vehicle occupancy rate of 2.08. This data
is within approximately 5% of the anticipated trip generation for the project. The weighted average
vehicle occupancy for the project is 2.10, which is within 1% of the average vehicle occupancy
calculated for Bellingham International Airport.

It is important to note that the data collected at the Bellingham International Airport is over a 2-
hour period, which included one arrival and one departure for similar aircraft. The peak-hour at
Bellingham International Airport, which had 148 trips, is only 74% of the peak 2-hour period,
which has 201 trips. The data collected at Bellingham International Airport should therefore
validate that the peak-hour trip generation calculations for the Paine Field passenger terminal as
conservatively high.

   4.3 Off-Site Trip Generation Summary

The project is anticipated to generate 966 total average daily trips with 214 total trips occurring
during the peak-hour. However, it is not anticipated that all of these trips will impact the off-site
street system, the arterials and intersections of Snohomish County, WSDOT, the City of Mukilteo
and the City of Everett. It is anticipated that at least 1% of the trips generated will remain on the
Paine Field grounds and will travel to and from the surrounding uses, which include aviation type
uses. It is therefore anticipated that only 956 average daily trips and 212 peak-hour trips will be
added to the arterials and intersections of Snohomish County, WSDOT, the City of Mukilteo and
the City of Everett. The off-site trip generation is summarized in Table 6.

The impacts of these off-site trips are what have been analyzed in this report. It is important to
note that these trip generation calculations do not include a 5% reduction for on-site Transportation
Demand Management measures, which is discussed in more detail later in this report.

A qualitative analysis of the trips generated by the construction of the proposed Paine Field
passenger terminal has been performed for this report. The construction of the terminal is
anticipated to consist of truck traffic and approximately 30 to 40 employees on the site. Based on
this information, the construction traffic is not anticipated to exceed the 956 average daily trips
and 212 peak-hour trips generated by the full operations of the project that have been evaluated in
this report. An analysis of the impacts of the construction traffic has therefore not been performed
as part of this report.

   4.4 Trip Distribution

The distribution of trips generated by the project is based on regional modeling information
provided by PSRC, review by the Snohomish County Traffic Engineer with consultation from the
Snohomish County traffic modeling group, City of Everett staff, traffic studies approved in the site
vicinity and peak-hour turning movement counts at the surrounding intersections. The trip
distribution was provided to Snohomish County for comment prior to the publication of this report.
The distribution was reviewed and approved by the Snohomish County Traffic Engineer prior to
the publication of this report. A detailed trip distribution is included in Figure 2.

       4.4.1. Regional Distribution

It is anticipated that 48% of the trips will travel to and from the south along Beverly Park Road,
SR-99, SR-525, Interstate-5, SR-527 and 35th Avenue SE. Approximately 32% of the trips will
travel to and from the north along SR-525, 20th Avenue W, SR-99/Evergreen Way and Interstate-
5. It is estimated that 14% of the trips will travel to and from the east, mainly to and from local
areas between Paine Field and Interstate-5. The remaining 6% of the trips are anticipated to travel
to and from the west, mainly to and from local areas around SR-525 and SR-526.

       4.4.2. Local Distribution

It is anticipated that 50% of the trips will travel to and from the south along Airport Road in the
vicinity of the development. These trips will be split between trips along Beverly Park Road
(thirteen percent), trips along 112th Street SW (two percent), trips along SR-99 (ten percent) and
trips along 128th Street SW (twenty-five percent). Approximately 40% of the trips will travel to
and from the north along Airport Road in the vicinity of the development. These trips will be split
between Casino Road (two percent) and SR-526 (twelve percent to and from the west and twenty-
six percent to and from the east). The remaining 10% of the trips will travel to and from the east
along 100th Street SW.

       4.4.3. Snohomish County Key Intersection Impacts

Snohomish County requires development to provide detailed turning movement information for
key intersections impacted with 3 or more directional peak-hour trips. The key intersections
impacted with 3 or more directional peak-hour trips from the project are shown in the attachments
in graphical and tabular format.

5. TURNING MOVEMENT VOLUMES

AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes have been either collected or calculated for the
following three conditions:

   1. Existing Conditions
   2. 2022 Baseline Conditions
   3. 2022 Future with Project Conditions

The year 2022 has been utilized for the baseline and future with project conditions to represent a
6-year horizon period from the date of this report. The methodology used to determine the turning
movements for each of these conditions is discussed in the following sections.

   5.1 Existing Turning Movements

Existing peak-hour turning movement volumes were obtained from Snohomish County or were
collected by the independent count firms of TDG and IDAX. All of the existing turning movement
volumes used in this report were collected in the years 2015 and 2016. The existing counts used
for the analysis in this report are included in the attachments.

   5.2 2022 Baseline Turning Movements

The 2022 baseline turning movements have been calculated by adding pipeline data from
Snohomish County or applying an annually compounding growth rate and pipeline trips from
specific developments. Snohomish County pipeline data is available for the majority of the study
intersections. Snohomish County pipeline data includes the Fairmount Elementary Kindergarten
Expansion, but does not include trips at the site access, which is a study intersection. Trips have
therefore been assigned at the Fairmount Elementary access. Snohomish County pipeline data was
extrapolated to adjacent intersections along Airport Road where pipeline data is not available.

An annually compounding growth rate and trips from the Pacific Seafood development have been
used at select study intersections where Snohomish County pipeline was not available. A 1%
annually compounding growth rate was applied for select intersections where Snohomish County
pipeline data was not available. The annually compounding growth rate is based on growth at other
study intersections from Snohomish County pipeline data. Trips from the Pacific Seafood
development have been added to study intersections along 84th Street SW, which are the
intersections impacted by the majority of the trips from the development.

   5.3 2022 Future with Project Turning Movements

The 2022 future with project turning movements were calculated by adding the trips from the
project to the 2022 baseline turning movements.

All of the turning movement calculations are included in the attachments of this report.

6. SNOHOMISH COUNTY ARTERIAL IMPACTS

Snohomish County uses impacts to arterial units to evaluate the concurrency of a development.
Critical arterial units, arterial units in arrears and arterial units at ultimate capacity impacted with
3 directional peak-hour trips are required to be analyzed for developments generating 50 or more
peak-hour trips. In addition, Snohomish County requires arterial units impacted with 50 or more
directional peak-hour trips to be analyzed. The arterial units within TSA D impacted with 3 or
more directional and 50 or more directional peak-hour trips from the project are summarized in
Table 7.

The directions that have been analyzed are based on the critical directions impacted with 3 or more
directional peak-hour trips or the directions impacted with 50 directional peak-hour trips. The
arterials studied for this report are all located within the urban area. Arterial Units #227 and #231
are Urban Category II arterials. Urban Category II arterials have an acceptable arterial travel speed
threshold of 13 mph. Arterial Unit #228 is classified as an Urban Category III arterial. Urban
Category III arterials have an acceptable arterial travel speed threshold of 10 mph.

The trips from the project will not impact any arterial units in arrears or arterial units at ultimate
capacity with 3 or more directional peak-hour trips.

The operation of the arterial units is based on travel speeds along the arterial and delay at the
signalized intersections along the arterial. The signalized intersections that have been analyzed as
part of the AM and PM peak-hour arterial analysis are:

The existing signal timings for the study intersections are based on data received from Snohomish
County and WSDOT. The existing signal timings have been used for the existing, 2022 baseline
and 2022 future with project analysis, except along Airport Road/128th Street SW (Arterial Unit
#228). Snohomish County has a planned signal improvement project along this corridor to provide
adaptive signal timings, which will adjust the signal timings to better handle changes in traffic
volumes.

The existing turning movements for the arterial analysis are shown in Figure 3 for the AM peak-
hour and Figure 4 for the PM peak-hour. The 2022 baseline turning movements are shown in
Figure 5 for the AM peak-hour arterial analysis are shown and Figure 6 for the PM peak-hour
arterial analysis. The trips generated by the project used for the arterial analysis are shown in
Figure 7 for the AM peak-hour and Figure 8 for the PM peak-hour. The arterial turning movements
for the 2022 future with project conditions are shown in Figure 9 for the AM peak-hour and Figure
10 for the PM peak-hour.

Snohomish County staff requested that the intersection of Beverly Park Road at 121st Street SE be
included in the arterial analysis. This intersection is a stop-controlled intersection with only stop-
control on 121st Street SE. This intersection does not result in measurable delay along the Beverly
Park Road arterial (Arterial Unit #227). However, the intersection has been included in the arterial
analysis. The existing count data, pipeline data and turning movement calculations are included in
the attachments. This intersection is not shown in Figure 3 through 8 since it does not contribute
delay to the arterial unit.

   6.1 Arterial Unit #227 – Beverly Park Road

Arterial Unit #227, Beverly Park Road between SR-525 and Airport Road, is a 1.35 mile long
arterial that is critical in the southbound direction during the AM and PM peak-hours. The analysis
in this report includes changes based on Snohomish County staff comments from the June 21, 2016
memorandum.

       6.1.1. Existing Conditions

The existing arterial travel time data for Arterial Unit #227 was collected by the independent count
firm TDG in May 2015. The network for Arterial Unit #227 in the Synchro software was calibrated
to within 1 second for the total delay and to within 0.1 mph of the arterial travel speed from the
field data for the AM and PM peak-hours. The arterial unit in the southbound direction currently
operates at acceptable LOS D during the AM peak-hour and acceptable LOS E during the PM
peak-hour.

       6.1.2. 2022 Baseline Conditions

The additional trips due to the Snohomish County pipeline trips will cause the arterial travel speeds
to decrease from their levels under the existing conditions. However, the southbound direction
during the AM peak-hour and PM peak-hour is anticipated to remain at the same level of service
as the existing conditions, LOS D and LOS E, respectively.

       6.1.3. 2022 Future with Project Conditions

The trips from the project are not anticipated to significantly affect the arterial travel speed of
Arterial Unit #227 during either the AM or PM peak-hours in the southbound direction. The delay
during the AM and PM peak-hours is anticipated to increase by 6 seconds of less. The arterial in
the southbound direction will operate at acceptable LOS E during the AM and PM peak-hours with
the project.

       6.1.4. Conclusions for Arterial Unit #227 – Beverly Park Road

Arterial Unit #227, Beverly Park Road between SR-525 and Airport Road, will operate at an
acceptable level of service in the southbound direction during the AM and PM peak-hours with
the project. The southbound direction is anticipated to operate at LOS E during the AM and PM
peak-hours with the project. The AM peak-hour arterial level of service analysis is summarized in
Table 8 and the PM peak-hour arterial analysis is summarized in Table 9.

The level of service calculations for Arterial Unit #227 are included in the attachments of this
report. The northbound direction during the AM and PM peak-hours is included in the Synchro
outputs, but is not included as part of this analysis since the northbound direction is not critical
and not impacted with 50 directional peak-hour trips.

   6.2 Arterial Unit #228 – Airport Road/128th Street SW

Arterial Unit #228, Airport Road/128th Street SW between SR-99 and the Interstate-5 southbound
ramps, is a 1.34 mile long arterial that is critical in the westbound direction during the AM peak-
hour and the westbound and eastbound direction during the PM peak-hour. Arterial Unit #228 is
an Urban Category III arterial, which has an acceptable arterial travel speed threshold of 10 mph.

Snohomish County has a planned signal improvement project along Arterial Unit #228 that will
allow signals to better handle changes in flow of traffic. Snohomish County staff identified that
optimizing the corridor was the best way to model the planned signal improvements. The signal
improvements were modeled by applying a weighted optimization factor for the eastbound and
westbound directions in the Synchro software. These improvements have been applied to the 2022
baseline conditions and then remained the same for the 2022 future with project conditions. The
analysis in this report includes changes based on Snohomish County staff comments from the June
21, 2016 memorandum.

Paine Field Passenger Terminal                                              Traffic Impact Analysis

       6.2.1. Existing Conditions

The existing arterial travel time data for Arterial Unit #227 was collected by the independent count
firm TDG in the year 2015. The calibration is within 5 seconds of total travel time and the arterial
travel speed is within 0.1 mph of the arterial travel speed from the field data. The arterial unit
currently operates at acceptable LOS D in the westbound direction during the AM peak-hour.
During the PM peak-hour the westbound direction currently operates at LOS E and the westbound
direction operates at LOS D.

       6.2.2. 2022 Baseline Conditions

The delay decreases and the travel speeds increase along Arterial Unit #228 from the existing
conditions to the 2022 baseline conditions due to the planned signal improvements along the
corridor. The westbound direction is anticipated to operate at LOS D during the AM peak-hour
with the signal improvements. During the PM peak-hour the eastbound and westbound directions
are anticipated to remain at LOS E and LOS D, respectively, under the 2016 baseline conditions
with the signal improvements.

       6.2.3. 2022 Future with Project Conditions

The trips from the project are not anticipated to cause the level of service of Arterial Unit #228 to
change during either the AM or PM peak-hours. The delays along the arterial are anticipated to
increase and the arterial travel speeds are anticipated to decrease with the additional traffic from
the 2022 baseline conditions, but all of the arterials will remain at acceptable LOS E or better.
During the AM peak-hour the westbound direction will remain at LOS D under the 2022 future
with project conditions. The eastbound direction and westbound directions during the PM peak-
hour are anticipated to operate at LOS E and LOS D, respectively, under the 2022 future with
project conditions during the PM peak-hour.

       6.2.4. Conclusions for Arterial Unit #228 – Airport Road/128th Street SW

Arterial Unit #228, Airport Road/128th Street SW between SR-99 and the I-5 southbound ramps,
will operate at an acceptable level of service in the westbound direction during the AM peak-hour
and the eastbound and westbound directions during the PM peak-hour with the project. The
Snohomish County planned signal improvements along the corridor will help decrease the delay
and increase the travel time along the corridor. The westbound direction during the AM peak-hour
is anticipated to operate at LOS D with the project. The eastbound and westbound directions during
the PM peak-hour are anticipated to operate at LOS E and LOS D, respectively, with the project.
The AM peak-hour arterial level of service analysis is summarized in Table 10 for the westbound
direction. The PM peak-hour arterial level of service analysis is summarized in Table 11 for the
eastbound direction and Table 12 for the westbound direction.

The level of service calculations for Arterial Unit #228 are included in the attachments of this
report. The eastbound direction during the AM peak-hour is included in the Synchro outputs, but
is not included as part of this analysis since the eastbound direction is not critical and not impacted
with 50 directional peak-hour trips.

   6.3 Arterial Unit #231 – Airport Road

Arterial Unit #231, Airport Road between 106th Street SW and Kasch Park Road, is a 1.16 mile
long arterial that is impacted with 50 or more directional trips during the AM and PM peak-hours
in the northbound and southbound directions. The arterial is only currently classified as a critical
arterial by Snohomish County for the northbound direction during the PM peak-hour. The analysis
has been performed for the PM peak-hour between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM, based on scoping
discussions with Snohomish County staff. The analysis in this report includes changes based on
Snohomish County staff comments from the June 21, 2016 memorandum.

       6.3.1. Existing Conditions

The existing arterial travel time data for Arterial Unit #231 was collected by the independent count
firm TDG in May and September 2015. The network for Arterial Unit #231 in the Synchro software
was not able to be calibrated to similar delay, segment travel times and arterial travel speeds as the
field data. The delay along the arterial in the calibrated arterial systems is greater than the field
delay and the resulting arterial travel speed in the calibrated system is lower than the arterial travel
speed from the field data. The arterial travel speeds in the calibrated arterial systems are between
about 1.5 mph and 8.2 mph slower than the field data. The calibrated arterial systems show the
arterial operating at a worse level of service, which results in a conservatively low estimate of the
arterial operation. Therefore, the calibrated arterial systems for Arterial Unit #231 have been used
since they represent a conservative analysis of the arterial operations.

The northbound direction during the AM peak-hour has been calibrated to an arterial travel speed
of 27.6 mph, which is equivalent to LOS C, and is 1.5 mph slower than the field data. The
southbound direction during the AM peak-hour has been calibrated to LOS B with a travel speed
of 29.1 mph, which is 6.4 mph slower than the field data. The northbound and southbound
directions have both been calibrated to LOS C during the PM peak-hour with the northbound
direction having an arterial travel speed of 26.2 mph, 2.9 mph slower than the field data, and the
southbound direction having an arterial travel speed of 27.1 mph, 8.2 mph slower than the field
data.

       6.3.2. 2022 Baseline Conditions

The additional trips due to the Snohomish County pipeline trips will not change the levels of
service of Arterial Unit #231 from the existing calibrated levels of service. The northbound
direction during the AM peak-hour is anticipated to remain at LOS C and the southbound direction
during the AM peak-hour is anticipated to remain at LOS B. During the PM peak-hour the
northbound and southbound directions are both anticipated to remain at LOS C under the 2022
baseline conditions.

       6.3.3. 2022 Future with Project Conditions

The trips from the project will cause the arterial travel speeds to decrease along Arterial Unit #231.
The only direction that will change level of service with the trips from the project is the southbound
direction during the AM peak-hour, which is anticipated to operate at acceptable LOS C with the
project. The remaining directions will operate at the same level of service as the 2022 baseline
conditions with the project. The northbound and southbound directions during the AM and PM
peak-hours are all anticipated to operate at LOS C under the 2022 future with project conditions.

Arterial Unit #231, Airport Road between 106th Street SW and Kasch Park Road, will operate at
an acceptable LOS C in the northbound and southbound directions during the AM and PM peak-
hours with the project. The arterial level of service analysis for the AM peak-hour is summarized

It is important to note that the additional trips from the project cause the signal for the intersection
of Airport Road at 100th Street SW to use more of the cycle length. This causes the actuated signal
to utilize more green time for the northbound direction, reducing the delay for the northbound
direction and increasing the travel speed for the northbound direction.

   6.4 Summary of Arterial Impacts

The project will impact three Snohomish County arterials with 3 or more peak-hour trips in the
critical direction or with 50 or more peak-hour trips. The arterials analyzed under the requirements
of Snohomish County Code 30.66B will operate at acceptable levels of service under the 2022
future with project conditions. No additional improvements beyond the planned signal
improvements along Arterial #228 will be required to ensure the impacted arterials operate
acceptably with the project. The Paine Field passenger terminal should therefore be considered
concurrent based on the requirements of SCC 30.66B.


7. INTERSECTION ANALYSIS FOR SURROUNDING JURISDICTIONS

The trips from the project will impact intersections within the surrounding jurisdictions of
WSDOT, the City of Mukilteo and the City of Everett. Snohomish County has an interlocal
agreement with WSDOT and the City of Mukilteo that provides the methodology for determining
which intersections are to be analyzed. There is not an interlocal agreement between Snohomish
County and the City of Everett and therefore the analysis of impacts to intersections within the
City of Everett has been performed to satisfy SEPA requirements, after detailed scoping with the
City of Everett staff, and WSDOT scoping requirements.

The WSDOT, City of Mukilteo and City of Everett intersections that have been analyzed as part
of this report are summarized in Table 17.

The analysis of intersections for surrounding jurisdictions is based on the interlocal agreements,
the typical methodology for analysis of intersections and historical scoping discussions. WSDOT,
the City of Mukilteo and the City of Everett have identified the PM peak-hour as the required
analysis period under their interlocal agreements or under their own standards.

The City of Mukilteo intersections analyzed for this report are along principal arterials, which have
a level of service threshold of LOS E. The City of Everett use a level of service threshold of LOS
D and WSDOT uses a threshold of LOS D along SR-525 and SR-526. It is important to note that
WSDOT utilizes a threshold of LOS E for the I-5 ramps intersections based on the interlocal
agreement with Snohomish County. The typical threshold for analysis of WSDOT intersections in
unincorporated Snohomish County is 10 PM peak-hour trips. WSDOT intersections in the City of
Mukilteo or City of Everett follow the respective city threshold for analysis. The City of Mukilteo
uses a threshold of 10 directional peak-hour trips at arterial intersections while the City of Everett
uses a threshold of 50 PM peak-hour trips. WSDOT requested that the intersection of Evergreen
Way at SR-526 westbound ramps be analyzed even though the impacts of the project do not meet
the threshold for the City of Everett, which controls and operates the intersection.

The existing turning movements for the interlocal and SEPA intersection analysis are shown in
Figure 11 and the 2022 baseline conditions turning movements are shown in Figure 12. The trips
generated by the project used for the interlocal and SEPA intersection analysis are shown in Figure
13 and the turning movements for the 2022 future with project conditions are shown in Figure 14.

   7.1 Existing Conditions

The existing interlocal and SEPA analysis shows that the majority of the study intersections
operate within acceptable levels of service. There is one WSDOT intersection that currently
operates at LOS F, SR-525 at Beverly Park Road, and one City of Everett intersection that operates
at LOS E, SR-99 at Airport Road. Both of these intersections are addressed later in this report. All
of the City of Mukilteo intersections currently operate at LOS D or better. The intersection of 128th
Street SW at I-5 Southbound Ramps, which is an level of service under the provisions of the
interlocal agreement between Snohomish County and WSDOT.

   7.2 2022 Baseline Conditions

The 2022 baseline level of service analysis shows that the majority of the study intersections will
continue to operate at an acceptable level of service. The only exceptions are the intersections of
SR-525 at Beverly Park Road and SR-99 at Airport Road. Both of these intersections are discussed
in more detail later in this report.

   7.3 2022 Future with Project Conditions

The additional trips from the project will not change the anticipated level of service at the
intersections studied for the surrounding jurisdictions. The intersections of SR-525 at Beverly Park
Road and SR-99 at Airport Road are still anticipated to operate at LOS F and LOS E, respectively,
under the 2022 future with project conditions. The remaining intersections studied for the
surrounding jurisdictions are anticipated to continue operating within acceptable thresholds of the
surrounding jurisdictions under the 2022 future with project conditions.

   7.4 Summary of Impacts to Intersections of Surrounding Jurisdictions

The trips from the project are not anticipated to cause any of the study intersections for the
surrounding jurisdictions to operate below acceptable thresholds. The project will add trips to two
intersections operating below acceptable thresholds, SR-525 at Beverly Park Road (LOS F) and
SR-99 at Airport Road (LOS E). A summary of the intersection level of service analysis for the
surrounding jurisdictions is included in Table 18.

The City of Mukilteo has a planned improvement to create a link between Beverly Park Road and
Harbour Point Boulevard, west of SR-525, which will reduce the volume of trips at the intersection
of SR-525 at Beverly Park Road. Traffic mitigation fees for the City of Mukilteo are identified
later in this report. These traffic mitigation fees will help fund this planned improvement and
therefore mitigate the impacts of the Paine Field Passenger Terminal on the intersection of Sr-525
at Beverly Park Road.

The intersection of SR-99 at Airport Road currently operates at LOS E and is anticipated to remain
at LOS E under the 2022 future with project conditions. The City of Everett has indicated that
additional capacity improvements for single-occupancy vehicles to this intersection are not
practical due to the existing channelization and lack of right-of-way. However, the City of Everett
has instituted the SWIFT bus rapid transit along the SR-99 corridor.

8. MITIGATION

The Washington GMA and RCW 82.02.050(2) authorize local jurisdictions to establish
proportionate share traffic mitigation fees in order to fund capital facilities, such as roads and
intersections. SCC 30.66B applies that authority to developments in order to fund road
improvements that would accommodate development. Additionally, through SCC 30.66B and
SEPA, Snohomish County has established reciprocal traffic mitigation fee interlocal agreements
with WSDOT and the City of Mukilteo that are within the influence area of the project.

The project is located in Snohomish County, which assesses Transportation Demand Management
and general traffic mitigation fees for new trips generated within unincorporated Snohomish
County. In addition, Snohomish County has interlocal agreements with WSDOT and the City of
Mukilteo for reciprocal payment of mitigation fees. The Snohomish County, WSDOT and City of
Mukilteo traffic mitigation fees are assessed, regardless of a development’s impact on the
surrounding arterials and intersections. Transportation Demand Management can be satisfied
through on-site improvement or payment of the Transportation Demand Management mitigation
fee.

Snohomish County does not have an interlocal agreement with the City of Everett for the payment
of mitigation fees. However, the City of Everett can request mitigation for impacts to City of
Everett intersections through SEPA if its determined there is a significant impact.

   8.1 Transportation Demand Management

Snohomish County imposes Transportation Demand Management (TDM) as a way to reduce
single-occupancy vehicles during the AM and PM peak-hours. TDM mitigation can be satisfied
by paying a fee or providing adequate on-site measures. SCC 60.66B.640 requires pedestrian
improvements and bicycle parking to satisfy the on-site TDM requirements.

An existing pedestrian walkway from Airport Road to the project will satisfy the on-site pedestrian
walkway measures of TDM. Bicycle parking spaces for 5 bicycles, equal to 2% of the peak-hour
trips generated by the project, will need to be provided to satisfy the bicycle portion of the TDM
requirements.

Providing these on-site measures will mean that the project is not required to pay TDM mitigation
fees and will also receive a 5% credit towards the Snohomish County, WSDOT and City of
Mukilteo mitigation fees.

   8.2 Snohomish County

The project will be considered a commercial development for the purposes of assessing Snohomish
County traffic mitigation fees. Snohomish County traffic mitigation fees are $227 per daily trip
for commercial developments inside the Urban Growth Area (UGA). The project is anticipated to
generate 956 off-site daily trips for which traffic mitigation fees will be assessed. The Snohomish
County traffic mitigation fees for the project will be $206,161.40 with the 5% credit for the on-
site TDM measures. These mitigation fees are assessed by Snohomish County regardless of the
impact the project has on Snohomish County arterials.

   8.3 Washington State Department of Transportation

WSDOT has established an area-wide traffic mitigation fee of $36 per daily trip for developments
in Snohomish County. The 956 off-site daily trips generated by the project will result in WSDOT
traffic mitigation fees of $32,695.20 with the 5% credit for the on-site TDM measures.

   8.4 City of Mukilteo

Snohomish County and the City of Mukilteo have an interlocal agreement that provides for
reciprocal mitigation fees between the two jurisdictions. The project is located in Zone 4 of the
interlocal agreement. Projects in Zone 4 have a predetermined impact of 25% on City of Mukilteo
roadways, based on the interlocal agreement. The current City of Mukilteo traffic mitigation fee is
$1,875 per PM peak-hour trip. The project will generate 212 off-site PM peak-hour trips, for which
traffic mitigation fees will need to be paid. The City of Mukilteo traffic mitigation fee, based on a
25% impact for 212 off-site trips and a mitigation fee of $1,875 per PM peak-hour trip, is
$94,406.25 with the 5% credit for the on-site TDM measures.

   8.5 City of Everett

Snohomish County and the City of Everett do not have an interlocal agreement that provides for
reciprocal traffic mitigation fees. However, the project will add trips to the intersection of SR-99
at Airport Road, which operates at deficient LOS e under the existing and future conditions. City
of Everett staff previously indicated that additional improvements for single-occupancy vehicles
are not planned.

It is at the discretion of the City of Everett as to whether mitigation fees for impacts to the
intersection of SR-99 at Airport Road are required. If they are required, the traffic mitigation fees
for trips from the project should not be in excess of the proportionate share. The trips from the
project will account for 74 of the 4,555 trips anticipated at the intersection under the 2022 future
with project conditions (see pages F-7 of the attachments). These trips will account for a
proportionate share of 1.62%. The impact of trips from the project should not be considered
significant since the impact of trips is less than 2%, the change in delay is only 1.5 seconds with
the project and the intersection operates at LOS F under the existing conditions.

The traffic mitigation fees for the project include a 5% reduction for on-site TDM measures.


9. CONCLUSIONS

The Paine Field Passenger Terminal is anticipated to result in 956 average daily trips and 212
peak-hour trips impacting the surrounding roadways and intersections based on conservatively
high estimates. The trip generation includes the assumption that two arrivals and two departures,
one for each type of aircraft, will occur within a 1-hour period. Similar operations at Bellingham
International Airport show this operation occurring over a 2-hour period. These trips will not cause
any Snohomish County arterials or any WSDOT, City of Mukilteo or City of Everett intersections
analyzed for this report to operate at a deficient level of service. The total traffic mitigation fees
paid to Snohomish County, WSDOT and the City of Mukilteo for the project is $333,262.85. In
addition, there are existing pedestrian facilities to the terminal and bicycle facilities at the terminal
in the form of bike racks will be completed to satisfy the requirements of Transportation Demand
Management.
